a game of thrones book one of a song of ice and fire by george r r martin prologue we should start back gared urged as the woods began to grow dark around them the wildlings are dead do the dead frighten you ser waymar royce asked with just the hint of a smile gared did not rise to the bait he was an old man past fifty and he had seen the lordlings come and go dead is dead he said we have no business with the dead are they dead royce asked softly what proof have we will saw them gared said if he says they are dead thats proof enough for me will had known they would drag him into the quarrel sooner or later he wished it had been later rather than sooner my mother told me that dead men sing no songs he put in my wet nurse said the same thing will royce replied never believe anything you hear at a womans tit there are things to be learned even from the dead his voice echoed too loud in the twilit forest page we have a long ride before us gared pointed out eight days maybe nine and night is falling ser waymar royce glanced at the sky with disinterest it does that every day about this time are you unmanned by the dark gared will could see the tightness around gareds mouth the barely sup pressed anger in his eyes under the thick black hood of his cloak gared had spent forty years in the nights watch man and boy and he was not accustomed to being made light of yet it was more than that under the wounded pride will could sense something else in the older man you could taste it a nervous tension that came perilous close to fear will shared his unease he had been four years on the wall the first time he had been sent beyond all the old stories had come rushing back and his bowels had turned to water he had laughed about it afterward he was a veteran of a hundred rangings by now and the endless dark wilderness that the southron called the haunted forest had no more terrors for him until tonight something was different tonight there was an edge to this darkness that made his hackles rise nine days they had been riding north and northwest and then north again farther and farther from the wall hard on the track of a band of wildling raiders each day had been worse than the day that had come before it today was the worst of all a cold wind was blowing out of the north and it made the trees rustle like living things all day will had felt as though something were watching him something cold and implacable that loved him not gared had felt it too will wanted nothing so much as to ride hellbent for the safety of the wall but that was not a feeling to share with your commander especially not a commander like this one ser waymar royce was the youngest son of an ancient house with too many heirs he was a handsome youth of eighteen greyeyed and graceful and slender as a knife mounted on his huge black destrier the knight towered above will and gared on their smaller garrons he wore black leather boots black woolen pants black moleskin gloves and a fine supple coat of gleaming black ringmail over layers of black wool and boiled leather ser waymar had been a sworn brother of the nights watch for less than half a year but no one could say he had not prepared for his vocation at least insofar as his wardrobe was concerned his cloak was his crowning glory sable thick and black and soft as sin bet he killed them all himself he did gared told the barracks over wine twisted their little heads off our mighty warrior they had all shared the laugh it is hard to take orders from a man you laughed at in your cups will reflected as he sat shivering atop his garron gared must have felt the same mormont said as we should track them and we did gared said theyre dead they shant trouble us no more theres hard riding before us i dont like this weather if it snows we could be a fortnight getting back and snows the best we can hope for ever seen an ice storm my lord the lordling seemed not to hear him he studied the deepening twilight in that halfbored halfdistracted page way he had will had ridden with the knight long enough to understand that it was best not to interrupt him when he looked like that tell me again what you saw will all the details leave nothing out will had been a hunter before he joined the nights watch well a poacher in truth mallister freeriders had caught him redhanded in the mallisters own woods skinning one of the mallisters own bucks and it had been a choice of putting on the black or losing a hand no one could move through the woods as silent as will and it had not taken the black brothers long to discover his talent the camp is two miles farther on over that ridge hard beside a stream will said i got close as i dared theres eight of them men and women both no children i could see they put up a leanto against the rock the snows pretty well covered it now but i could still make it out no fire burning but the firepit was still plain as day no one moving i watched a long time no living man ever lay so still did you see any blood well no will admitted did you see any weapons some swords a few bows one man had an axe heavylooking doublebladed a cruel piece of iron it was on the ground beside him right by his hand did you make note of the position of the bodies will shrugged a couple are sitting up against the rock most of them on the ground fallen like or sleeping royce suggested fallen will insisted theres one woman up an ironwood halfhid in the branches a fareyes he smiled thinly i took care she never saw me when i got closer i saw that she wasnt moving neither despite himself he shivered you have a chill royce asked some will muttered the wind mlord the young knight turned back to his grizzled manatarms frostfallen leaves whispered past them and royces destrier moved restlessly what do you think might have killed these men gared ser waymar asked casually he adjusted the drape of his long sable cloak it was the cold gared said with iron certainty i saw men freeze last winter and the one before when i was half a boy everyone talks about snows forty foot deep and how the ice wind comes howling out of the north but the real enemy is the cold it steals up on you quieter than will and at first you shiver and your teeth chatter and you stamp your feet and dream of mulled wine and nice hot fires it burns it does nothing burns like the cold but only for a while then it gets inside you and starts to fill you up and after a while you dont have the strength to fight it its easier just to sit down or go to sleep they say you dont feel any pain toward the end first you go weak and drowsy and everything starts to fade and then its like sinking into a sea of warm milk peaceful like such eloquence gared ser waymar observed i never suspected you had it in you page ive had the cold in me too lordling gared pulled back his hood giving ser waymar a good long look at the stumps where his ears had been two ears three toes and the little finger off my left hand i got off light we found my brother frozen at his watch with a smile on his face ser waymar shrugged you ought dress more warmly gared gared glared at the lordling the scars around his ear holes flushed red with anger where maester aemon had cut the ears away well see how warm you can dress when the winter comes he pulled up his hood and hunched over his garron silent and sullen if gared said it was the cold will began have you drawn any watches this past week will yes mlord there never was a week when he did not draw a dozen bloody watches what was the man driving at and how did you find the wall weeping will said frowning he saw it clear enough now that the lordling had pointed it out they couldnt have froze not if the wall was weeping it wasnt cold enough royce nodded bright lad weve had a few light frosts this past week and a quick flurry of snow now and then but surely no cold fierce enough to kill eight grown men men clad in fur and leather let me remind you with shelter near at hand and the means of making fire the knights smile was cocksure will lead us there i would see these dead men for myself and then there was nothing to be done for it the order had been given and honor bound them to obey will went in front his shaggy little garron picking the way carefully through the undergrowth a light snow had fallen the night before and there were stones and roots and hidden sinks lying just under its crust waiting for the careless and the unwary ser waymar royce came next his great black destrier snorting impatiently the warhorse was the wrong mount for ranging but try and tell that to the lordling gared brought up the rear the old manatarms muttered to himself as he rode twilight deepened the cloudless sky turned a deep purple the color of an old bruise then faded to black the stars began to come out a halfmoon rose will was grateful for the light we can make a better pace than this surely royce said when the moon was full risen not with this horse will said fear had made him insolent perhaps my lord would care to take the lead ser waymar royce did not deign to reply somewhere off in the wood a wolf howled will pulled his garron over beneath an ancient gnarled ironwood and dismounted page why are you stopping ser waymar asked best go the rest of the way on foot mlord its just over that ridge royce paused a moment staring off into the distance his face reflective a cold wind whispered through the trees his great sable cloak stirred behind like something halfalive theres something wrong here gared muttered the young knight gave him a disdainful smile is there cant you feel it gared asked listen to the darkness will could feel it four years in the nights watch and he had never been so afraid what was it wind trees rustling a wolf which sound is it that unmans you so gared when gared did not answer royce slid gracefully from his saddle he tied the destrier securely to a lowhanging limb well away from the other horses and drew his longsword from its sheath jewels glittered in its hilt and the moonlight ran down the shining steel it was a splendid weapon castleforged and newmade from the look of it will doubted it had ever been swung in anger the trees press close here will warned that sword will tangle you up mord better a knife if i need instruction i will ask for it the young lord said gared stay here guard the horses gared dismounted we need a fire ill see to it how big a fool are you old man if there are enemies in this wood a fire is the last thing we want theres some enemies a fire will keep away gared said bears and direwolves and and other things ser waymars mouth became a hard line no fire gareds hood shadowed his face but will could see the hard glitter in his eyes as he stared at the knight for a moment he was afraid the older man would go for his sword it was a short ugly thing its grip discolored by sweat its edge nicked from hard use but will would not have given an iron bob for the lordlings life if gared pulled it from its scabbard finally gared looked down no fire he muttered low under his breath royce took it for acquiescence and turned away lead on he said to will will threaded their way through a thicket then started up the slope to the low ridge where he had found his vantage point under a sentinel tree under the thin crust of snow the ground was damp and muddy slick footing with rocks and hidden roots to trip you up will made no sound as he climbed behind him he heard the soft metallic slither of the lordlings ringmail the rustle of leaves and muttered curses as reaching branches grabbed at his longsword and tugged on his splendid sable cloak the great sentinel was right there at the top of the ridge where will had known it would be its lowest branches a bare foot off the ground will slid in underneath flat on his belly in the snow and the mud and page looked down on the empty clearing below his heart stopped in his chest for a moment he dared not breathe moonlight shone down on the clearing the ashes of the firepit the snowcovered leanto the great rock the little halffrozen stream everything was just as it had been a few hours ago they were gone all the bodies were gone gods he heard behind him a sword slashed at a branch as ser waymar royce gained the ridge he stood there beside the sentinel longsword in hand his cloak billowing behind him as the wind came up outlined nobly against the stars for all to see get down will whispered urgently somethings wrong royce did not move he looked down at the empty clearing and laughed your dead men seem to have moved camp will wills voice abandoned him he groped for words that did not come it was not possible his eyes swept back and forth over the abandoned campsite stopped on the axe a huge doublebladed battleaxe still lying where he had seen it last untouched a valuable weapon on your feet will ser waymar commanded theres no one here i wont have you hiding under a bush reluctantly will obeyed ser waymar looked him over with open disapproval i am not going back to castle black a failure on my first ranging we will find these men he glanced around up the tree be quick about it look for a fire will turned away wordless there was no use to argue the wind was moving it cut right through him he went to the tree a vaulting greygreen sentinel and began to climb soon his hands were sticky with sap and he was lost among the needles fear filled his gut like a meal he could not digest he whispered a prayer to the nameless gods of the wood and slipped his dirk free of its sheath he put it between his teeth to keep both hands free for climbing the taste of cold iron in his mouth gave him comfort down below the lordling called out suddenly who goes there will heard uncertainty in the challenge he stopped climbing he listened he watched the woods gave answer the rustle of leaves the icy rush of the stream a distant hoot of a snow owl the others made no sound will saw movement from the corner of his eye pale shapes gliding through the wood he turned his head glimpsed a white shadow in the darkness then it was gone branches stirred gently in the wind scratching at one another with wooden fingers will opened his mouth to call down a warning and the words seemed to freeze in his throat perhaps he was wrong perhaps it had only been a bird a reflection on the snow some trick of the moonlight what had he seen after all will where are you ser waymar called up can you see anything he was turning in a slow circle suddenly wary his sword in hand he must have felt them as will felt them there was nothing to see page answer me why is it so cold it was cold shivering will clung more tightly to his perch his face pressed hard against the trunk of the sentinel he could feel the sweet sticky sap on his cheek a shadow emerged from the dark of the wood it stood in front of royce tall it was and gaunt and hard as old bones with flesh pale as milk its armor seemed to change color as it moved here it was white as newfallen snow there black as shadow everywhere dappled with the deep greygreen of the trees the patterns ran like moonlight on water with every step it took will heard the breath go out of ser waymar royce in a long hiss come no farther the lordling warned his voice cracked like a boys he threw the long sable cloak back over his shoulders to free his arms for battle and took his sword in both hands the wind had stopped it was very cold the other slid forward on silent feet in its hand was a longsword like none that will had ever seen no human metal had gone into the forging of that blade it was alive with moonlight translucent a shard of crystal so thin that it seemed almost to vanish when seen edgeon there was a faint blue shimmer to the thing a ghostlight that played around its edges and somehow will knew it was sharper than any razor ser waymar met him bravely dance with me then he lifted his sword high over his head defiant his hands trembled from the weight of it or perhaps from the cold yet in that moment will thought he was a boy no longer but a man of the nights watch the other halted will saw its eyes blue deeper and bluer than any human eyes a blue that burned like ice they fixed on the longsword trembling on high watched the moonlight running cold along the metal for a heartbeat he dared to hope they emerged silently from the shadows twins to the first three of them four five ser waymar may have felt the cold that came with them but he never saw them never heard them will had to call out it was his duty and his death if he did he shivered and hugged the tree and kept the silence the pale sword came shivering through the air ser waymar met it with steel when the blades met there was no ring of metal on metal only a high thin sound at the edge of hearing like an animal screaming in pain royce checked a second blow and a third then fell back a step another flurry of blows and he fell back again behind him to right to left all around him the watchers stood patient faceless silent the shifting patterns of their delicate armor making them all but invisible in the wood yet they made no move to interfere again and again the swords met until will wanted to cover his ears against the strange anguished keening of their clash ser waymar was panting from the effort now his breath steaming in the moonlight his blade was white with frost the others danced with pale blue light then royces parry came a beat too late the pale sword bit through the ringmail beneath his arm the young lord cried out in pain blood welled between the rings it steamed in the cold and the droplets seemed red as fire where they touched the snow ser page waymars fingers brushed his side his moleskin glove came away soaked with red the other said something in a language that will did not know his voice was like the cracking of ice on a winter lake and the words were mocking ser waymar royce found his fury for robert he shouted and he came up snarling lifting the frostcovered longsword with both hands and swinging it around in a flat sidearm slash with all his weight behind it the others parry was almost lazy when the blades touched the steel shattered a scream echoed through the forest night and the longsword shivered into a hundred brittle pieces the shards scattering like a rain of needles royce went to his knees shrieking and covered his eyes blood welled between his fingers the watchers moved forward together as if some signal had been given swords rose and fell all in a deathly silence it was cold butchery the pale blades sliced through ringmail as if it were silk will closed his eyes far beneath him he heard their voices and laughter sharp as icicles when he found the courage to look again a long time had passed and the ridge below was empty he stayed in the tree scarce daring to breathe while the moon crept slowly across the black sky finally his muscles cramping and his fingers numb with cold he climbed down royces body lay facedown in the snow one arm outflung the thick sable cloak had been slashed in a dozen places lying dead like that you saw how young he was a boy he found what was left of the sword a few feet away the end splintered and twisted like a tree struck by lightning will knelt looked around warily and snatched it up the broken sword would be his proof gared would know what to make of it and if not him then surely that old bear mormont or maester aemon would gared still be waiting with the horses he had to hurry will rose ser waymar royce stood over him his fine clothes were a tatter his face a ruin a shard from his sword transfixed the blind white pupil of his left eye the right eye was open the pupil burned blue it saw the broken sword fell from nerveless fingers will closed his eyes to pray long elegant hands brushed his cheek then tightened around his throat they were gloved in the finest moleskin and sticky with blood yet the touch was icy cold bran the morning had dawned clear and cold with a crispness that hinted at the end of summer they set forth at daybreak to see a man beheaded twenty in all and bran rode among them nervous with excitement this was the first time he had been deemed old enough to go with his lord father and his page brothers to see the kings justice done it was the ninth year of summer and the seventh of brans life the man had been taken outside a small holdfast in the hills robb thought he was a wildling his sword sworn to mance rayder the kingbeyondthewall it made brans skin prickle to think of it he remembered the hearth tales old nan told them the wildlings were cruel men she said slavers and slayers and thieves they consorted with giants and ghouls stole girl children in the dead of night and drank blood from polished horns and their women lay with the others in the long night to sire terrible halfhuman children but the man they found bound hand and foot to the holdfast wall awaiting the kings justice was old and scrawny not much taller than robb he had lost both ears and a finger to frostbite and he dressed all in black the same as a brother of the nights watch except that his furs were ragged and greasy the breath of man and horse mingled steaming in the cold morning air as his lord father had the man cut down from the wall and dragged before them robb and jon sat tall and still on their horses with bran between them on his pony trying to seem older than seven trying to pretend that hed seen all this before a faint wind blew through the holdfast gate over their heads flapped the banner of the starks of winterfell a grey direwolf racing across an icewhite field brans father sat solemnly on his horse long brown hair stirring in the wind his closely trimmed beard was shot with white making him look older than his thirtyfive years he had a grim cast to his grey eyes this day and he seemed not at all the man who would sit before the fire in the evening and talk softly of the age of heroes and the children of the forest he had taken off fathers face bran thought and donned the face of lord stark of winterfell there were questions asked and answers given there in the chill of morning but afterward bran could not recall much of what had been said finally his lord father gave a command and two of his guardsmen dragged the ragged man to the ironwood stump in the center of the square they forced his head down onto the hard black wood lord eddard stark dismounted and his ward theon greyjoy brought forth the sword ice that sword was called it was as wide across as a mans hand and taller even than robb the blade was valyrian steel spellforged and dark as smoke nothing held an edge like valyrian steel his father peeled off his gloves and handed them to jory cassel the captain of his household guard he took hold of ice with both hands and said in the name of robert of the house baratheon the first of his name king of the andals and the rhoynar and the first men lord of the seven kingdoms and protector of the realm by the word of eddard of the house stark lord of winterfell and warden of the north i do sentence you to die he lifted the greatsword high above his head brans bastard brother jon snow moved closer keep the pony well in hand he whispered and dont look away father will know if you do bran kept his pony well in hand and did not look away his father took off the mans head with a single sure stroke blood sprayed out across the snow as red as surnmerwine one of the horses reared and had to be restrained to keep from bolting bran could not take his eyes off the blood the snows around the stump drank it eagerly reddening as he watched the head bounced off a thick root and rolled it came up near greyjoys feet theon was a lean dark page youth of nineteen who found everything amusing he laughed put his boot on the head and kicked it away ass jon muttered low enough so greyjoy did not hear he put a hand on brans shoulder and bran looked over at his bastard brother you did well jon told him solemnly jon was fourteen an old hand at justice it seemed colder on the long ride back to winterfell though the wind had died by then and the sun was higher in the sky bran rode with his brothers well ahead of the main party his pony struggling hard to keep up with their horses the deserter died bravely robb said he was big and broad and growing every day with his mothers coloring the fair skin redbrown hair and blue eyes of the tullys of riverrun he had courage at the least no jon snow said quietly it was not courage this one was dead of fear you could see it in his eyes stark jons eyes were a grey so dark they seemed almost black but there was little they did not see he was of an age with robb but they did not look alike jon was slender where robb was muscular dark where robb was fair graceful and quick where his half brother was strong and fast robb was not impressed the others take his eyes he swore he died well race you to the bridge done jon said kicking his horse forward robb cursed and followed and they galloped off down the trail robb laughing and hooting jon silent and intent the hooves of their horses kicked up showers of snow as they went bran did not try to follow his pony could not keep up he had seen the ragged mans eyes and he was thinking of them now after a while the sound of robbs laughter receded and the woods grew silent again so deep in thought was he that he never heard the rest of the party until his father moved up to ride beside him are you well bran he asked not unkindly yes father bran told him he looked up wrapped in his furs and leathers mounted on his great warhorse his lord father loomed over him like a giant robb says the man died bravely but jon says he was afraid what do you think his father asked bran thought about it can a man still be brave if hes afraid that is the only time a man can be brave his father told him do you understand why i did it he was a wildling bran said they carry off women and sell them to the others his lord father smiled old nan has been telling you stories again in truth the man was an oathbreaker a deserter from the nights watch no man is more dangerous the deserter knows his life is forfeit if he is taken so he will not flinch from any crime no matter how vile but you mistake me the question was not why the man had to die but why i must do it page bran had no answer for that king robert has a headsman he said uncertainly he does his father admitted as did the targaryen kings before him yet our way is the older way the blood of the first men still flows in the veins of the starks and we hold to the belief that the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword if you would take a mans life you owe it to him to look into his eyes and hear his final words and if you cannot bear to do that then perhaps the man does not deserve to die one day bran you will be robbs bannerman holding a keep of your own for your brother and your king and justice will fall to you when that day comes you must take no pleasure in the task but neither must you look away a ruler who hides behind paid executioners soon forgets what death is that was when jon reappeared on the crest of the hill before them he waved and shouted down at them father bran come quickly see what robb has found then he was gone again jory rode up beside them trouble my lord beyond a doubt his lord father said come let us see what mischief my sons have rooted out now he sent his horse into a trot jory and bran and the rest came after they found robb on the riverbank north of the bridge with jon still mounted beside him the late summer snows had been heavy this moonturn robb stood kneedeep in white his hood pulled back so the sun shone in his hair he was cradling something in his arm while the boys talked in hushed excited voices the riders picked their way carefully through the drifts groping for solid footing on the hidden uneven ground jory cassel and theon greyjoy were the first to reach the boys greyjoy was laughing and joking as he rode bran heard the breath go out of him gods he exclaimed struggling to keep control of his horse as he reached for his sword jorys sword was already out robb get away from it he called as his horse reared under him robb grinned and looked up from the bundle in his arms she cant hurt you he said shes dead jory bran was afire with curiosity by then he would have spurred the pony faster but his father made them dismount beside the bridge and approach on foot bran jumped off and ran by then jon jory and theon greyjoy had all dismounted as well what in the seven hells is it greyjoy was saying a wolf robb told him a freak greyjoy said look at the size of it brans heart was thumping in his chest as he pushed through a waisthigh drift to his brothers side halfburied in bloodstained snow a huge dark shape slumped in death ice had formed in its shaggy grey fur and the faint smell of corruption clung to it like a womans perfume bran glimpsed blind eyes crawling with maggots a wide mouth full of yellowed teeth but it was the size of it that made him gasp it was bigger than his pony twice the size of the largest hound in his fathers kennel page its no freak jon said calmly thats a direwolf they grow larger than the other kind theon greyjoy said theres not been a direwolf sighted south of the wall in two hundred years i see one now jon replied bran tore his eyes away from the monster that was when he noticed the bundle in robbs arms he gave a cry of delight and moved closer the pup was a tiny ball of greyblack fur its eyes still closed it nuzzled blindly against robbs chest as he cradled it searching for milk among his leathers making a sad little whimpery sound bran reached out hesitantly go on robb told him you can touch him bran gave the pup a quick nervous stroke then turned as jon said here you go his half brother put a second pup into his arms there are five of them bran sat down in the snow and hugged the wolf pup to his face its fur was soft and warm against his cheek direwolves loose in the realm after so many years muttered hullen the master of horse i like it not it is a sign jory said father frowned this is only a dead animal jory he said yet he seemed troubled snow crunched under his boots as he moved around the body do we know what killed her theres something in the throat robb told him proud to have found the answer before his father even asked there just under the jaw his father knelt and groped under the beasts head with his hand he gave a yank and held it up for all to see a foot of shattered antler tines snapped off all wet with blood a sudden silence descended over the party the men looked at the antler uneasily and no one dared to speak even bran could sense their fear though he did not understand his father tossed the antler to the side and cleansed his hands in the snow im surprised she lived long enough to whelp he said his voice broke the spell maybe she didnt jory said ive heard tales maybe the bitch was already dead when the pups came born with the dead another man put in worse luck no matter said hullen they be dead soon enough too bran gave a wordless cry of dismay the sooner the better theon greyjoy agreed he drew his sword give the beast here bran the little thing squirmed against him as if it heard and understood no bran cried out fiercely its mine page put away your sword greyjoy robb said for a moment he sounded as commanding as their father like the lord he would someday be we will keep these pups you cannot do that boy said harwin who was hullens son it be a mercy to kill them hullen said bran looked to his lord father for rescue but got only a frown a furrowed brow hullen speaks truly son better a swift death than a hard one from cold and starvation no he could feel tears welling in his eyes and he looked away he did not want to cry in front of his father robb resisted stubbornly ser rodriks red bitch whelped again last week he said it was a small litter only two live pups shell have milk enough shell rip them apart when they try to nurse lord stark jon said it was strange to hear him call father that so formal bran looked at him with desperate hope there are five pups he told father three male two female what of it jon you have five trueborn children jon said three sons two daughters the direwolf is the sigil of your house your children were meant to have these pups my lord bran saw his fathers face change saw the other men exchange glances he loved jon with all his heart at that moment even at seven bran understood what his brother had done the count had come right only because jon had omitted himself he had included the girls included even rickon the baby but not the bastard who bore the surname snow the name that custom decreed be given to all those in the north unlucky enough to be born with no name of their own their father understood as well you want no pup for yourself jon he asked softly the direwolf graces the banners of house stark jon pointed out i am no stark father their lord father regarded jon thoughtfully robb rushed into the silence he left i will nurse him myself father he promised i will soak a towel with warm milk and give him suck from that me too bran echoed the lord weighed his sons long and carefully with his eyes easy to say and harder to do i will not have you wasting the servants time with this if you want these pups you will feed them yourselves is that understood bran nodded eagerly the pup squirmed in his grasp licked at his face with a warm tongue you must train them as well their father said you must train them the kennelmaster will have nothing to do with these monsters i promise you that and the gods help you if you neglect them or brutalize them or train them badly these are not dogs to beg for treats and slink off at a kick a direwolf will rip page a mans arm off his shoulder as easily as a dog will kill a rat are you sure you want this yes father bran said yes robb agreed the pups may die anyway despite all you do they wont die robb said we wont let them die keep them then jory desmond gather up the other pups its time we were back to winterfell it was not until they were mounted and on their way that bran allowed himself to taste the sweet air of victory by then his pup was snuggled inside his leathers warm against him safe for the long ride home bran was wondering what to name him halfway across the bridge jon pulled up suddenly what is it jon their lord father asked cant you hear it bran could hear the wind in the trees the clatter of their hooves on the ironwood planks the whimpering of his hungry pup but jon was listening to something else there jon said he swung his horse around and galloped back across the bridge they watched him dismount where the direwolf lay dead in the snow watched him kneel a moment later he was riding back to them smiling he must have crawled away from the others jon said or been driven away their father said looking at the sixth pup his fur was white where the rest of the litter was grey his eyes were as red as the blood of the ragged man who had died that morning bran thought it curious that this pup alone would have opened his eyes while the others were still blind an albino theon greyjoy said with wry amusement this one will die even faster than the others jon snow gave his fathers ward a long chilling look i think not greyjoy he said this one belongs to me catelyn catelyn had never liked this godswood she had been born a tully at riverrun far to the south on the red fork of the trident the godswood there was a garden bright and airy where tall redwoods spread dappled shadows across tinkling streams birds sang from hidden nests and the air was spicy with the scent of flowers page the gods of winterfell kept a different sort of wood it was a dark primal place three acres of old forest untouched for ten thousand years as the gloomy castle rose around it it smelled of moist earth and decay no redwoods grew here this was a wood of stubborn sentinel trees armored in greygreen needles of mighty oaks of ironwoods as old as the realm itself here thick black trunks crowded close together while twisted branches wove a dense canopy overhead and misshappen roots wrestled beneath the soil this was a place of deep silence and brooding shadows and the gods who lived here had no names but she knew she would find her husband here tonight whenever he took a mans life afterward he would seek the quiet of the godswood catelyn had been anointed with the seven oils and named in the rainbow of light that filled the sept of riverrun she was of the faith like her father and grandfather and his father before him her gods had names and their faces were as familiar as the faces of her parents worship was a septon with a censer the smell of incense a sevensided crystal alive with light voices raised in song the tullys kept a godswood as all the great houses did but it was only a place to walk or read or lie in the sun worship was for the sept for her sake ned had built a small sept where she might sing to the seven faces of god but the blood of the first men still flowed in the veins of the starks and his own gods were the old ones the nameless faceless gods of the greenwood they shared with the vanished children of the forest at the center of the grove an ancient weirwood brooded over a small pool where the waters were black and cold the heart tree ned called it the weirwoods bark was white as bone its leaves dark red like a thousand bloodstained hands a face had been carved in the trunk of the great tree its features long and melancholy the deepcut eyes red with dried sap and strangely watchful they were old those eyes older than winterfell itself they had seen brandon the builder set the first stone if the tales were true they had watched the castles granite walls rise around them it was said that the children of the forest had carved the faces in the trees during the dawn centuries before the coming of the first men across the narrow sea in the south the last weirwoods had been cut down or burned out a thousand years ago except on the isle of faces where the green men kept their silent watch up here it was different here every castle had its godswood and every godswood had its heart tree and every heart tree its face catelyn found her husband beneath the weirwood seated on a mosscovered stone the greatsword ice was across his lap and he was cleaning the blade in those waters black as night a thousand years of humus lay thick upon the godswood floor swallowing the sound of her feet but the red eyes of the weirwood seemed to follow her as she came ned she called softly he lifted his head to look at her catelyn he said his voice was distant and formal where are the children he would always ask her that in the kitchen arguing about names for the wolf pups she spread her cloak on the forest floor and sat beside the pool her back to the weirwood she could feel the eyes watching her but she did her best to ignore them arya is already in love and sansa is charmed and gracious but rickon is not quite sure is he afraid ned asked page a little she admitted he is only three ned frowned he must learn to face his fears he will not be three forever and winter is coming yes catelyn agreed the words gave her a chill as they always did the stark words every noble house had its words family mottoes touchstones prayers of sorts they boasted of honor and glory promised loyalty and truth swore faith and courage all but the starks winter is coming said the stark words not for the first time she reflected on what a strange people these northerners were the man died well ill give him that ned said he had a swatch of oiled leather in one hand he ran it lightly up the greatsword as he spoke polishing the metal to a dark glow i was glad for brans sake you would have been proud of bran i am always proud of bran catelyn replied watching the sword as he stroked it she could see the rippling deep within the steel where the metal had been folded back on itself a hundred times in the forging catelyn had no love for swords but she could not deny that ice had its own beauty it had been forged in valyria before the doom had come to the old freehold when the ironsmiths had worked their metal with spells as well as hammers four hundred years old it was and as sharp as the day it was forged the name it bore was older still a legacy from the age of heroes when the starks were kings in the north he was the fourth this year ned said grimly the poor man was halfmad something had put a fear in him so deep that my words could not reach him he sighed ben writes that the strength of the nights watch is down below a thousand its not only desertions they are losing men on rangings as well is it the wildlings she asked who else ned lifted ice looked down the cool steel length of it and it will only grow worse the day may come when i will have no choice but to call the banners and ride north to deal with this kingbeyondthewall for good and all beyond the wall the thought made catelyn shudder ned saw the dread on her face mance rayder is nothing for us to fear there are darker things beyond the wall she glanced behind her at the heart tree the pale bark and red eyes watching listening thinking its long slow thoughts his smile was gentle you listen to too many of old nans stories the others are as dead as the children of the forest gone eight thousand years maester luwin will tell you they never lived at all no living man has ever seen one until this morning no living man had ever seen a direwolf either catelyn reminded him i ought to know better than to argue with a tully he said with a rueful smile he slid ice back into its sheath you did not come here to tell me crib tales i know how little you like this place what is it my lady catelyn took her husbands hand there was grievous news today my lord i did not wish to trouble you until you had cleansed yourself there was no way to soften the blow so she told him straight i am page so sorry my love jon arryn is dead his eyes found hers and she could see how hard it took him as she had known it would in his youth ned had fostered at the eyrie and the childless lord arryn had become a second father to him and his fellow ward robert baratheon when the mad king aerys targaryen had demanded their heads the lord of the eyrie had raised his moonandfalcon banners in revolt rather than give up those he had pledged to protect and one day fifteen years ago this second father had become a brother as well as he and ned stood together in the sept at riverrun to wed two sisters the daughters of lord hoster tully jon he said is this news certain it was the kings seal and the letter is in roberts own hand i saved it for you he said lord arryn was taken quickly even maester pycelle was helpless but he brought the milk of the poppy so jon did not linger long in pain that is some small mercy i suppose he said she could see the grief on his face but even then he thought first of her your sister he said and jons boy what word of them the message said only that they were well and had returned to the eyrie catelyn said i wish they had gone to riverrun instead the eyrie is high and lonely and it was ever her husbands place not hers lord jons memory will haunt each stone i know my sister she needs the comfort of family and friends around her your uncle waits in the vale does he not jon named him knight of the gate id heard catelyn nodded brynden will do what he can for her and for the boy that is some comfort but still go to her ned urged take the children fill her halls with noise and shouts and laughter that boy of hers needs other children about him and lysa should not be alone in her grief would that i could catelyn said the letter had other tidings the king is riding to winterfell to seek you out it took ned a moment to comprehend her words but when the understanding came the darkness left his eyes robert is coming here when she nodded a smile broke across his face catelyn wished she could share his joy but she had heard the talk in the yards a direwolf dead in the snow a broken antler in its throat dread coiled within her like a snake but she forced herself to smile at this man she loved this man who put no faith in signs i knew that would please you she said we should send word to your brother on the wall yes of course he agreed ben will want to be here i shall tell maester luwin to send his swiftest bird ned rose and pulled her to her feet damnation how many years has it been and he gives us no more notice than this how many in his party did the message say i should think a hundred knights at the least with all their retainers and half again as many freeriders page cersei and the children travel with them robert will keep an easy pace for their sakes he said it is just as well that will give us more time to prepare the queens brothers are also in the party she told him ned grimaced at that there was small love between him and the queens family catelyn knew the lannisters of casterly rock had come late to roberts cause when victory was all but certain and he had never forgiven them well if the price for roberts company is an infestation of lannisters so be it it sounds as though robert is bringing half his court where the king goes the realm follows she said it will be good to see the children the youngest was still sucking at the lannister womans teat the last time i saw him he must be what five by now prince tornmen is seven she told him the same age as bran please ned guard your tongue the lannister woman is our queen and her pride is said to grow with every passing year ned squeezed her hand there must be a feast of course with singers and robert will want to hunt i shall send jory south with an honor guard to meet them on the kingsroad and escort them back gods how are we going to feed them all on his way already you said damn the man damn his royal hide daenerys her brother held the gown up for her inspection this is beauty touch it go on caress the fabric dany touched it the cloth was so smooth that it seemed to run through her fingers like water she could not remember ever wearing anything so soft it frightened her she pulled her hand away is it really mine a gift from the magister illyrio viserys said smiling her brother was in a high mood tonight the color will bring out the violet in your eyes and you shall have gold as well and jewels of all sorts illyrio has promised tonight you must look like a princess a princess dany thought she had forgotten what that was like perhaps she had never really known why does he give us so much she asked what does he want from us for nigh on half a year they had lived in the magisters house eating his food pampered by his servants dany was thirteen old enough to know that such gifts seldom come without their price here in the free city of pentos illyrio is no fool viserys said he was a gaunt young man with nervous hands and a feverish look in his pale lilac eyes the magister knows that i will not forget my friends when i come into my throne dany said nothing magister illyrio was a dealer in spices gemstones dragonbone and other less savory things he had friends in all of the nine free cities it was said and even beyond in vaes dothrak and the fabled lands beside the jade sea it was also said that hed never had a friend he wouldnt page cheerfully sell for the right price dany listened to the talk in the streets and she heard these things but she knew better than to question her brother when he wove his webs of dream his anger was a terrible thing when roused viserys called it waking the dragon her brother hung the gown beside the door illyrio will send the slaves to bathe you be sure you wash off the stink of the stables khal drogo has a thousand horses tonight he looks for a different sort of mount he studied her critically you still slouch straighten yourself he pushed back her shoulders with his hands let them see that you have a womans shape now his fingers brushed lightly over her budding breasts and tightened on a nipple you will not fail me tonight if you do it will go hard for you you dont want to wake the dragon do you his fingers twisted her the pinch cruelly hard through the rough fabric of her tunic do you he repeated no dany said meekly her brother smiled good he touched her hair almost with affection when they write the history of my reign sweet sister they will say that it began tonight when he was gone dany went to her window and looked out wistfully on the waters of the bay the square brick towers of pentos were black silhouettes outlined against the setting sun dany could hear the singing of the red priests as they lit their night fires and the shouts of ragged children playing games beyond the walls of the estate for a moment she wished she could be out there with them barefoot and breathless and dressed in tatters with no past and no future and no feast to attend at khal drogos manse somewhere beyond the sunset across the narrow sea lay a land of green hills and flowered plains and great rushing rivers where towers of dark stone rose amidst magnificent bluegrey mountains and armored knights rode to battle beneath the banners of their lords the dothraki called that land rhaesh andahli the land of the andals in the free cities they talked of westeros and the sunset kingdoms her brother had a simpler name our land he called it the words were like a prayer with him if he said them enough the gods were sure to hear ours by blood right taken from us by treachery but ours still ours forever you do not steal from the dragon oh no the dragon remembers and perhaps the dragon did remember but dany could not she had never seen this land her brother said was theirs this realm beyond the narrow sea these places he talked of casterly rock and the eyrie highgarden and the vale of arryn dorne and the isle of faces they were just words to her viserys had been a boy of eight when they fled kings landing to escape the advancing armies of the usurper but daenerys had been only a quickening in their mothers womb yet sometimes dany would picture the way it had been so often had her brother told her the stories the midnight flight to dragonstone moonlight shimmering on the ships black sails her brother rhaegar battling the usurper in the bloody waters of the trident and dying for the woman he loved the sack of kings landing by the ones viserys called the usurpers dogs the lords lannister and stark princess elia of dorne pleading for mercy as rhaegars heir was ripped from her breast and murdered before her eyes the polished skulls of the last dragons staring down sightlessly from the walls of the throne room while the kingslayer opened fathers throat with a golden sword she had been born on dragonstone nine moons after their flight while a raging summer storm threatened to rip the island fastness apart they said that storm was terrible the targaryen fleet was smashed while it lay at anchor and huge stone blocks were ripped from the parapets and sent hurtling into the wild waters of the narrow sea her mother had died birthing her and for that her brother viserys had never page forgiven her she did not remember dragonstone either they had run again just before the usurpers brother set sail with his newbuilt fleet by then only dragonstone itself the ancient seat of their house had remained of the seven kingdoms that had once been theirs it would not remain for long the garrison had been prepared to sell them to the usurper but one night ser willem darry and four loyal men had broken into the nursery and stolen them both along with her wet nurse and set sail under cover of darkness for the safety of the braavosian coast she remembered ser willem dimly a great grey bear of a man halfblind roaring and bellowing orders from his sickbed the servants had lived in terror of him but he had always been kind to dany he called her little princess and sometimes my lady and his hands were soft as old leather he never left his bed though and the smell of sickness clung to him day and night a hot moist sickly sweet odor that was when they lived in braavos in the big house with the red door dany had her own room there with a lemon tree outside her window after ser willem had died the servants had stolen what little money they had left and soon after they had been put out of the big house dany had cried when the red door closed behind them forever they had wandered since then from braavos to myr from myr to tyrosh and on to qohor and volantis and lys never staying long in any one place her brother would not allow it the usurpers hired knives were close behind them he insisted though dany had never seen one at first the magisters and archons and merchant princes were pleased to welcome the last targaryens to their homes and tables but as the years passed and the usurper continued to sit upon the iron throne doors closed and their lives grew meaner years past they had been forced to sell their last few treasures and now even the coin they had gotten from mothers crown had gone in the alleys and wine sinks of pentos they called her brother the beggar king dany did not want to know what they called her we will have it all back someday sweet sister he would promise her sometimes his hands shook when he talked about it the jewels and the silks dragonstone and kings landing the iron throne and the seven kingdoms all they have taken from us we will have it back viserys lived for that day all that daenerys wanted back was the big house with the red door the lemon tree outside her window the childhood she had never known there came a soft knock on her door come dany said turning away from the window illyrios servants entered bowed and set about their business they were slaves a gift from one of the magisters many dothraki friends there was no slavery in the free city of pentos nonetheless they were slaves the old woman small and grey as a mouse never said a word but the girl made up for it she was illyrios favorite a fairhaired blueeyed wench of sixteen who chattered constantly as she worked they filled her bath with hot water brought up from the kitchen and scented it with fragrant oils the girl pulled the rough cotton tunic over danys head and helped her into the tub the water was scalding hot but daenerys did not flinch or cry out she liked the heat it made her feel clean besides her brother had often told her that it was never too hot for a targaryen ours is the house of the dragon he would say the fire is in our blood the old woman washed her long silverpale hair and gently combed out the snags all in silence the girl scrubbed her back and her feet and told her how lucky she was drogo is so rich that even his slaves page wear golden collars a hundred thousand men ride in his khalasar and his palace in vaes dothrak has two hundred rooms and doors of solid silver there was more like that so much more what a handsome man the khal was so tall and fierce fearless in battle the best rider ever to mount a horse a demon archer daenerys said nothing she had always assumed that she would wed viserys when she came of age for centuries the targaryens had married brother to sister since aegon the conqueror had taken his sisters to bride the line must be kept pure viserys had told her a thousand times theirs was the kingsblood the golden blood of old valyria the blood of the dragon dragons did not mate with the beasts of the field and targaryens did not mingle their blood with that of lesser men yet now viserys schemed to sell her to a stranger a barbarian when she was clean the slaves helped her from the water and toweled her dry the girl brushed her hair until it shone like molten silver while the old woman anointed her with the spiceflower perfume of the dothraki plains a dab on each wrist behind her ears on the tips of her breasts and one last one cool on her lips down there between her legs they dressed her in the wisps that magister illyrio had sent up and then the gown a deep plum silk to bring out the violet in her eyes the girl slid the gilded sandals onto her feet while the old woman fixed the tiara in her hair and slid golden bracelets crusted with amethysts around her wrists last of all came the collar a heavy golden tore emblazoned with ancient valyrian glyphs now you look all a princess the girl said breathlessly when they were done dany glanced at her image in the silvered looking glass that illyrio had so thoughtfully provided a princess she thought but she remembered what the girl had said how khal drogo was so rich even his slaves wore golden collars she felt a sudden chill and gooseflesh pimpled her bare arms her brother was waiting in the cool of the entry hall seated on the edge of the pool his hand trailing in the water he rose when she appeared and looked her over critically stand there he told her turn around yes good you look regal magister illyrio said stepping through an archway he moved with surprising delicacy for such a massive man beneath loose garments of flamecolored silk rolls of fat jiggled as he walked gemstones glittered on every finger and his man had oiled his forked yellow beard until it shone like real gold may the lord of light shower you with blessings on this most fortunate day princess daenerys the magister said as he took her hand he bowed his head showing a thin glimpse of crooked yellow teeth through the gold of his beard she is a vision your grace a vision he told her brother drogo will be enraptured shes too skinny viserys said his hair the same silverblond as hers had been pulled back tightly behind his head and fastened with a dragonbone brooch it was a severe look that emphasized the hard gaunt lines of his face he rested his hand on the hilt of the sword that illyrio had lent him and said are you sure that khal drogo likes his women this young she has had her blood she is old enough for the khal illyrio told him not for the first time look at her that silvergold hair those purple eyes she is the blood of old valyria no doubt no doubt and highborn daughter of the old king sister to the new she cannot fail to entrance our drogo when he released her hand daenerys found herself trembling page i suppose her brother said doubtfully the savages have queer tastes boys horses sheep best not suggest this to khal drogo illyrio said anger flashed in her brothers lilac eyes do you take me for a fool the magister bowed slightly i take you for a king kings lack the caution of common men my apologies if i have given offense he turned away and clapped his hands for his bearers the streets of pentos were pitchdark when they set out in illyrios elaborately carved palanquin two servants went ahead to light their way carrying ornate oil lanterns with panes of pale blue glass while a dozen strong men hoisted the poles to their shoulders it was warm and close inside behind the curtains dany could smell the stench of illyrios pallid flesh through his heavy perfumes her brother sprawled out on his pillows beside her never noticed his mind was away across the narrow sea we wont need his whole khalasar viserys said his fingers toyed with the hilt of his borrowed blade though dany knew he had never used a sword in earnest ten thousand that would be enough i could sweep the seven kingdoms with ten thousand dothraki screamers the realm will rise for its rightful king tyrell redwyne darry greyjoy they have no more love for the usurper than i do the dornishmen burn to avenge elia and her children and the smallfolk will be with us they cry out for their king he looked at illyrio anxiously they do dont they they are your people and they love you well magister illyrio said amiably in holdfasts all across the realm men lift secret toasts to your health while women sew dragon banners and hide them against the day of your return from across the water he gave a massive shrug or so my agents tell me dany had no agents no way of knowing what anyone was doing or thinking across the narrow sea but she mistrusted illyrios sweet words as she mistrusted everything about illyrio her brother was nodding eagerly however i shall kill the usurper myself he promised who had never killed anyone as he killed my brother rhaegar and lannister too the kingslayer for what he did to my father that would be most fitting magister illyrio said dany saw the smallest hint of a smile playing around his full lips but her brother did not notice nodding he pushed back a curtain and stared off into the night and dany knew he was fighting the battle of the trident once again the ninetowered manse of khal drogo sat beside the waters of the bay its high brick walls overgrown with pale ivy it had been given to the khal by the magisters of pentos illyrio told them the free cities were always generous with the horselords it is not that we fear these barbarians illyrio would explain with a smile the lord of light would hold our city walls against a million dothraki or so the red priests promise yet why take chances when their friendship comes so cheap their palanquin was stopped at the gate the curtains pulled roughly back by one of the house guards he had the copper skin and dark almond eyes of a dothraki but his face was hairless and he wore the spiked bronze cap of the unsullied he looked them over coldly magister illyrio growled something to him in the rough dothraki tongue the guardsman replied in the same voice and waved them through the gates dany noticed that her brothers hand was clenched tightly around the hilt of his borrowed sword he page looked almost as frightened as she felt insolent eunuch viserys muttered as the palanquin lurched up toward the manse magister illyrios words were honey many important men will be at the feast tonight such men have enemies the khal must protect his guests yourself chief among them your grace no doubt the usurper would pay well for your head oh yes viserys said darkly he has tried illyrio i promise you that his hired knives follow us everywhere i am the last dragon and he will not sleep easy while i live the palanquin slowed and stopped the curtains were thrown back and a slave offered a hand to help daenerys out his collar she noted was ordinary bronze her brother followed one hand still clenched hard around his sword hilt it took two strong men to get magister illyrio back on his feet inside the manse the air was heavy with the scent of spices pinchfire and sweet lemon and cinnamon they were escorted across the entry hall where a mosaic of colored glass depicted the doom of valyria oil burned in black iron lanterns all along the walls beneath an arch of twining stone leaves a eunuch sang their coming viserys of the house targaryen the third of his name he called in a high sweet voice king of the andals and the rhoynar and the first men lord of the seven kingdoms and protector of the realm his sister daenerys stormborn princess of dragonstone his honorable host illyrio mopatis magister of the free city of pentos they stepped past the eunuch into a pillared courtyard overgrown in pale ivy moonlight painted the leaves in shades of bone and silver as the guests drifted among them many were dothraki horselords big men with redbrown skin their drooping mustachios bound in metal rings their black hair oiled and braided and hung with bells yet among them moved bravos and sellswords from pentos and myr and tyrosh a red priest even fatter than illyrio hairy men from the port of ibben and lords from the summer isles with skin as black as ebony daenerys looked at them all in wonder and realized with a sudden start of fear that she was the only woman there illyrio whispered to them those three are drogos bloodriders there he said by the pillar is khal moro with his son rhogoro the man with the green beard is brother to the archon of tyrosh and the man behind him is ser jorah mormont the last name caught daenerys a knight no less illyrio smiled through his beard anointed with the seven oils by the high septon himself what is he doing here she blurted the usurper wanted his head illyrio told them some trifling affront he sold some poachers to a tyroshi slaver instead of giving them to the nights watch absurd law a man should be able to do as he likes with his own chattel i shall wish to speak with ser jorah before the night is done her brother said dany found herself looking at the knight curiously he was an older man past forty and balding but still strong and fit instead of silks and cottons he wore wool and leather his tunic was a dark green embroidered with the likeness of a black bear standing on two legs she was still looking at this strange man from the homeland she had never known when magister illyrio page placed a moist hand on her bare shoulder over there sweet princess he whispered there is the khal himself dany wanted to run and hide but her brother was looking at her and if she displeased him she knew she would wake the dragon anxiously she turned and looked at the man viserys hoped would ask to wed her before the night was done the slave girl had not been far wrong she thought khal drogo was a head taller than the tallest man in the room yet somehow light on his feet as graceful as the panther in illyrios menagerie he was younger than shed thought no more than thirty his skin was the color of polished copper his thick mustachios bound with gold and bronze rings i must go and make my submissions magister illyrio said wait here i shall bring him to you her brother took her by the arm as illyrio waddled over to the khal his fingers squeezing so hard that they hurt do you see his braid sweet sister drogos braid was black as midnight and heavy with scented oil hung with tiny bells that rang softly as he moved it swung well past his belt below even his buttocks the end of it brushing against the back of his thighs you see how long it is viserys said when dothraki are defeated in combat they cut off their braids in disgrace so the world will know their shame khal drogo has never lost a fight he is aegon the dragonlord come again and you will be his queen dany looked at khal drogo his face was hard and cruel his eyes as cold and dark as onyx her brother hurt her sometimes when she woke the dragon but he did not frighten her the way this man frightened her i dont want to be his queen she heard herself say in a small thin voice please please viserys i dont want to i want to go home home he kept his voice low but she could hear the fury in his tone how are we to go home sweet sister they took our home from us he drew her into the shadows out of sight his fingers digging into her skin how are we to go home he repeated meaning kings landing and dragonstone and all the realm they had lost dany had only meant their rooms in illyrios estate no true home surely though all they had but her brother did not want to hear that there was no home there for him even the big house with the red door had not been home for him his fingers dug hard into her arm demanding an answer i dont know she said at last her voice breaking tears welled in her eyes i do he said sharply we go home with an army sweet sister with khal drogos army that is how we go home and if you must wed him and bed him for that you will he smiled at her id let his whole khalasar fuck you if need be sweet sister all forty thousand men and their horses too if that was what it took to get my army be grateful it is only drogo in time you may even learn to like him now dry your eyes illyrio is bringing him over and he will not see you crying dany turned and saw that it was true magister illyrio all smiles and bows was escorting khal drogo over to where they stood she brushed away unfallen tears with the back of her hand page smile viserys whispered nervously his hand failing to the hilt of his sword and stand up straight let him see that you have breasts gods know you have little enough as is daenerys smiled and stood up straight eddard the visitors poured through the castle gates in a river of gold and silver and polished steel three hundred strong a pride of bannermen and knights of sworn swords and freeriders over their heads a dozen golden banners whipped back and forth in the northern wind emblazoned with the crowned stag of baratheon ned knew many of the riders there came ser jaime lannister with hair as bright as beaten gold and there sandor clegane with his terrible burned face the tall boy beside him could only be the crown prince and that stunted little man behind them was surely the imp tyrion lannister yet the huge man at the head of the column flanked by two knights in the snowwhite cloaks of the kingsguard seemed almost a stranger to ned until he vaulted off the back of his warhorse with a familiar roar and crushed him in a bonecrunching hug ned ah but it is good to see that frozen face of yours the king looked him over top to bottom and laughed you have not changed at all would that ned had been able to say the same fifteen years past when they had ridden forth to win a throne the lord of storms end had been cleanshaven cleareyed and muscled like a maidens fantasy six and a half feet tall he towered over lesser men and when he donned his armor and the great antlered helmet of his house he became a veritable giant hed had a giants strength too his weapon of choice a spiked iron warhammer that ned could scarcely lift in those days the smell of leather and blood had clung to him like perfume now it was perfume that clung to him like perfume and he had a girth to match his height ned had last seen the king nine years before during balon greyjoys rebellion when the stag and the direwolf had joined to end the pretensions of the selfproclaimed king of the iron islands since the night they had stood side by side in greyjoys fallen stronghold where robert had accepted the rebel lords surrender and ned had taken his son theon as hostage and ward the king had gained at least eight stone a beard as coarse and black as iron wire covered his jaw to hide his double chin and the sag of the royal jowls but nothing could hide his stomach or the dark circles under his eyes yet robert was neds king now and not just a friend so he said only your grace winterfell is yours by then the others were dismounting as well and grooms were coming forward for their mounts roberts queen cersei lannister entered on foot with her younger children the wheelhouse in which they had ridden a huge doubledecked carriage of oiled oak and gilded metal pulled by forty heavy draft horses was too wide to pass through the castle gate ned knelt in the snow to kiss the queens ring while robert embraced catelyn like a longlost sister then the children had been brought forward introduced and approved of by both sides no sooner had those formalities of greeting been completed than the king had said to his host take me down to your crypt eddard i would pay my respects page ned loved him for that for remembering her still after all these years he called for a lantern no other words were needed the queen had begun to protest they had been riding since dawn everyone was tired and cold surely they should refresh themselves first the dead would wait she had said no more than that robert had looked at her and her twin brother jaime had taken her quietly by the arm and she had said no more they went down to the crypt together ned and this king he scarcely recognized the winding stone steps were narrow ned went first with the lantern i was starting to think we would never reach winterfell robert complained as they descended in the south the way they talk about my seven kingdoms a man forgets that your part is as big as the other six combined i trust you enjoyed the journey your grace robert snorted bogs and forests and fields and scarcely a decent inn north of the neck ive never seen such a vast emptiness where are all yourpeople likely they were too shy to come out ned jested he could feel the chill coming up the stairs a cold breath from deep within the earth kings are a rare sight in the north robert snorted more likely they were hiding under the snow snow ned the king put one hand on the wall to steady himself as they descended late summer snows are common enough ned said i hope they did not trouble you they are usually mild the others take your mild snows robert swore what will this place be like in winter i shudder to think the winters are hard ned admitted but the starks will endure we always have you need to come south robert told him you need a taste of summer before it flees in highgarden there are fields of golden roses that stretch away as far as the eye can see the fruits are so ripe they explode in your mouthmelons peaches fireplums youve never tasted such sweetness youll see i brought you some even at storms end with that good wind off the bay the days are so hot you can barely move and you ought to see the towns ned flowers everywhere the markets bursting with food the surnmerwines so cheap and so good that you can get drunk just breathing the air everyone is fat and drunk and rich he laughed and slapped his own ample stomach a thump and the girls ned he exclaimed his eyes sparkling i swear women lose all modesty in the heat they swim naked in the river right beneath the castle even in the streets its too damn hot for wool or fur so they go around in these short gowns silk if they have the silver and cotton if not but its all the same when they start sweating and the cloth sticks to their skin they might as well be naked the king laughed happily robert baratheon had always been a man of huge appetites a man who knew how to take his pleasures that was not a charge anyone could lay at the door of eddard stark yet ned could not help but notice that those pleasures were taking a toll on the king robert was breathing heavily by the time they reached the bottom of the stairs his face red in the lantern light as they stepped out into the darkness of the crypt your grace ned said respectfully he swept the lantern in a wide semicircle shadows moved and page lurched flickering light touched the stones underfoot and brushed against a long procession of granite pillars that marched ahead two by two into the dark between the pillars the dead sat on their stone thrones against the walls backs against the sepulchres that contained their mortal remains she is down at the end with father and brandon he led the way between the pillars and robert followed wordlessly shivering in the subterranean chill it was always cold down here their footsteps rang off the stones and echoed in the vault overhead as they walked among the dead of house stark the lords of winterfell watched them pass their likenesses were carved into the stones that sealed the tombs in long rows they sat blind eyes staring out into eternal darkness while great stone direwolves curled round their feet the shifting shadows made the stone figures seem to stir as the living passed by by ancient custom an iron longsword had been laid across the lap of each who had been lord of winterfell to keep the vengeful spirits in their crypts the oldest had long ago rusted away to nothing leaving only a few red stains where the metal had rested on stone ned wondered if that meant those ghosts were free to roam the castle now he hoped not the first lords of winterfell had been men hard as the land they ruled in the centuries before the dragonlords came over the sea they had sworn allegiance to no man styling themselves the kings in the north ned stopped at last and lifted the oil lantern the crypt continued on into darkness ahead of them but beyond this point the tombs were empty and unsealed black holes waiting for their dead waiting for him and his children ned did not like to think on that here he told his king robert nodded silently knelt and bowed his head there were three tombs side by side lord rickard stark neds father had a long stern face the stonemason had known him well he sat with quiet dignity stone fingers holding tight to the sword across his lap but in life all swords had failed him in two smaller sepulchres on either side were his children brandon had been twenty when he died strangled by order of the mad king aerys targaryen only a few short days before he was to wed catelyn tully of riverrun his father had been forced to watch him die he was the true heir the eldest born to rule lyanna had only been sixteen a childwoman of surpassing loveliness ned had loved her with all his heart robert had loved her even more she was to have been his bride she was more beautiful than that the king said after a silence his eyes lingered on lyannas face as if he could will her back to life finally he rose made awkward by his weight ah damn it ned did you have to bury her in a place like this his voice was hoarse with remembered grief she deserved more than darkness she was a stark of winterfell ned said quietly this is her place she should be on a hill somewhere under a fruit tree with the sun and clouds above her and the rain to wash her clean i was with her when she died ned reminded the king she wanted to come home to rest beside brandon and father he could hear her still at times promise me she had cried in a room that smelled of blood and roses promise me ned the fever had taken her strength and her voice had been faint as a page whisper but when he gave her his word the fear had gone out of his sisters eyes ned remembered the way she had smiled then how tightly her fingers had clutched his as she gave up her hold on life the rose petals spilling from her palm dead and black after that he remembered nothing they had found him still holding her body silent with grief the little crannogman howland reed had taken her hand from his ned could recall none of it i bring her flowers when i can he said lyanna was fond of flowers the king touched her cheek his fingers brushing across the rough stone as gently as if it were living flesh i vowed to kill rhaegar for what he did to her you did ned reminded him only once robert said bitterly they had come together at the ford of the trident while the battle crashed around them robert with his warhammer and his great antlered helm the targaryen prince armored all in black on his breastplate was the threeheaded dragon of his house wrought all in rubies that flashed like fire in the sunlight the waters of the trident ran red around the hooves of their destriers as they circled and clashed again and again until at last a crushing blow from roberts hammer stove in the dragon and the chest beneath it when ned had finally come on the scene rhaegar lay dead in the stream while men of both armies scrabbled in the swirling waters for rubies knocked free of his armor in my dreams i kill him every night robert admitted a thousand deaths will still be less than he deserves there was nothing ned could say to that after a quiet he said we should return your grace your wife will be waiting the others take my wife robert muttered sourly but he started back the way they had come his footsteps falling heavily and if i hear your grace once more ill have your head on a spike we are more to each other than that i had not forgotten ned replied quietly when the king did not answer he said tell me about jon robert shook his head i have never seen a man sicken so quickly we gave a tourney on my sons name day if you had seen jon then you would have sworn he would live forever a fortnight later he was dead the sickness was like a fire in his gut it burned right through him he paused beside a pillar before the tomb of a longdead stark i loved that old man we both did ned paused a moment catelyn fears for her sister how does lysa bear her grief roberts mouth gave a bitter twist not well in truth he admitted i think losing jon has driven the woman mad ned she has taken the boy back to the eyrie against my wishes i had hoped to foster him with tywin lannister at casterly rock jon had no brothers no other sons was i supposed to leave him to be raised by women ned would sooner entrust a child to a pit viper than to lord tywin but he left his doubts unspoken some old wounds never truly heal and bleed again at the slightest word the wife has lost the husband he said carefully perhapsthe mother feared to lose the son the boy is very young six and sickly and lord of the eyrie gods have mercy the king swore lord tywin had never taken a ward before lysa ought to have been honored the lannisters are a great and noble house she page refused to even hear of it then she left in the dead of night without so much as a byyourleave cersei was furious he sighed deeply the boy is my namesake did you know that robert arryn i am sworn to protect him how can i do that if his mother steals him away i will take him as ward if you wish ned said lysa should consent to that she and catelyn were close as girls and she would be welcome here as well a generous offer my friend the king said but too late lord tywin has already given his consent fostering the boy elsewhere would be a grievous affront to him i have more concern for my nephews welfare than i do for lannister pride ned declared that is because you do not sleep with a lannister robert laughed the sound rattling among the tombs and bouncing from the vaulted ceiling his smile was a flash of white teeth in the thicket of the huge black beard ah ned he said you are still too serious he put a massive arm around neds shoulders i had planned to wait a few days to speak to you but i see now theres no need for it come walk with me they started back down between the pillars blind stone eyes seemed to follow them as they passed the king kept his arm around neds shoulder you must have wondered why i finally came north to winterfell after so long ned had his suspicions but he did not give them voice for the joy of my company surely he said lightly and there is the wall you need to see it your grace to walk along its battlements and talk to those who man it the nights watch is a shadow of what it once was benjen says no doubt i will hear what your brother says soon enough robert said the wall has stood for what eight thousand years it can keep a few days more i have more pressing concerns these are difficult times i need good men about me men like jon arryn he served as lord of the eyrie as warden of the east as the hand of the king he will not be easy to replace his son ned began his son will succeed to the eyrie and all its incomes robert said brusquely no more that took ned by surprise he stopped startled and turned to look at his king the words came unbidden the arryns have always been wardens of the east the title goes with the domain perhaps when he comes of age the honor can be restored to him robert said i have this year to think of and next a sixyearold boy is no war leader ned in peace the title is only an honor let the boy keep it for his fathers sake if not his own surely you owe jon that much for his service the king was not pleased he took his arm from around neds shoulders jons service was the duty he owed his liege lord i am not ungrateful ned you of all men ought to know that but the son is not the father a mere boy cannot hold the east then his tone softened enough of this there is a more important office to discuss and i would not argue with you robert grasped ned by the elbow i have need of you ned i am yours to command your grace always they were words he had to say and so he said them page apprehensive about what might come next robert scarcely seemed to hear him those years we spent in the eyrie gods those were good years i want you at my side again ned i want you down in kings landing not up here at the end of the world where you are no damned use to anybody robert looked off into the darkness for a moment as melancholy as a stark i swear to you sitting a throne is a thousand times harder than winning one laws are a tedious business and counting coppers is worse and the people there is no end of them i sit on that damnable iron chair and listen to them complain until my mind is numb and my ass is raw they all want something money or land or justice the lies they tell and my lords and ladies are no better i am surrounded by flatterers and fools it can drive a man to madness ned half of them dont dare tell me the truth and the other half cant find it there are nights i wish we had lost at the trident ah no not truly but i understand ned said softly robert looked at him i think you do if so you are the only one my old friend he smiled lord eddard stark i would name you the hand of the king ned dropped to one knee the offer did not surprise him what other reason could robert have had for coming so far the hand of the king was the secondmost powerful man in the seven kingdoms he spoke with the kings voice commanded the kings armies drafted the kings laws at times he even sat upon the iron throne to dispense kings justice when the king was absent or sick or otherwise indisposed robert was offering him a responsibility as large as the realm itself it was the last thing in the world he wanted your grace he said i am not worthy of the honor robert groaned with goodhumored impatience if i wanted to honor you id let you retire i am planning to make you run the kingdom and fight the wars while i eat and drink and wench myself into an early grave he slapped his gut and grinned you know the saying about the king and his hand ned knew the saying what the king dreams he said the hand builds i bedded a fishmaid once who told me the lowborn have a choicer way to put it the king eats they say and the hand takes the shit he threw back his head and roared his laughter the echoes rang through the darkness and all around them the dead of winterfell seemed to watch with cold and disapproving eyes finally the laughter dwindled and stopped ned was still on one knee his eyes upraised damn it ned the king complained you might at least humor me with a smile they say it grows so cold up here in winter that a mans laughter freezes in his throat and chokes him to death ned said evenly perhaps that is why the starks have so little humor come south with me and ill teach you how to laugh again the king promised you helped me win this damnable throne now help me hold it we were meant to rule together if lyanna had lived we should have been brothers bound by blood as well as affection well it is not too late i have a son you have a daughter my joff and your sansa shall join our houses as page lyanna and i might once have done this offer did surprise him sansa is only eleven robert waved an impatient hand old enough for betrothal the marriage can wait a few years the king smiled now stand up and say yes curse you nothing would give me greater pleasure your grace ned answered he hesitated these honors are all so unexpected may i have some time to consider i need to tell my wife yes yes of course tell catelyn sleep on it if you must the king reached down clasped ned by the hand and pulled him roughly to his feet just dont keep me waiting too long i am not the most patient of men for a moment eddard stark was filled with a terrible sense of foreboding this was his place here in the north he looked at the stone figures all around them breathed deep in the chill silence of the crypt he could feel the eyes of the dead they were all listening he knew and winter was coming jon there were timesnot many but a fewwhen jon snow was glad he was a bastard as he filled his wine cup once more from a passing flagon it struck him that this might be one of them he settled back in his place on the bench among the younger squires and drank the sweet fruity taste of surnmerwine filled his mouth and brought a smile to his lips the great hall of winterfell was hazy with smoke and heavy with the smell of roasted meat and freshbaked bread its grey stone walls were draped with banners white gold crimson the direwolf of stark baratheons crowned stag the lion of lannister a singer was playing the high harp and reciting a ballad but down at this end of the hall his voice could scarcely be heard above the roar of the fire the clangor of pewter plates and cups and the low mutter of a hundred drunken conversations it was the fourth hour of the welcoming feast laid for the king jons brothers and sisters had been seated with the royal children beneath the raised platform where lord and lady stark hosted the king and queen in honor of the occasion his lord father would doubtless permit each child a glass of wine but no more than that down here on the benches there was no one to stop jon drinking as much as he had a thirst for and he was finding that he had a mans thirst to the raucous delight of the youths around him who urged him on every time he drained a glass they were fine company and jon relished the stories they were telling tales of battle and bedding and the hunt he was certain that his companions were more entertaining than the kings offspring he had sated his curiosity about the visitors when they made their entrance the procession had passed not a foot from the place he had been given on the bench and jon had gotten a good long look at them all his lord father had come first escorting the queen she was as beautiful as men said a jeweled tiara gleamed amidst her long golden hair its emeralds a perfect match for the green of her eyes his father helped her up the steps to the dais and led her to her seat but the queen never so much as looked at him even at fourteen jon could see through her smile page next had come king robert himself with lady stark on his arm the king was a great disappointment to jon his father had talked of him often the peerless robert baratheon demon of the trident the fiercest warrior of the realm a giant among princes jon saw only a fat man redfaced under his beard sweating through his silks he walked like a man half in his cups after them came the children little rickon first managing the long walk with all the dignity a threeyearold could muster jon had to urge him on when he stopped to visit close behind came robb in grey wool trimmed with white the stark colors he had the princess myrcella on his arm she was a wisp of a girl not quite eight her hair a cascade of golden curls under a jeweled net jon noticed the shy looks she gave robb as they passed between the tables and the timid way she smiled at him he decided she was insipid robb didnt even have the sense to realize how stupid she was he was grinning like a fool his half sisters escorted the royal princes arya was paired with plump young tommen whose whiteblond hair was longer than hers sansa two years older drew the crown prince joffrey baratheon he was twelve younger than jon or robb but taller than either to jons vast dismay prince joffrey had his sisters hair and his mothers deep green eyes a thick tangle of blond curls dripped down past his golden choker and high velvet collar sansa looked radiant as she walked beside him but jon did not like joffreys pouty lips or the bored disdainful way he looked at winterfells great hall he was more interested in the pair that came behind him the queens brothers the lannisters of casterly rock the lion and the imp there was no mistaking which was which ser jaime lannister was twin to queen cersei tall and golden with flashing green eyes and a smile that cut like a knife he wore crimson silk high black boots a black satin cloak on the breast of his tunic the lion of his house was embroidered in gold thread roaring its defiance they called him the lion of lannister to his face and whispered kingslayer behind his back jon found it hard to look away from him this is what a king should look like he thought to himself as the man passed then he saw the other one waddling along halfhidden by his brothers side tyrion lannister the youngest of lord tywins brood and by far the ugliest all that the gods had given to cersei and jaime they had denied tyrion he was a dwarf half his brothers height struggling to keep pace on stunted legs his head was too large for his body with a brutes squashedin face beneath a swollen shelf of brow one green eye and one black one peered out from under a lank fall of hair so blond it seemed white jon watched him with fascination the last of the high lords to enter were his uncle benjen stark of the nights watch and his fathers ward young theon greyjoy benjen gave jon a warm smile as he went by theon ignored him utterly but there was nothing new in that after all had been seated toasts were made thanks were given and returned and then the feasting began jon had started drinking then and he had not stopped something rubbed against his leg beneath the table jon saw red eyes staring up at him hungry again he asked there was still half a honeyed chicken in the center of the table jon reached out to tear off a leg then had a better idea he knifed the bird whole and let the carcass slide to the floor between his legs ghost ripped into it in savage silence his brothers and sisters had not been permitted to bring their wolves to the banquet but there were more curs than jon could count at this end of the hall and no one page had said a word about his pup he told himself he was fortunate in that too his eyes stung jon rubbed at them savagely cursing the smoke he swallowed another gulp of wine and watched his direwolf devour the chicken dogs moved between the tables trailing after the serving girls one of them a black mongrel bitch with long yellow eyes caught a scent of the chicken she stopped and edged under the bench to get a share jon watched the confrontation the bitch growled low in her throat and moved closer ghost looked up silent and fixed the dog with those hot red eyes the bitch snapped an angry challenge she was three times the size of the direwolf pup ghost did not move he stood over his prize and opened his mouth baring his fangs the bitch tensed barked again then thought better of this fight she turned and slunk away with one last defiant snap to save her pride ghost went back to his meal jon grinned and reached under the table to ruffle the shaggy white fur the direwolf looked up at him nipped gently at his hand then went back to eating is this one of the direwolves ive heard so much of a familiar voice asked close at hand jon looked up happily as his uncle ben put a hand on his head and ruffled his hair much as jon had ruffled the wolf s yes he said his name is ghost one of the squires interrupted the bawdy story hed been telling to make room at the table for their lords brother benjen stark straddled the bench withlong legs and took the wine cup out of jons hand summerwine he said after a taste nothing so sweet how many cups have you had jon jon smiled ben stark laughed as i feared ah well i believe i was younger than you the first time i got truly and sincerely drunk he snagged a roasted onion dripping brown with gravy from a nearby trencher and bit into it it crunched his uncle was sharpfeatured and gaunt as a mountain crag but there was always a hint of laughter in his bluegrey eyes he dressed in black as befitted a man of the nights watch tonight it was rich black velvet with high leather boots and a wide belt with a silver buckle a heavy silver chain was looped round his neck benjen watched ghost with amusement as he ate his onion a very quiet wolf he observed hes not like the others jon said he never makes a sound thats why i named him ghost that and because hes white the others are all dark grey or black there are still direwolves beyond the wall we hear them on our rangings benjen stark gave jon a long look dont you usually eat at table with your brothers most times jon answered in a flat voice but tonight lady stark thought it might give insult to the royal family to seat a bastard among them i see his uncle glanced over his shoulder at the raised table at the far end of the hall my brother does not seem very festive tonight page jon had noticed that too a bastard had to learn to notice things to read the truth that people hid behind their eyes his father was observing all the courtesies but there was tightness in him that jon had seldom seen before he said little looking out over the hall with hooded eyes seeing nothing two seats away the king had been drinking heavily all night his broad face was flushed behind his great black beard he made many a toast laughed loudly at every jest and attacked each dish like a starving man but beside him the queen seemed as cold as an ice sculpture the queen is angry too jon told his uncle in a low quiet voice father took the king down to the crypts this afternoon the queen didnt want him to go benjen gave jon a careful measuring look you dont miss much do you jon we could use a man like you on the wall jon swelled with pride robb is a stronger lance than i am but im the better sword and hullen says i sit a horse as well as anyone in the castle notable achievements take me with you when you go back to the wall jon said in a sudden rush father will give me leave to go if you ask him i know he will uncle benjen studied his face carefully the wall is a hard place for a boy jon i am almost a man grown jon protested i will turn fifteen on my next name day and maester luwin says bastards grow up faster than other children thats true enough benjen said with a downward twist of his mouth he took jons cup from the table filled it fresh from a nearby pitcher and drank down a long swallow daeren targaryen was only fourteen when he conquered dorne jon said the young dragon was one of his heroes a conquest that lasted a summer his uncle pointed out your boy king lost ten thousand men taking the place and another fifty trying to hold it someone should have told him that war isnt a game he took another sip of wine also he said wiping his mouth daeren targaryen was only eighteen when he died or have you forgotten that part i forget nothing jon boasted the wine was making him bold he tried to sit very straight to make himself seem taller i want to serve in the nights watch uncle he had thought on it long and hard lying abed at night while his brothers slept around him robb would someday inherit winterfell would command great armies as the warden of the north bran and rickon would be robbs bannermen and rule holdfasts in his name his sisters arya and sansa would marry the heirs of other great houses and go south as mistress of castles of their own but what place could a bastard hope to earn you dont know what youre asking jon the nights watch is a sworn brotherhood we have no families none of us will ever father sons our wife is duty our mistress is honor a bastard can have honor too jon said i am ready to swear your oath page you are a boy of fourteen benjen said not a man not yet until you have known a woman you cannot understand what you would be giving up i dont care about that jon said hotly you might if you knew what it meant benjen said if you knew what the oath would cost you you might be less eager to pay the price son jon felt anger rise inside him im not your son benjen stark stood up mores the pity he put a hand on jons shoulder come back to me after youve fathered a few bastards of your own and well see how you feel jon trembled i will never father a bastard he said carefully never he spat it out like venom suddenly he realized that the table had fallen silent and they were all looking at him he felt the tears begin to well behind his eyes he pushed himself to his feet i must be excused he said with the last of his dignity he whirled and bolted before they could see him cry he must have drunk more wine than he had realized his feet got tangled under him as he tried to leave and he lurched sideways into a serving girl and sent a flagon of spiced wine crashing to the floor laughter boomed all around him and jon felt hot tears on his cheeks someone tried to steady him he wrenched free of their grip and ran halfblind for the door ghost followed close at his heels out into the night the yard was quiet and empty a lone sentry stood high on the battlements of the inner wall his cloak pulled tight around him against the cold he looked bored and miserable as he huddled there alone but jon would have traded places with him in an instant otherwise the castle was dark and deserted jon had seen an abandoned holdfast once a drear place where nothing moved but the wind and the stones kept silent about whatever people had lived there winterfell reminded him of that tonight the sounds of music and song spilled through the open windows behind him they were the last things jon wanted to hear he wiped away his tears on the sleeve of his shirt furious that he had let them fall and turned to go boy a voice called out to him jon turned tyrion lannister was sitting on the ledge above the door to the great hall looking for all the world like a gargoyle the dwarf grinned down at him is that animal a wolf a direwolf jon said his name is ghost he stared up at the little man his disappointment suddenly forgotten what are you doing up there why arent you at the feast too hot too noisy and id drunk too much wine the dwarf told him i learned long ago that it is considered rude to vomit on your brother might i have a closer look at your wolf jon hesitated then nodded slowly can you climb down or shall i bring a ladder oh bleed that the little man said he pushed himself off the ledge into empty air jon gasped then page watched with awe as tyrion lannister spun around in a tight ball landed lightly on his hands then vaulted backward onto his legs ghost backed away from him uncertainly the dwarf dusted himself off and laughed i believe ive frightened your wolf my apologies hes not scared jon said he knelt and called out ghost come here come on thats it the wolf pup padded closer and nuzzled at jons face but he kept a wary eye on tyrion lannister and when the dwarf reached out to pet him he drew back and bared his fangs in a silent snarl shy isnt he lannister observed sit ghost jon commanded thats it keep still he looked up at the dwarf you can touch him now he wont move until i tell him to ive been training him i see lannister said he ruffled the snowwhite fur between ghosts ears and said nice wolf if i wasnt here hed tear out your throat jon said it wasnt actually true yet but it would be in that case you had best stay close the dwarf said he cocked his oversized head to one side and looked jon over with his mismatched eyes i am tyrion lannister i know jon said he rose standing he was taller than the dwarf it made him feel strange youre ned starks bastard arent you jon felt a coldness pass right through him he pressed his lips together and said nothing did i offend you lannister said sorry dwarfs dont have to be tactful generations of capering fools in motley have won me the right to dress badly and say any damn thing that comes into my head he grinned you are the bastard though lord eddard stark is my father jon admitted stiffly lannister studied his face yes he said i can see it you have more of the north in you than your brothers half brothers jon corrected he was pleased by the dwarf s comment but he tried not to let it show let me give you some counsel bastard lannister said never forget what you are for surely the world will not make it your strength then it can never be your weakness armor yourself in it and it will never be used to hurt you jon was in no mood for anyones counsel what do you know about being a bastard all dwarfs are bastards in their fathers eyes you are your mothers trueborn son of lannister am i the dwarf replied sardonic do tell my lord father my mother died birthing me and hes never page been sure i dont even know who my mother was jon said some woman no doubt most of them are he favored jon with a rueful grin remember this boy all dwarfs may be bastards yet not all bastards need be dwarfs and with that he turned and sauntered back into the feast whistling a tune when he opened the door the light from within threw his shadow clear across the yard and for just a moment tyrion lannister stood tall as a king catelyn f all the rooms in winterfells great keep catelyns bedchambers were the hottest she seldom had to light a fire the castle had been built over natural hot springs and the scalding waters rushed through its walls and chambers like blood through a mans body driving the chill from the stone halls filling the glass gardens with a moist warmth keeping the earth from freezing open pools smoked day and night in a dozen small courtyards that was a little thing in summer in winter it was the difference between life and death catelyns bath was always hot and steaming and her walls warm to the touch the warmth reminded her of riverrun of days in the sun with lysa and edmure but ned could never abide the heat the starks were made for the cold he would tell her and she would laugh and tell him in that case they had certainly built their castle in the wrong place so when they had finished ned rolled off and climbed from her bed as he had a thousand times before he crossed the room pulled back the heavy tapestries and threw open the high narrow windows one by one letting the night air into the chamber the wind swirled around him as he stood facing the dark naked and emptyhanded catelyn pulled the furs to her chin and watched him he looked somehow smaller and more vulnerable like the youth she had wed in the sept at riverrun fifteen long years gone her loins still ached from the urgency of his lovernaking it was a good ache she could feel his seed within her she prayed that it might quicken there it had been three years since rickon she was not too old she could give him another son i will refuse him ned said as he turned back to her his eyes were haunted his voice thick with doubt catelyn sat up in the bed you cannot you must not my duties are here in the north i have no wish to be roberts hand he will not understand that he is a king now and kings are not like other men if you refuse to serve him he will wonder why and sooner or later he will begin to suspect that you oppose him cant you see the danger that would put us in ned shook his head refusing to believe robert would never harm me or any of mine we were closer than brothers he loves me if i refuse him he will roar and curse and bluster and in a week we will laugh about it together i know the man page you knew the man she said the king is a stranger to you catelyn remembered the direwolf dead in the snow the broken antler lodged deep in her throat she had to make him see pride is everything to a king my lord robert came all this way to see you to bring you these great honors you cannot throw them back in his face honors ned laughed bitterly in his eyes yes she said and in yours and in mine she blazed angry now why couldnt he see he offers his own son in marriage to our daughter what else would you call that sansa might someday be queen her sons could rule from the wall to the mountains of dorne what is so wrong with that gods catelyn sansa is only eleven ned said and joffrey joffrey is she finished for him crown prince and heir to the iron throne and i was only twelve when my father promised me to your brother brandon that brought a bitter twist to neds mouth brandon yes brandon would know what to do he always did it was all meant for brandon you winterfell everything he was born to be a kings hand and a father to queens i never asked for this cup to pass to me perhaps not catelyn said but brandon is dead and the cup has passed and you must drink from it like it or not ned turned away from her back to the night he stood staring out in the darkness watching the moon and the stars perhaps or perhaps the sentries on the wall catelyn softened then to see his pain eddard stark had married her in brandons place as custom decreed but the shadow of his dead brother still lay between them as did the other the shadow of the woman he would not name the woman who had borne him his bastard son she was about to go to him when the knock came at the door loud and unexpected ned turned frowning what is it desmonds voice came through the door my lord maester luwin is without and begs urgent audience you told him i had left orders not to be disturbed yes my lord he insists very well send him in ned crossed to the wardrobe and slipped on a heavy robe catelyn realized suddenly how cold it had become she sat up in bed and pulled the furs to her chin perhaps we should close the windows she suggested page ned nodded absently maester luwin was shown in the maester was a small grey man his eyes were grey and quick and saw much his hair was grey what little the years had left him his robe was grey wool trimmed with white fur the stark colors its great floppy sleeves had pockets hidden inside luwin was always tucking things into those sleeves and producing other things from them books messages strange artifacts toys for the children with all he kept hidden in his sleeves catelyn was surprised that maester luwin could lift his arms at all the maester waited until the door had closed behind him before he spoke my lord he said to ned pardon for disturbing your rest i have been left a message ned looked irritated been left by whom has there been a rider i was not told there was no rider my lord only a carved wooden box left on a table in my observatory while i napped my servants saw no one but it must have been brought by someone in the kings party we have had no other visitors from the south a wooden box you say catelyn said inside was a fine new lens for the observatory from myr by the look of it the lenscrafters of myr are without equal ned frowned he had little patience for this sort of thing catelyn knew a lens he said what has that to do with me i asked the same question maester luwin said clearly there was more to this than the seeming under the heavy weight of her furs catelyn shivered a lens is an instrument to help us see indeed it is he fingered the collar of his order a heavy chain worn tight around the neck beneath his robe each link forged from a different metal catelyn could feel dread stirring inside her once again what is it that they would have us see more clearly the very thing i asked myself maester luwin drew a tightly rolled paper out of his sleeve i found the true message concealed within a false bottom when i dismantled the box the lens had come in but it is not for my eyes ned held out his hand let me have it then luwin did not stir pardons my lord the message is not for you either it is marked for the eyes of the lady catelyn and her alone may i approach catelyn nodded not trusting to speak the maester placed the paper on the table beside the bed it was sealed with a small blob of blue wax luwin bowed and began to retreat stay ned commanded him his voice was grave he looked at catelyn what is it my lady youre shaking im afraid she admitted she reached out and took the letter in trembling hands the furs dropped page away from her nakedness forgotten in the blue wax was the moonandfalcon seal of house arryn its from lysa catelyn looked at her husband it will not make us glad she told him there is grief in this message ned i can feel it ned frowned his face darkening open it catelyn broke the seal her eyes moved over the words at first they made no sense to her then she remembered lysa took no chances when we were girls together we had a private language she and l can you read it yes catelyn admitted then tell us perhaps i should withdraw maester luwin said no catelyn said we will need your counsel she threw back the furs and climbed from the bed the night air was as cold as the grave on her bare skin as she padded across the room maester luwin averted his eyes even ned looked shocked what are you doing he asked lighting a fire catelyn told him she found a dressing gown and shrugged into it then knelt over the cold hearth maester luwin ned began maester luwin has delivered all my children catelyn said this is no time for false modesty she slid the paper in among the kindling and placed the heavier logs on top of it ned crossed the room took her by the arm and pulled her to her feet he held her there his face inches from her my lady tell me what was this message catelyn stiffened in his grasp a warning she said softly if we have the wits to hear his eyes searched her face go on lysa says jon arryn was murdered his fingers tightened on her arm by whom the lannisters she told him the queen ned released his hold on her arm there were deep red marks on her skin gods he whispered his voice was hoarse your sister is sick with grief she cannot know what she is saying she knows catelyn said lysa is impulsive yes but this message was carefully planned cleverly hidden she knew it meant death if her letter fell into the wrong hands to risk so much she must have had more than mere suspicion catelyn looked to her husband now we truly have no choice you page must be roberts hand you must go south with him and learn the truth she saw at once that ned had reached a very different conclusion the only truths i know are here the south is a nest of adders i would do better to avoid luwin plucked at his chain collar where it had chafed the soft skin of his throat the hand of the king has great power my lord power to find the truth of lord arryns death to bring his killers to the kings justice power to protect lady arryn and her son if the worst be true ned glanced helplessly around the bedchamber catelyns heart went out to him but she knew she could not take him in her arms just then first the victory must be won for her childrens sake you say you love robert like a brother would you leave your brother surrounded by lannisters the others take both of you ned muttered darkly he turned away from them and went to the window she did not speak nor did the maester they waited quiet while eddard stark said a silent farewell to the home he loved when he turned away from the window at last his voice was tired and full of melancholy and moisture glittered faintly in the corners of his eyes my father went south once to answer the summons of a king he never came home again a different time maester luwin said a different king yes ned said dully he seated himself in a chair by the hearth catelyn you shall stay here in winterfell his words were like an icy draft through her heart no she said suddenly afraid was this to be her punishment never to see his face again nor to feel his arms around her yes ned said in words that would brook no argument you must govern the north in my stead while i run roberts errands there must always be a stark in winterfell robb is fourteen soon enough he will be a man grown he must learn to rule and i will not be here for him make him part of your councils he must be ready when his time comes gods will not for many years maester luwin murmured maester luwin i trust you as i would my own blood give my wife your voice in all things great and small teach my son the things he needs to know winter is coming maester luwin nodded gravely then silence fell until catelyn found her courage and asked the question whose answer she most dreaded what of the other children ned stood and took her in his arms and held her face close to his rickon is very young he said gently he should stay here with you and robb the others i would take with me i could not bear it catelyn said trembling you must he said sansa must wed joffrey that is clear now we must give them no grounds to suspect our devotion and it is past time that arya learned the ways of a southron court in a few years she will be of an age to marry too page sansa would shine in the south catelyn thought to herself and the gods knew that arya needed refinement reluctantly she let go of them in her heart but not bran never bran yes she said but please ned for the love you bear me let bran remain here at winterfell he is only seven i was eight when my father sent me to foster at the eyrie ned said ser rodrik tells me there is bad feeling between robb and prince joffrey that is not healthy bran can bridge that distance he is a sweet boy quick to laugh easy to love let him grow up with the young princes let him become their friend as robert became mine our house will be the safer for it he was right catelyn knew it it did not make the pain any easier to bear she would lose all four of them then ned and both girls and her sweet loving bran only robb and little rickon would be left to her she felt lonely already winterfell was such a vast place keep him off the walls then she said bravely you know how bran loves to climb ned kissed the tears from her eyes before they could fall thank you my lady he whispered this is hard i know what of jon snow my lord maester luwin asked catelyn tensed at the mention of the name ned felt the anger in her and pulled away many men fathered bastards catelyn had grown up with that knowledge it came as no surprise to her in the first year of her marriage to learn that ned had fathered a child on some girl chance met on campaign he had a mans needs after all and they had spent that year apart ned off at war in the south while she remained safe in her fathers castle at riverrun her thoughts were more of robb the infant at her breast than of the husband she scarcely knew he was welcome to whatever solace he might find between battles and if his seed quickened she expected he would see to the childs needs he did more than that the starks were not like other men ned brought his bastard home with him and called him son for all the north to see when the wars were over at last and catelyn rode to winterfell jon and his wet nurse had already taken up residence that cut deep ned would not speak of the mother not so much as a word but a castle has no secrets and catelyn heard her maids repeating tales they heard from the lips of her husbands soldiers they whispered of ser arthur dayne the sword of the morning deadliest of the seven knights of aeryss kingsguard and of how their young lord had slain him in single combat and they told how afterward ned had carried ser arthurs sword back to the beautiful young sister who awaited him in a castle called starfall on the shores of the summer sea the lady ashara dayne tall and fair with haunting violet eyes it had taken her a fortnight to marshal her courage but finally in bed one night catelyn had asked her husband the truth of it asked him to his face that was the only time in all their years that ned had ever frightened her never ask me about jon he said cold as ice he is my blood and that is all you need to know and now i will learn where you heard that name my lady she had pledged to obey she told him and from that day on the whispering had stopped and ashara daynes name was never heard in winterfell again whoever jons mother had been ned must have loved her fiercely for nothing catelyn said would persuade him to send the boy away it page was the one thing she could never forgive him she had come to love her husband with all her heart but she had never found it in her to love jon she might have overlooked a dozen bastards for neds sake so long as they were out of sight jon was never out of sight and as he grew he looked more like ned than any of the trueborn sons she bore him somehow that made it worse jon must go she said now he and robb are close ned said i had hoped he cannot stay here catelyn said cutting him off he is your son not mine i will not have him it was hard she knew but no less the truth ned would do the boy no kindness by leaving him here at winterfell the look ned gave her was anguished you know i cannot take him south there will be no place for him at court a boy with a bastards name you know what they will say of him he will be shunned catelyn armored her heart against the mute appeal in her husbands eyes they say your friend robert has fathered a dozen bastards himself and none of them has ever been seen at court ned blazed the lannister woman has seen to that how can you be so damnably cruel catelyn he is only a boy he his fury was on him he might have said more and worse but maester luwin cut in another solution presents itself he said his voice quiet your brother benjen came to me about jon a few days ago it seems the boy aspires to take the black ned looked shocked he asked to join the nights watch catelyn said nothing let ned work it out in his own mind her voice would not be welcome now yet gladly would she have kissed the maester just then his was the perfect solution benjen stark was a sworn brother jon would be a son to him the child he would never have and in time the boy would take the oath as well he would father no sons who might someday contest with catelyns own grandchildren for winterfell maester luwin said there is great honor in service on the wall my lord and even a bastard may rise high in the nights watch ned reflected still his voice was troubled jon is so young if he asked this when he was a man grown that would be one thing but a boy of fourteen a hard sacrifice maester luwin agreed yet these are hard times my lord his road is no crueler than yours or your ladys catelyn thought of the three children she must lose it was not easy keeping silent then ned turned away from them to gaze out the window his long face silent and thoughtful finally he sighed and turned back very well he said to maester luwin i suppose it is for the best i will speak to ben when shall we tell jon the maester asked when i must preparations must be made it will be a fortnight before we are ready to depart i would sooner let jon enjoy these last few days summer will end soon enough and childhood as well when the page time comes i will tell him myself arya a ryas stitches were crooked again she frowned down at them with dismay and glanced over to where her sister sansa sat among the other girls sansas needlework was exquisite everyone said so sansas work is as pretty as she is septa mordane told their lady mother once she has such fine delicate hands when lady catelyn had asked about arya the septa had sniffed arya has the hands of a blacksmith arya glanced furtively across the room worried that septa mordane might have read her thoughts but the septa was paying her no attention today she was sitting with the princess myrcella all smiles and admiration it was not often that the septa was privileged to instruct a royal princess in the womanly arts as she had said when the queen brought myrcella to join them arya thought that myrcellas stitches looked a little crooked too but you would never know it from the way septa mordane was cooing she studied her own work again looking for some way to salvage it then sighed and put down the needle she looked glumly at her sister sansa was chatting away happily as she worked beth cassel ser rodriks little girl was sitting by her feet listening to every word she said and jeyne poole was leaning over to whisper something in her ear what are you talking about arya asked suddenly jeyne gave her a startled look then giggled sansa looked abashed beth blushed no one answered tell me arya said jeyne glanced over to make certain that septa mordane was not listening myrcella said something then and the septa laughed along with the rest of the ladies we were talking about the prince sansa said her voice soft as a kiss arya knew which prince she meant jofftey of course the tall handsome one sansa got to sit with him at the feast arya had to sit with the little fat one naturally joffrey likes your sister jeyne whispered proud as if she had something to do with it she was the daughter of winterfells steward and sansas dearest friend he told her she was very beautiful hes going to marry her little beth said dreamily hugging herself then sansa will be queen of all the realm sansa had the grace to blush she blushed prettily she did everything prettily arya thought with dull resentment beth you shouldnt make up stories sansa corrected the younger girl gently stroking her hair to take the harshness out of her words she looked at arya what did you think of prince joff sister hes very gallant dont you think jon says he looks like a girl arya said page sansa sighed as she stitched poor jon she said he gets jealous because hes a bastard hes our brother arya said much too loudly her voice cut through the afternoon quiet of the tower room septa mordane raised her eyes she had a bony face sharp eyes and a thin lipless mouth made for frowning it was frowning now what are you talking about children our half brother sansa corrected soft and precise she smiled for the septa arya and i were remarking on how pleased we were to have the princess with us today she said septa mordane nodded indeed a great honor for us all princess myrcella smiled uncertainly at the compliment arya why arent you at work the septa asked she rose to her feet starched skirts rustling as she started across the room let me see your stitches arya wanted to scream it was just like sansa to go and attract the septas attention here she said surrendering up her work the septa examined the fabric arya arya arya she said this will not do this will not do at all everyone was looking at her it was too much sansa was too well bred to smile at her sisters disgrace but jeyne was smirking on her behalf even princess myrcella looked sorry for her arya felt tears filling her eyes she pushed herself out of her chair and bolted for the door septa mordane called after her arya come back here dont you take another step your lady mother will hear of this in front of our royal princess too youll shame us all arya stopped at the door and turned back biting her lip the tears were running down her cheeks now she managed a stiff little bow to myrcella by your leave my lady myrcella blinked at her and looked to her ladies for guidance but if she was uncertain septa mordane was not just where do you think you are going arya the septa demanded arya glared at her i have to go shoe a horse she said sweetly taking a brief satisfaction in the shock on the septas face then she whirled and made her exit running down the steps as fast as her feet would take her it wasnt fair sansa had everything sansa was two years older maybe by the time arya had been born there had been nothing left often it felt that way sansa could sew and dance and sing she wrote poetry she knew how to dress she played the high harp and the bells worse she was beautiful sansa had gotten their mothers fine high cheekbones and the thick auburn hair of the tullys arya took after their lord father her hair was a lusterless brown and her face was long and solemn jeyne used to call her arya horseface and neigh whenever she came near it hurt that the one thing arya could do better than her sister was ride a horse well that and manage a household sansa had never had much of a head for figures if she did marry prince joff arya hoped for his sake that he had a good steward nymeria was waiting for her in the guardroom at the base of the stairs she bounded to her feet as soon as she caught sight of arya arya grinned the wolf pup loved her even if no one else did they went everywhere together and nymeria slept in her room at the foot of her bed if mother had not forbidden page it arya would gladly have taken the wolf with her to needlework let septa mordane complain about her stitches then nymeria nipped eagerly at her hand as arya untied her she had yellow eyes when they caught the sunlight they gleamed like two golden coins arya had named her after the warrior queen of the rhoyne who had led her people across the narrow sea that had been a great scandal too sansa of course had named her pup lady arya made a face and hugged the wolfling tight nymeria licked her ear and she giggled by now septa mordane would certainly have sent word to her lady mother if she went to her room they would find her arya did not care to be found she had a better notion the boys were at practice in the yard she wanted to see robb put gallant prince joffrey flat on his back come she whispered to nymeria she got up and ran the wolf coming hard at her heels there was a window in the covered bridge between the armory and the great keep where you had a view of the whole yard that was where they headed they arrived flushed and breathless to find jon seated on the sill one leg drawn up languidly to his chin he was watching the action so absorbed that he seemed unaware of her approach until his white wolf moved to meet them nymeria stalked closer on wary feet ghost already larger than his litter mates smelled her gave her ear a careful nip and settled back down jon gave her a curious look shouldnt you be working on your stitches little sister arya made a face at him i wanted to see them fight he smiled come here then arya climbed up on the window and sat beside him to a chorus of thuds and grunts from the yard below to her disappointment it was the younger boys drilling bran was so heavily padded he looked as though he had belted on a featherbed and prince tommen who was plump to begin with seemed positively round they were huffing and puffing and hitting at each other with padded wooden swords under the watchful eye of old ser rodrik cassel the masteratarms a great stout keg of a man with magnificent white cheek whiskers a dozen spectators man and boy were calling out encouragement robbs voice the loudest among them she spotted theon greyjoy beside him his black doublet emblazoned with the golden kraken of his house a look of wry contempt on his face both of the combatants were staggering arya judged that they had been at it awhile a shade more exhausting than needlework jon observed a shade more fun than needlework arya gave back at him jon grinned reached over and messed up her hair arya flushed they had always been close jon had their fathers face as she did they were the only ones robb and sansa and bran and even little rickon all took after the tullys with easy smiles and fire in their hair when arya had been little she had been afraid that meant that she was a bastard too it been jon she had gone to in her fear and jon who had reassured her georgl rr martin why arent you down in the yard arya asked him page he gave her a half smile bastards are not allowed to damage young princes he said any bruises they take in the practice yard must come from trueborn swords oh arya felt abashed she should have realized for the second time today arya reflected that life was not fair she watched her little brother whack at tommen i could do just as good as bran she said hes only seven im nine jon looked her over with all his fourteenyearold wisdom youre too skinny he said he took her arm to feel her muscle then he sighed and shook his head i doubt you could even lift a longsword little sister never mind swing one arya snatched back her arm and glared at him jon messed up her hair again they watched bran and tommen circle each other you see prince joffrey jon asked she hadnt not at first glance but when she looked again she found him to the back under the shade of the high stone wall he was surrounded by men she did not recognize young squires in the livery of lannister and baratheon strangers all there were a few older men among them knights she surmised look at the arms on his surcoat jon suggested arya looked an ornate shield had been embroidered on the princes padded surcoat no doubt the needlework was exquisite the arms were divided down the middle on one side was the crowned stag of the royal house on the other the lion of lannister the lannisters are proud jon observed youd think the royal sigil would be sufficient but no he makes his mothers house equal in honor to the kings the woman is important too arya protested jon chuckled perhaps you should do the same thing little sister wed tully to stark in your arms a wolf with a fish in its mouth it made her laugh that would look silly besides if a girl cant fight why should she have a coat of arms jon shrugged girls get the arms but not the swords bastards get the swords but not the arms i did not make the rules little sister there was a shout from the courtyard below prince tommen was rolling in the dust trying to get up and failing all the padding made him look like a turtle on its back bran was standing over him with upraised wooden sword ready to whack him again once he regained his feet the men began to laugh enough ser rodrik called out he gave the prince a hand and yanked him back to his feet well fought lew donnis help them out of their armor he looked around prince joffrey robb will you go another round page robb already sweaty from a previous bout moved forward eagerly gladly joffrey moved into the sunlight in response to rodriks summons his hair shone like spun gold he looked bored this is a game for children ser rodrik theon greyjoy gave a sudden bark of laughter you are children he said derisively robb may be a child joffrey said i am a prince and i grow tired of swatting at starks with a play sword you got more swats than you gave joff robb said are you afraid prince joffrey looked at him oh terrified he said youre so much older some of the lannister men laughed jon looked down on the scene with a frown joffrey is truly a little shit he told arya ser rodrik tugged thoughtfully at his white whiskers what are you suggesting he asked the prince live steel done robb shot back youll be sorry the masteratarms put a hand on robbs shoulder to quiet him live steel is too dangerous i will permit you tourney swords with blunted edges joffrey said nothing but a man strange to arya a tall knight with black hair and burn scars on his face pushed forward in front of the prince this is your prince who are you to tell him he may not have an edge on his sword ser masteratarms of winterfell clegane and you would do well not to forget it are you training women here the burned man wanted to know he was muscled like a bull i am training knights ser rodrik said pointedly they will have steel when they are ready when they are of an age the burned man looked at robb how old are you boy fourteen robb said i killed a man at twelve you can be sure it was not with a blunt sword arya could see robb bristle his pride was wounded he turned on ser rodrik let me do it i can beat him beat him with a tourney blade then ser rodrik said joffrey shrugged come and see me when youre older stark if youre not too old there was laughter from the lannister men page robbs curses rang through the yard arya covered her mouth in shock theon greyjoy seized robbs arm to keep him away from the prince ser rodrik tugged at his whiskers in dismay joffrey feigned a yawn and turned to his younger brother come tommen he said the hour of play is done leave the children to their frolics that brought more laughter from the lannisters more curses from robb ser rodriks face was beetred with fury under the white of his whiskers theon kept robb locked in an iron grip until the princes and their party were safely away jon watched them leave and arya watched jon his face had grown as still as the pool at the heart of the godswood finally he climbed down off the window the show is done he said he bent to scratch ghost behind the ears the white wolf rose and rubbed against him you had best run back to your room little sister septa mordane will surely be lurking the longer you hide the sterner the penance youll be sewing all through winter when the spring thaw comes they will find your body with a needle still locked tight between your frozen fingers arya didnt think it was funny i hate needlework she said with passion its not fair nothing is fair jon said he messed up her hair again and walked away from her ghost moving silently beside him nymeria started to follow too then stopped and came back when she saw that arya was not coming reluctantly she turned in the other direction it was worse than jon had thought it wasnt septa mordane waiting in her room it was septa mordane and her mother bran the hunt left at dawn the king wanted wild boar at the feast tonight prince joffrey rode with his father so robb had been allowed to join the hunters as well uncle benjen jory theon greyjoy ser rodrik and even the queens funny little brother had all ridden out with them it was the last hunt after all on the morrow they left for the south bran had been left behind with jon and the girls and rickon but rickon was only a baby and the girls were only girls and jon and his wolf were nowhere to be found bran did not look for him very hard he thought jon was angry at him jon seemed to be angry at everyone these days bran did not know why he was going with uncle ben to the wall to join the nights watch that was almost as good as going south with the king robb was the one they were leaving behind not jon for days bran could scarcely wait to be off he was going to ride the kingsroad on a horse of his own not a pony but a real horse his father would be the hand of the king and they were going to live in the red castle at kings landing the castle the dragonlords had built old nan said there were ghosts there and dungeons where terrible things had been done and dragon heads on the walls it gave bran a shiver just to think of it but he was not afraid how could he be afraid his father would be with him and the king with all his knights and sworn swords page bran was going to be a knight himself someday one of the kingsguard old nan said they were the finest swords in all the realm there were only seven of them and they wore white armor and had no wives or children but lived only to serve the king bran knew all the stories their names were like music to him serwyn of the mirror shield ser ryam redwyne prince aemon the dragonknight the twins ser erryk and ser arryk who had died on one anothers swords hundreds of years ago when brother fought sister in the war the singers called the dance of the dragons the white bull gerold hightower ser arthur dayne the sword of the morning barristan the bold two of the kingsguard had come north with king robert bran had watched them with fascination never quite daring to speak to them ser boros was a bald man with a jowly face and ser meryn had droopy eyes and a beard the color of rust ser jaime lannister looked more like the knights in the stories and he was of the kingsguard too but robb said he had killed the old mad king and shouldnt count anymore the greatest living knight was ser barristan selmy barristan the bold the lord commander of the kingsguard father had promised that they would meet ser barristan when they reached kings landing and bran had been marking the days on his wall eager to depart to see a world he had only dreamed of and begin a life he could scarcely imagine yet now that the last day was at hand suddenly bran felt lost winterfell had been the only home he had ever known his father had told him that he ought to say his farewells today and he had tried after the hunt had ridden out he wandered through the castle with his wolf at his side intending to visit the ones who would be left behind old nan and gage the cook mikken in his smithy hodor the stableboy who smiled so much and took care of his pony and never said anything but hodor the man in the glass gardens who gave him a blackberry when he came to visit but it was no good he had gone to the stable first and seen his pony there in its stall except it wasnt his pony anymore he was getting a real horse and leaving the pony behind and all of a sudden bran just wanted to sit down and cry he turned and ran off before hodor and the other stableboys could see the tears in his eyes that was the end of his farewells instead bran spent the morning alone in the godswood trying to teach his wolf to fetch a stick and failing the wolfling was smarter than any of the hounds in his fathers kennel and bran would have sworn he understood every word that was said to him but he showed very little interest in chasing sticks he was still trying to decide on a name robb was calling his grey wind because he ran so fast sansa had named hers lady and arya named hers after some old witch queen in the songs and little rickon called his shaggydog which bran thought was a pretty stupid name for a direwolf jons wolf the white one was ghost bran wished he had thought of that first even though his wolf wasnt white he had tried a hundred names in the last fortnight but none of them sounded right finally he got tired of the stick game and decided to go climbing he hadnt been up to the broken tower for weeks with everything that had happened and this might be his last chance he raced across the godswood taking the long way around to avoid the pool where the heart tree grew the heart tree had always frightened him trees ought not have eyes bran thought or leaves that looked like hands his wolf came sprinting at his heels you stay here he told him at the base of the sentinel tree near the armory wall lie down thats right now stay the wolf did as he was told bran scratched him behind the ears then turned away jumped grabbed a low branch and pulled himself up he was halfway up the tree moving easily from limb to limb when the wolf got to his feet and began to howl page bran looked back down his wolf fell silent staring up at him through slitted yellow eyes a strange chill went through him he began to climb again once more the wolf howled quiet he yelled sit down stay youre worse than mother the howling chased him all the way up the tree until finally he jumped off onto the armory roof and out of sight the rooftops of winterfell were brans second home his mother often said that bran could climb before he could walk bran could not remember when he first learned to walk but he could not remember when he started to climb either so he supposed it must be true to a boy winterfell was a grey stone labyrinth of walls and towers and courtyards and tunnels spreading out in all directions in the older parts of the castle the halls slanted up and down so that you couldnt even be sure what floor you were on the place had grown over the centuries like some monstrous stone tree maester luwin told him once and its branches were gnarled and thick and twisted its roots sunk deep into the earth when he got out from under it and scrambled up near the sky bran could see all of winterfell in a glance he liked the way it looked spread out beneath him only birds wheeling over his head while all the life of the castle went on below bran could perch for hours among the shapeless rainworn gargoyles that brooded over the first keep watching it all the men drilling with wood and steel in the yard the cooks tending their vegetables in the glass garden restless dogs running back and forth in the kennels the silence of the godswood the girls gossiping beside the washing well it made him feel like he was lord of the castle in a way even robb would never know it taught him winterfells secrets too the builders had not even leveled the earth there were hills and valleys behind the walls of winterfell there was a covered bridge that went from the fourth floor of the bell tower across to the second floor of the rookery bran knew about that and he knew you could get inside the inner wall by the south gate climb three floors and run all the way around winterfell through a narrow tunnel in the stone and then come out on ground level at the north gate with a hundred feet of wall looming over you even maester luwin didnt know that bran was convinced his mother was terrified that one day bran would slip off a wall and kill himself he told her that he wouldnt but she never believed him once she made him promise that he would stay on the ground he had managed to keep that promise for almost a fortnight miserable every day until one night he had gone out the window of his bedroom when his brothers were fast asleep he confessed his crime the next day in a fit of guilt lord eddard ordered him to the godswood to cleanse himself guards were posted to see that bran remained there alone all night to reflect on his disobedience the next morning bran was nowhere to be seen they finally found him fast asleep in the upper branches of the tallest sentinel in the grove as angry as he was his father could not help but laugh youre not my son he told bran when they fetched him down youre a squirrel so be it if you must climb then climb but try not to let your mother see you bran did his best although he did not think he ever really footed her since his father would not forbid it she turned to others old nan told him a story about a bad little boy who climbed too high and was struck down by lightning and how afterward the crows came to peck out his eyes bran was not impressed there were crows nests atop the broken tower where no one ever went but him and page sometimes he filled his pockets with corn before he climbed up there and the crows ate it right out of his hand none of them had ever shown the slightest bit of interest in pecking out his eyes later maester luwin built a little pottery boy and dressed him in brans clothes and flung him off the wall into the yard below to demonstrate what would happen to bran if he fell that had been fun but afterward bran just looked at the maester and said im not made of clay and anyhow i never fall then for a while the guards would chase him whenever they saw him on the roofs and try to haul him down that was the best time of all it was like playing a game with his brothers except that bran always won none of the guards could climb half so well as bran not even jory most of the time they never saw him anyway people never looked up that was another thing he liked about climbing it was almost like being invisible he liked how it felt too pulling himself up a wall stone by stone fingers and toes digging hard into the small crevices between he always took off his boots and went barefoot when he climbed it made him feel as if he had four hands instead of two he liked the deep sweet ache it left in the muscles afterward he liked the way the air tasted way up high sweet and cold as a winter peach he liked the birds the crows in the broken tower the tiny little sparrows that nested in cracks between the stones the ancient owl that slept in the dusty loft above the old armory bran knew them all most of all he liked going places that no one else could go and seeing the grey sprawl of winterfell in a way that no one else ever saw it it made the whole castle brans secret place his favorite haunt was the broken tower once it had been a watchtower the tallest in winterfell a long time ago a hundred years before even his father had been born a lightning strike had set it afire the top third of the structure had collapsed inward and the tower had never been rebuilt sometimes his father sent ratters into the base of the tower to clean out the nests they always found among the jumble of fallen stones and charred and rotten beams but no one ever got up to the jagged top of the structure now except for bran and the crows he knew two ways to get there you could climb straight up the side of the tower itself but the stones were loose the mortar that held them together long gone to ash and bran never liked to put his full weight on them the best way was to start from the godswood shinny up the tall sentinel and cross over the armory and the guards hall leaping roof to roof barefoot so the guards wouldnt hear you overhead that brought you up to the blind side of the first keep the oldest part of the castle a squat round fortress that was taller than it looked only rats and spiders lived there now but the old stones still made for good climbing you could go straight up to where the gargoyles leaned out blindly over empty space and swing from gargoyle to gargoyle hand over hand around to the north side from there if you really stretched you could reach out and pull yourself over to the broken tower where it leaned close the last part was the scramble up the blackened stones to the eyrie no more than ten feet and then the crows would come round to see if youd brought any corn bran was moving from gargoyle to gargoyle with the ease of long practice when he heard the voices he was so startled he almost lost his grip the first keep had been empty all his life i do not like it a woman was saying there was a row of windows beneath him and the voice was page drifting out of the last window on this side you should be the hand gods forbid a mans voice replied lazily its not an honor id want theres far too much work involved bran hung listening suddenly afraid to go on they might glimpse his feet if he tried to swing by dont you see the danger this puts us in the woman said robert loves the man like a brother robert can barely stomach his brothers not that i blame him stannis would be enough to give anyone indigestion dont play the fool stannis and renly are one thing and eddard stark is quite another robert will listen to stark damn them both i should have insisted that he name you but i was certain stark would refuse him we ought to count ourselves fortunate the man said the king might as easily have named one of his brothers or even littlefinger gods help us give me honorable enemies rather than ambitious ones and ill sleep more easily by night they were talking about father bran realized he wanted to hear more a few more feet but they would see him if he swung out in front of the window we will have to watch him carefully the woman said i would sooner watch you the man said he sounded bored come back here lord eddard has never taken any interest in anything that happened south of the neck the woman said never i tell you he means to move against us why else would he leave the seat of his power a hundred reasons duty honor he yearns to write his name large across the book of history to get away from his wife or both perhaps he just wants to be warm for once in his life his wife is lady arryns sister its a wonder lysa was not here to greet us with her accusations bran looked down there was a narrow ledge beneath the window only a few inches wide he tried to lower himself toward it too far he would never reach you fret too much lysa arryn is a frightened cow that frightened cow shared jon arryns bed if she knew anything she would have gone to robert before she fled kings landing when he had already agreed to foster that weakling son of hers at casterly rock i think not she knew the boys life would be hostage to her silence she may grow bolder now that hes safe atop the eyrie mothers the man made the word sound like a curse i think birthing does something to your minds you are all mad he laughed it was a bitter sound let lady arryn grow as bold as she likes whatever she knows whatever she thinks she knows she has no proof he paused a moment or page does she do you think the king will require proof the woman said i tell you he loves me not and whose fault is that sweet sister bran studied the ledge he could drop down it was too narrow to land on but if he could catch hold as he fell past pull himself up except that might make a noise draw them to the window he was not sure what he was hearing but he knew it was not meant for his ears you are as blind as robert the woman was saying if you mean i see the same thing yes the man said i see a man who would sooner die than betray his king he betrayed one already or have you forgotten the woman said oh i dont deny hes loyal to robert thats obvious what happens when robert dies and joff takes the throne and the sooner that comes to pass the safer well all be my husband grows more restless every day having stark beside him will only make him worse hes still in love with the sister the insipid little dead sixteenyearold how long till he decides to put me aside for some new lyanna bran was suddenly very frightened he wanted nothing so much as to go back the way he had come to find his brothers only what would he tell them he had to get closer bran realized he had to see who was talking the man sighed you should think less about the future and more about the pleasures at hand stop that the woman said bran heard the sudden slap of flesh on flesh then the mans laughter bran pulled himself up climbed over the gargoyle crawled out onto the roof this was the easy way he moved across the roof to the next gargoyle right above the window of the room where they were talking all this talk is getting very tiresome sister the man said come here and be quiet bran sat astride the gargoyle tightened his legs around it and swung himself around upside down he hung by his legs and slowly stretched his head down toward the window the world looked strange upside down a courtyard swam dizzily below him its stones still wet with melted snow bran looked in the window inside the room a man and a woman were wrestling they were both naked bran could not tell who they were the mans back was to him and his body screened the woman from view as he pushed her up against a wall there were soft wet sounds bran realized they were kissing he watched wideeyed and frightened his breath tight in his throat the man had a hand down between her legs and he must have been hurting her there because the woman started to moan low in her throat stop it she said stop it stop it oh please but her voice was low and weak and she did not push him away her hands buried themselves in his hair his tangled golden hair and pulled his face down to her breast bran saw her face her eyes were closed and her mouth was open moaning her golden hair swung page from side to side as her head moved back and forth but still he recognized the queen he must have made a noise suddenly her eyes opened and she was staring right at him she screamed everything happened at once then the woman pushed the man away wildly shouting and pointing bran tried to pull himself up bending double as he reached for the gargoyle he as in too much of a hurry his hand scraped uselessly across smooth stone and in his panic his legs slipped and suddenly he was failing there was an instant of vertigo a sickening lurch as the window flashed past he shot out a hand grabbed for the ledge lost it caught it again with his other hand he swung against the building hard the impact took the breath out of him bran dangled onehanded panting faces appeared in the window above him the queen and now bran recognized the man beside her they looked as much alike as reflections in a mirror he saw us the woman said shrilly so he did the man said brans fingers started to slip he grabbed the ledge with his other hand fingernails dug into unyielding stone the man reached down take my hand he said before you fall bran seized his arm and held on tight with all his strength the man yanked him up to the ledge what are you doing the woman demanded the man ignored her he was very strong he stood bran up on the sill how old are you boy seven bran said shaking with relief his fingers had dug deep gouges in the mans forearm he let go sheepishly the man looked over at the woman the things i do for love he said with loathing he gave bran a shove screaming bran went backward out the window into empty air there was nothing to grab on to the courtyard rushed up to meet him somewhere off in the distance a wolf was howling crows circled the broken tower waiting for corn page tyrion somewhere in the great stone maze of winterfell a wolf howled the sound hung over the castle like a flag of mourning tyrion lannister looked up from his books and shivered though the library was snug and warm something about the howling of a wolf took a man right out of his here and now and left him in a dark forest of the mind running naked before the pack when the direwolf howled again tyrion shut the heavy leatherbound cover on the book he was reading a hundredyearold discourse on the changing of the seasons by a longdead maester he covered a yawn with the back of his hand his reading lamp was flickering its oil all but gone as dawn light leaked through the high windows he had been at it all night but that was nothing new tyrion lannister was not much a one for sleeping his legs were stiff and sore as he eased down off the bench he massaged some life back into them and limped heavily to the table where the septon was snoring softly his head pillowed on an open book in front of him tyrion glanced at the title a life of the grand maester aethelmure no wonder chayle he said softly the young man jerked up blinking confused the crystal of his order swinging wildly on its silver chain im off to break my fast see that you return the books to the shelves be gentle with the valyrian scrolls the parchment is very dry ayrmidons engines of war is quite rare and yours is the only complete copy ive ever seen chayle gaped at him still halfasleep patiently tyrion repeated his instructions then clapped the septon on the shoulder and left him to his tasks outside tyrion swallowed a lungful of the cold morning air and began his laborious descent of the steep stone steps that corkscrewed around the exterior of the library tower it was slow going the steps were cut high and narrow while his legs were short and twisted the rising sun had not yet cleared the walls of winterfell but the men were already hard at it in the yard below sandor cleganes rasping voice drifted up to him the boy is a long time dying i wish he would be quicker about it tyrion glanced down and saw the hound standing with young joffrey as squires swarmed around them at least he dies quietly the prince replied its the wolf that makes the noise i could scarce sleep last night clegane cast a long shadow across the hardpacked earth as his squire lowered the black helm over his head i could silence the creature if it please you he said through his open visor his boy placed a longsword in his hand he tested the weight of it slicing at the cold morning air behind him the yard rang to the clangor of steel on steel the notion seemed to delight the prince send a dog to kill a dog he exclaimed winterfell is so infested with wolves the starks would never miss one tyrion hopped off the last step onto the yard i beg to differ nephew he said the starks can count past six unlike some princes i might name joffrey had the grace at least to blush page a voice from nowhere sandor said he peered through his helm looking this way and that spirits of the air the prince laughed as he always laughed when his bodyguard did this mummers farce tyrion was used to it down here the tall man peered down at the ground and pretended to notice him the little lord tyrion he said my pardons i did not see you standing there i am in no mood for your insolence today tyrion turned to his nephew joffrey it is past time you called on lord eddard and his lady to offer them your comfort joffrey looked as petulant as only a boy prince can look what good will my comfort do them none tyrion said yet it is expected of you your absence has been noted the stark boy is nothing to me joffrey said i cannot abide the wailing of women tyrion lannister reached up and slapped his nephew hard across the face the boys cheek began to redden one word tyrion said and i will hit you again im going to tell mother joffrey exclaimed tyrion hit him again now both cheeks flamed you tell your mother tyrion told him but first you get yourself to lord and lady stark and you fall to your knees in front of them and you tell them how very sorry you are and that you are at their service if there is the slightest thing you can do for them or theirs in this desperate hour and that all your prayers go with them do you understand do you the boy looked as though he was going to cry instead he managed a weak nod then he turned and fled headlong from the yard holding his cheek tyrion watched him run a shadow fell across his face he turned to find clegane looming overhead like a cliff his sootdark armor seemed to blot out the sun he had lowered the visor on his helm it was fashioned in the likeness of a snarling black hound fearsome to behold but tyrion had always thought it a great improvement over cleganes hideously burned face the prince will remember that little lord the hound warned him the helm turned his laugh into a hollow rumble i pray he does tyrion lannister replied if he forgets be a good dog and remind him he glanced around the courtyard do you know where i might find my brother breaking fast with the queen ah tyrion said he gave sandor clegane a perfunctory nod and walked away as briskly as his stunted legs would carry him whistling he pitied the first knight to try the hound today the man did have a temper page a cold cheerless meal had been laid out in the morning room of the guest house jaime sat at table with cersei and the children talking in low hushed voices is robert still abed tyrion asked as he seated himself uninvited at the table his sister peered at him with the same expression of faint distaste she had worn since the day he was born the king has not slept at all she told him he is with lord eddard he has taken their sorrow deeply to heart he has a large heart our robert jaime said with a lazy smile there was very little that jaime took seriously tyrion knew that about his brother and forgave it during all the terrible long years of his childhood only jaime had ever shown him the smallest measure of affection or respect and for that tyrion was willing to forgive him most anything a servant approached bread tyrion told him and two of those little fish and a mug of that good dark beer to wash them down oh and some bacon burn it until it turns black the man bowed and moved off tyrion turned back to his siblings twins male and female they looked very much the part this morning both had chosen a deep green that matched their eyes their blond curls were all a fashionable tumble and gold ornaments shone at wrists and fingers and throats tyrion wondered what it would be like to have a twin and decided that he would rather not know bad enough to face himself in a looking glass every day another him was a thought too dreadful to contemplate prince tommen spoke up do you have news of bran uncle i stopped by the sickroom last night tyrion announced there was no change the maester thought that a hopeful sign i dont want brandon to die tommen said timorously he was a sweet boy not like his brother but then jaime and tyrion were somewhat less than peas in a pod themselves lord eddard had a brother named brandon as well jaime mused one of the hostages murdered by targaryen it seems to be an unlucky name oh not so unlucky as all that surely tyrion said the servant brought his plate he ripped off a chunk of black bread cersei was studying him warily what do you mean tyrion gave her a crooked smile why only that tommen may get his wish the maester thinks the boy may yet live he took a sip of beer myrcella gave a happy gasp and tommen smiled nervously but it was not the children tyrion was watching the glance that passed between jaime and cersei lasted no more than a second but he did not miss it then his sister dropped her gaze to the table that is no mercy these northern gods are cruel to let the child linger in such pain page what were the maesters words jaime asked the bacon crunched when he bit into it tyrion chewed thoughtfully for a moment and said he thinks that if the boy were going to die he would have done so already it has been four days with no change will bran get better uncle little myrcella asked she had all of her mothers beauty and none of her nature his back is broken little one tyrion told her the fall shattered his legs as well they keep him alive with honey and water or he would starve to death perhaps if he wakes he will be able to eat real food but he will never walk again if he wakes cersei repeated is that likely the gods alone know tyrion told her the maester only hopes he chewed some more bread i would swear that wolf of his is keeping the boy alive the creature is outside his window day and night howling every time they chase it away it returns the maester said they closed the window once to shut out the noise and bran seemed to weaken when they opened it again his heart beat stronger the queen shuddered there is something unnatural about those animals she said they are dangerous i will not have any of them coming south with us jaime said youll have a hard time stopping them sister they follow those girls everywhere tyrion started on his fish are you leaving soon then not near soon enough cersei said then she frowned are we leaving she echoed what about you gods dont tell me you are staying here tyrion shrugged benjen stark is returning to the nights watch with his brothers bastard i have a mind to go with them and see this wall we have all heard so much of jaime smiled i hope youre not thinking of taking the black on us sweet brother tyrion laughed what me celibate the whores would go begging from dorne to casterly rock no i just want to stand on top of the wall and piss off the edge of the world cersei stood abruptly the children dont need to hear this filth tommen myrcella come she strode briskly from the morning room her train and her pups trailing behind her jaime lannister regarded his brother thoughtfully with those cool green eyes stark will never consent to leave winterfell with his son lingering in the shadow of death he will if robert commands it tyrion said and robert will command it there is nothing lord eddard can do for the boy in any case he could end his torment jaime said i would if it were my son it would be a mercy i advise against putting that suggestion to lord eddard sweet brother tyrion said he would not take it kindly page even if the boy does live he will be a cripple worse than a cripple a grotesque give me a good clean death tyrion replied with a shrug that accentuated the twist of his shoulders speaking for the grotesques he said i beg to differ death is so terribly final while life is full of possibilities jaime smiled you are a perverse little imp arent you oh yes tyrion admitted i hope the boy does wake i would be most interested to hear what he might have to say his brothers smile curdled like sour milk tyrion my sweet brother he said darkly there are times when you give me cause to wonder whose side you are on tyrions mouth was full of bread and fish he took a swallow of strong black beer to wash it all down and grinned up wolfishly at jaime why jaime my sweet brother he said you wound me you know how much i love my family jon on climbed the steps slowly trying not to think that this might be the last time ever ghost padded silently beside him outside snow swirled through the castle gates and the yard was all noise and chaos but inside the thick stone walls it was still warm and quiet too quiet for jons liking he reached the landing and stood for a long moment afraid ghost nuzzled at his hand he took courage from that he straightened and entered the room lady stark was there beside his bed she had been there day and night for close on a fortnight not for a moment had she left brans side she had her meals brought to her there and chamber pots as well and a small hard bed to sleep on though it was said she had scarcely slept at all she fed him herself the honey and water and herb mixture that sustained life not once did she leave the room so jon had stayed away but now there was no more time he stood in the door for a moment afraid to speak afraid to come closer the window was open below a wolf howled ghost heard and lifted his head lady stark looked over for a moment she did not seem to recognize him finally she blinked what areyou doing here she asked in a voice strangely flat and emotionless i came to see bran jon said to say goodbye her face did not change her long auburn hair was dull and tangled she looked as though she had aged twenty years youve said it now go away part of him wanted only to flee but he knew that if he did he might never see bran again he took a nervous step into the room please he said page something cold moved in her eyes i told you to leave she said we dont want you here once that would have sent him running once that might even have made him cry now it only made him angry he would be a sworn brother of the nights watch soon and face worse dangers than catelyn tully stark hes my brother he said shall i call the guards call them jon said defiant you cant stop me from seeing him he crossed the room keeping the bed between them and looked down on bran where he lay she was holding one of his hands it looked like a claw this was not the bran he remembered the flesh had all gone from him his skin stretched tight over bones like sticks under the blanket his legs bent in ways that made jon sick his eyes were sunken deep into black pits open but they saw nothing the fall had shrunken him somehow he looked half a leaf as if the first strong wind would carry him off to his grave yet under the frail cage of those shattered ribs his chest rose and fell with each shallow breath bran he said im sorry i didnt come before i was afraid he could feel the tears rolling down his cheeks jon no longer cared dont die bran please were all waiting for you to wake up me and robb and the girls everyone lady stark was watching she had not raised a cry jon took that for acceptance outside the window the direwolf howled again the wolf that bran had not had time to name i have to go now jon said uncle benjen is waiting im to go north to the wall we have to leave today before the snows come he remembered how excited bran had been at the prospect of the journey it was more than he could bear the thought of leaving him behind like this jon brushed away his tears leaned over and kissed his brother lightly on the lips i wanted him to stay here with me lady stark said softly jon watched her wary she was not even looking at him she was george rr martm talking to him but for a part of her it was as though he were not even in the room i prayed for it she said dully he was my special boy i went to the sept and prayed seven times to the seven faces of god that ned would change his mind and leave him here with me sometimes prayers are answered jon did not know what to say it wasnt your fault he managed after an awkward silence her eyes found him they were full of poison i need none of your absolution bastard jon lowered his eyes she was cradling one of brans hands he took the other squeezed it fingers like the bones of birds goodbye he said he was at the door when she called out to him jon she said he should have kept going but she had page never called him by his name before he turned to find her looking at his face as if she were seeing it for the first time yes he said it should have been you she told him then she turned back to bran and began to weep her whole body shaking with the sobs jon had never seen her cry before it was a long walk down to the yard outside everything was noise and confusion wagons were being loaded men were shouting horses were being harnessed and saddled and led from the stables a light snow had begun to fall and everyone was in an uproar to be off robb was in the middle of it shouting commands with the best of them he seemed to have grown of late as if brans fall and his mothers collapse had somehow made him stronger grey wind was at his side uncle benjen is looking for you he told jon he wanted to be gone an hour ago i know jon said soon he looked around at all the noise and confusion leaving is harder than i thought for me too robb said he had snow in his hair melting from the heat of his body did you see him jon nodded not trusting himself to speak hes not going to die robb said i know it you starks are hard to kill jon agreed his voice was flat and tired the visit had taken all the strength from him robb knew something was wrong my mother she was very kind jon told him robb looked relieved good he smiled the next time i see you youll be all in black jon forced himself to smile back it was always my color how long do you think it will be soon enough robb promised he pulled jon to him and embraced him fiercely farewell snow jon hugged him back and you stark take care of bran i will they broke apart and looked at each other awkwardly uncle benjen said to send you to the stables if i saw you robb finally said i have one more farewell to make jon told him then i havent seen you robb replied jon left him standing there in the snow surrounded by wagons and wolves and horses it was a short walk to the armory he picked up his package and took the page covered bridge across to the keep arya was in her room packing a polished ironwood chest that was bigger than she was nymeria was helping arya would only have to point and the wolf would bound across the room snatch up some wisp of silk in her jaws and fetch it back but when she smelled ghost she sat down on her haunches and yelped at them arya glanced behind her saw jon and jumped to her feet she threw her skinny arms tight around his neck i was afraid you were gone she said her breath catching in her throat they wouldnt let me out to say goodbye what did you do now jon was amused arya disentangled herself from him and made a face nothing i was all packed and everything she gestured at the huge chest no more than a third full and at the clothes that were scattered all over the room septa mordane says i have to do it all over my things werent properly folded she says a proper southron lady doesnt just throw her clothes inside her chest like old rags she says is that what you did little sister well theyre going to get all messed up anyway she said who cares how theyre folded septa mordane jon told her i dont think shed like nymeria helping either the shewolf regarded him silently with her dark golden eyes its just as well i have something for you to take with you and it has to be packed very carefully her face lit up a present you could call it that close the door wary but excited arya checked the hall nymeria here guard she left the wolf out there to warn of intruders and closed the door by then jon had pulled off the rags hed wrapped it in he held it out to her aryas eyes went wide dark eyes like his a sword she said in a small hushed breath the scabbard was soft grey leather supple as sin jon drew out the blade slowly so she could see the deep blue sheen of the steel this is no toy he told her be careful you dont cut yourself the edges are sharp enough to shave with girls dont shave arya said maybe they should have you ever seen the septas legs she giggled at him its so skinny so are you jon told her i had mikken make this special the bravos use swords like this in pentos and myr and the other free cities it wont hack a mans head off but it can poke him full of holes if youre fast enough page i can be fast arya said youll have to work at it every day he put the sword in her hands showed her how to hold it and stepped back how does it feel do you like the balance i think so arya said first lesson jon said stick them with the pointy end arya gave him a whap on the arm with the flat of her blade the blow stung but jon found himself grinning like an idiot i know which end to use arya said a doubtful look crossed her face septa mordane will take it away from me not if she doesnt know you have it jon said who will i practice with youll find someone jon promised her kings landing is a true city a thousand times the size of winterfell until you find a partner watch how they fight in the yard run and ride make yourself strong and whatever you do arya knew what was coming next they said it together dont tell sansa jon messed up her hair i will miss you little sister suddenly she looked like she was going to cry i wish you were coming with us different roads sometimes lead to the same castle who knows he was feeling better now he was not going to let himself be sad i better go ill spend my first year on the wall emptying chamber pots if i keep uncle ben waiting any longer arya ran to him for a last hug put down the sword first jon warned her laughing she set it aside almost shyly and showered him with kisses when he turned back at the door she was holding it again trying it for balance i almost forgot he told her all the best swords have names like ice she said she looked at the blade in her hand does this have a name oh tell me cant you guess jon teased your very favorite thing arya seemed puzzled at first then it came to her she was that quick they said it together needle the memory of her laughter warmed him on the long ride north page daenerys daenerys targaryen wed khal drogo with fear and barbaric splendor in a field beyond the walls of pentos for the dothraki believed that all things of importance in a mans life must be done beneath the open sky drogo had called his khalasar to attend him and they had come forty thousand dothraki warriors and uncounted numbers of women children and slaves outside the city walls they camped with their vast herds raising palaces of woven grass eating everything in sight and making the good folk of pentos more anxious with every passing day my fellow magisters have doubled the size of the city guard illyrio told them over platters of honey duck and orange snap peppers one night at the manse that had been drogos the khal had joined his khalasar his estate given over to daenerys and her brother until the wedding best we get princess daenerys wedded quickly before they hand half the wealth of pentos away to sellswords and bravos ser jorah mormont jested the exile had offered her brother his sword the night dany had been sold to kbal drogo viserys had accepted eagerly mormont had been their constant companion ever since magister illyrio laughed lightly through his forked beard but viserys did not so much as smile he can have her tomorrow if he likes her brother said he glanced over at dany and she lowered her eyes so long as he pays the price illyrio waved a languid hand in the air rings glittering on his fat fingers i have told you all is settled trust me the khal has promised you a crown and you shall have it yes but when when the khal chooses illyrio said he will have the girl first and after they are wed he must make his procession across the plains and present her to the dosh khaleen at vaes dolthrak after that perhaps if the omens favor war viserys seethed with impatience i piss on dothraki omens the usurper sits on my fathers throne how long must i wait illyrio gave a massive shrug you have waited most of your life great king what is another few months another few years ser jorah who had traveled as far east as vaes dothrak nodded in agreement i counsel you to be patient your grace the dothraki are true to their word but they do things in their own time a lesser man may beg a favor from the khal but must never presume to berate him viserys bristled guard your tongue mormont or ill have it out i am no lesser man i am the rightful lord of the seven kingdoms the dragon does not beg ser jorah lowered his eyes respectfully illyrio smiled enigmatically and tore a wing from the duck honey and grease ran over his fingers and dripped down into his beard as he nibbled at the tender meat page there are no more dragons dany thought staring at her brother though she did not dare say it aloud yet that night she dreamt of one viserys was hitting her hurting her she was naked clumsy with fear she ran from him but her body seemed thick and ungainly he struck her again she stumbled and fell you woke the dragon he screamed as he kicked her you woke the dragon you woke the dragon her thighs were slick with blood she closed her eyes and whimpered as if in answer there was a hideous ripping sound and the crackling of some great fire when she looked again viserys was gone great columns of flame rose all around and in the midst of them was the dragon it turned its great head slowly when its molten eyes found hers she woke shaking and covered with a fine sheen of sweat she had never been so afraid until the day of her wedding came at last the ceremony began at dawn and continued until dusk an endless day of drinking and feasting and fighting a mighty earthen ramp had been raised amid the grass palaces and there dany was seated beside khal drogo above the seething sea of dothraki she had never seen so many people in one place nor people so strange and frightening the horselords might put on rich fabrics and sweet perfumes when they visited the free cities but out under the open sky they kept the old ways men and women alike wore painted leather vests over bare chests and horsehair leggings cinched by bronze medallion belts and the warriors greased their long braids with fat from the rendering pits they gorged themselves on horseflesh roasted with honey and peppers drank themselves blind on fermented mares milk and illyrios fine wines and spat jests at each other across the fires their voices harsh and alien in danys ears viserys was seated just below her splendid in a new black wool tunic with a scarlet dragon on the chest illyrio and ser jorah sat beside him theirs was a place of high honor just below the khals own bloodriders but dany could see the anger in her brothers lilac eyes he did not like sitting beneath her and he fumed when the slaves offered each dish first to the khal and his bride and served him from the portions they refused he could do nothing but nurse his resentment so nurse it he did his mood growing blacker by the hour at each insult to his person dany had never felt so alone as she did seated in the midst of that vast horde her brother had told her to smile and so she smiled until her face ached and the tears came unbidden to her eyes she did her best to hide them knowing how angry viserys would be if he saw her crying terrified of how khal drogo might react food was brought to her steaming joints of meat and thick black sausages and dothraki blood pies and later fruits and sweetgrass stews and delicate pastries from the kitchens of pentos but she waved it all away her stomach was a roil and she knew she could keep none of it down there was no one to talk to khal drogo shouted commands and jests down to his bloodriders and laughed at their replies but he scarcely glanced at dany beside him they had no common language dothraki was incomprehensible to her and the khal knew only a few words of the bastard valyrian of the free cities and none at all of the common tongue of the seven kingdoms she would even have welcomed the conversation of illyrio and her brother but they were too far below to hear her so she sat in her wedding silks nursing a cup of honeyed wine afraid to eat talking silently to herself i am blood of the dragon she told herself i am daenerys stormborn princess of dragonstone of the blood and seed of aegon the conqueror the sun was only a quarter of the way up the sky when she saw her page first man die drums were beating as some of the women danced for the khal drogo watched without expression but his eyes followed their movements and from time to time he would toss down a bronze medallion for the women to fight over the warriors were watching too one of them finally stepped into the circle grabbed a dancer by the arm pushed her down to the ground and mounted her right there as a stallion mounts a mare illyrio had told her that might happen the dothraki mate like the animals in their herds there is no privacy in a khalasar and they do not understand sin or shame as we do dany looked away from the coupling frightened when she realized what was happening but a second warrior stepped forward and a third and soon there was no way to avert her eyes then two men seized the same woman she heard a shout saw a shove and in the blink of an eye the arakhs were out long razorsharp blades half sword and half scythe a dance of death began as the warriors circled and slashed leaping toward each other whirling the blades around their heads shrieking insults at each clash no one made a move to interfere it ended as quickly as it began the arakhs shivered together faster than dany could follow one man missed a step the other swung his blade in a flat arc steel bit into flesh just above the dothrakis waist and opened him from backbone to belly button spilling his entrails into the dust as the loser died the winner took hold of the nearest womannot even the one they had been quarreling overand had her there and then slaves carried off the body and the dancing resumed magister illyrio had warned dany about this too a dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is deemed a dull affair he had said her wedding must have been especially blessed before the day was over a dozen men had died as the hours passed the terror grew in dany until it was all she could do not to scream she was afraid of the dothraki whose ways seemed alien and monstrous as if they were beasts in human skins and not true men at all she was afraid of her brother of what he might do if she failed him most of all she was afraid of what would happen tonight under the stars when her brother gave her up to the hulking giant who sat drinking beside her with a face as still and cruel as a bronze mask i am the blood of the dragon she told herself again when at last the sun was low in the sky khal drogo clapped his hands together and the drums and the shouting and feasting came to a sudden halt drogo stood and pulled dany to her feet beside him it was time for her bride gifts and after the gifts she knew after the sun had gone down it would be time for the first ride and the consummation of her marriage dany tried to put the thought aside but it would not leave her she hugged herself to try to keep from shaking her brother viserys gifted her with three handmaids dany knew they had cost him nothing illyrio no doubt had provided the girls irri and jhiqui were copperskinned dothraki with black hair and almondshaped eyes doreah a fairhaired blueeyed lysene girl these are no common servants sweet sister her brother told her as they were brought forward one by one illyrio and i selected them personally for you irri will teach you riding jhiqui the dothraki tongue and doreah will instruct you in the womanly arts of love he smiled thinly shes very good illyrio and i can both swear to that page ser jorah mormont apologized for his gift it is a small thing my princess but all a poor exile could afford he said as he laid a small stack of old books before her they were histories and songs of the seven kingdoms she saw written in the common tongue she thanked him with all her heart magister illyrio murmured a command and four burly slaves hurried forward bearing between them a great cedar chest bound in bronze when she opened it she found piles of the finest velvets and damasks the free cities could produce and resting on top nestled in the soft cloth three huge eggs dany gasped they were the most beautiful things she had ever seen each different than the others patterned in such rich colors that at first she thought they were crusted with jewels and so large it took both of her hands to hold one she lifted it delicately expecting that it would be made of some fine porcelain or delicate enamel or even blown glass but it was much heavier than that as if it were all of solid stone the surface of the shell was covered with tiny scales and as she turned the egg between her fingers they shimmered like polished metal in the light of the setting sun one egg was a deep green with burnished bronze flecks that came and went depending on how dany turned it another was pale cream streaked with gold the last was black as black as a midnight sea yet alive with scarlet ripples and swirls what are they she asked her voice hushed and full of wonder dragons eggs from the shadow lands beyond asshai said magister illyrio the eons have turned them to stone yet still they burn bright with beauty i shall treasure them always dany had heard tales of such eggs but she had never seen one nor thought to see one it was a truly magnificent gift though she knew that illyrio could afford to be lavish he had collected a fortune in horses and slaves for his part in selling her to khal drogo the khals bloodriders offered her the traditional three weapons and splendid weapons they were haggo gave her a great leather whip with a silver handle cohollo a magnificent arakh chased in gold and qotho a doublecurved dragonbone bow taller than she was magister illyrio and ser jorah had taught her the traditional refusals for these offerings this is a gift worthy of a great warrior blood of my blood and i am but a woman let my lord husband bear these in my stead and so khal drogo too received his bride gifts other gifts she was given in plenty by other dothraki slippers and jewels and silver rings for her hair medallion belts and painted vests and soft furs sandsilks and jars of scent needles and feathers and tiny bottles of purple glass and a gown made from the skin of a thousand mice a handsome gift khaleesi magister illyrio said of the last after he had told her what it was most lucky the gifts mounted up around her in great piles more gifts than she could possibly imagine more gifts than she could want or use and last of all khal drogo brought forth his own bride gift to her an expectant hush rippled out from the center of the camp as he left her side growing until it had swallowed the whole khalasar when he returned the dense press of dothraki giftgivers parted before him and he led the horse to her she was a young filly spirited and splendid dany knew just enough about horses to know that this was no ordinary animal there was something about her that took the breath away she was grey as the winter sea with a mane like silver smoke hesitantly she reached out and stroked the horses neck ran her fingers through the silver of her mane khal drogo said something in dothraki and magister illyrio translated silver for the silver of your hair the khal says page shes beautiful dany murmured she is the pride of the khalasar illyrio said custom decrees that the khaleesi must ride a mount worthy of her place by the side of the khal drogo stepped forward and put his hands on her waist he lifted her up as easily as if she were a child and set her on the thin dothraki saddle so much smaller than the ones she was used to dany sat there uncertain for a moment no one had told her about this part what should i do she asked illyrio it was ser jorah mormont who answered take the reins and ride you need not go far nervously dany gathered the reinsin her hands and slid her feet into the short stirrups she was only a fair rider she had spent far more time traveling by ship and wagon and palanquin than by horseback praying that she would not fall off and disgrace herself she gave the filly the lightest and most timid touch with her knees and for the first time in hours she forgot to be afraid or perhaps it was for the first time ever the silvergrey filly moved with a smooth and silken gait and the crowd parted for her every eye upon them dany found herself moving faster than she had intended yet somehow it was exciting rather than terrifying the horse broke into a trot and she smiled dothraki scrambled to clear a path the slightest pressure with her legs the lightest touch on the reins and the filly responded she sent it into a gallop and now the dothraki were hooting and laughing and shouting at her as they jumped out of her way as she turned to ride back a firepit loomed ahead directly in her path they were hemmed in on either side with no room to stop a daring she had never known filled daenerys then and she gave the filly her head the silver horse leapt the flames as if she had wings when she pulled up before magister illyrio she said tell khal drogo that he has given me the wind the fat pentoshi stroked his yellow beard as he repeated her words in dothraki and dany saw her new husband smile for the first time the last sliver of sun vanished behind the high walls of pentos to the west just then dany had lost all track of time khal drogo commanded his bloodriders to bring forth his own horse a lean red stallion as the khal was saddling the horse viserys slid close to dany on her silver dug his fingers into her leg and said please him sweet sister or i swear you will see the dragon wake as it has never woken before the fear came back to her then with her brothers words she felt like a child once more only thirteen and all alone not ready for what was about to happen to her they rode out together as the stars came out leaving the khalasar and the grass palaces behind khal drogo spoke no word to her but drove his stallion at a hard trot through the gathering dusk the tiny silver bells in his long braid rang softly as he rode i am the blood of the dragon she whispered aloud as she followed trying to keep her courage up i am the blood of the dragon i am the blood of the dragon the dragon was never afraid afterward she could not say how far or how long they had ridden but it was full dark when they stopped at a grassy place beside a small stream drogo swung off his horse and lifted her down from page hers she felt as fragile as glass in his hands her limbs as weak as water she stood there helpless and trembling in her wedding silks while he secured the horses and when he turned to look at her she began to cry khal drogo stared at her tears his face strangely empty of expression no he said he lifted his hand and rubbed away the tears roughly with a callused thumb you speak the common tongue dany said in wonder no he said again perhaps he had only that word she thought but it was one word more than she had known he had and somehow it made her feel a little better drogo touched her hair lightly sliding the silverblond strands between his fingers and murmuring softly in dothraki dany did not understand the words yet there was warmth in the tone a tenderness she had never expected from this man he put his finger under her chin and lifted her head so she was looking up into his eyes drogo towered over her as he towered over everyone taking her lightly under the arms he lifted her and seated her on a rounded rock beside the stream then he sat on the ground facing her legs crossed beneath him their faces finally at a height no he said is that the only word you know she asked him drogo did not reply his long heavy braid was coiled in the dirt beside him he pulled it over his right shoulder and began to remove the bells from his hair one by one after a moment dany leaned forward to help when they were done drogo gestured she understood slowly carefully she began to undo his braid it took a long time all the while he sat there silently watching her when she was done he shook his head and his hair spread out behind him like a river of darkness oiled and gleaming she had never seen hair so long so black so thick then it was his turn he began to undress her his fingers were deft and strangely tender he removed her silks one by one carefully while dany sat unmoving silent looking at his eyes when he bared her small breasts she could not help herself she averted her eyes and covered herself with her hands no drogo said he pulled her hands away from her breasts gently but firmly then lifted her face again to make her look at him no he repeated no she echoed back at him he stood her up then and pulled her close to remove the last of her silks the night air was chilly on her bare skin she shivered and gooseflesh covered her arms and legs she was afraid of what would come next but for a while nothing happened khal drogo sat with his legs crossed looking at her drinking in her body with his eyes after a while he began to touch her lightly at first then harder she could sense the fierce strength in his hands but he never hurt her he held her hand in his own and brushed her fingers one by one he ran a hand gently down her leg he stroked her face tracing the curve of her ears running a finger gently around her mouth he put both hands in her hair and combed it with his fingers he turned her around page massaged her shoulders slid a knuckle down the path of her spine it seemed as if hours passed before his hands finally went to her breasts he stroked the soft skin underneath until it tingled he circled her nipples with his thumbs pinched them between thumb and forefinger then began to pull at her very lightly at first then more insistently until her nipples stiffened and began to ache he stopped then and drew her down onto his lap dany was flushed and breathless her heart fluttering in her chest he cupped her face in his huge hands and looked into his eyes no he said and she knew it was a question she took his hand and moved it down to the wetness between her thighs yes she whispered as she put his finger inside her eddard the summons came in the hour before the dawn when the world was still and grey alyn shook him roughly from his dreams and ned stumbled into the predawn chill groggy from sleep to find his horse saddled and the king already mounted robert wore thick brown gloves and a heavy fur cloak with a hood that covered his ears and looked for all the world like a bear sitting a horse up stark he roared up up we have matters of state to discuss by all means ned said come inside your grace alyn lifted the flap of the tent no no no robert said his breath steamed with every word the camp is full of ears besides i want to ride out and taste this country of yours ser boros and ser meryn waited behind him with a dozen guardsmen ned saw there was nothing to do but rub the sleep from his eyes dress and mount up robert set the pace driving his huge black destrier hard as ned galloped along beside him trying to keep up he called out a question as they rode but the wind blew his words away and the king did not hear him after that ned rode in silence they soon left the kingsroad and took off across rolling plains dark with mist by then the guard had fallen back a small distance safely out of earshot but still robert would not slow dawn broke as they crested a low ridge and finally the king pulled up by then they were miles south of the main party robert was flushed and exhilarated as ned reined up beside him gods he swore laughing it feels good to get out and tide the way a man was meant to ride i swear ned this creeping along is enough to drive a man mad he had never been a patient man robert baratheon that damnable wheelhouse the way it creaks and groans climbing every bump in the road as if it were a mountain i promise you if that wretched thing breaks another axle im going to burn it and cersei can walk ned laughed i will gladly light the torch for you good man the king clapped him on the shoulder ive half a mind to leave them all behind and just keep going page a smile touched neds lips i do believe you mean it i do i do the king said what do you say ned just you and me two vagabond knights on the kingsroad our swords at our sides and the gods know what in front of us and maybe a farmers daughter or a tavern wench to warm our beds tonight would that we could ned said but we have duties now my liege to the realm to our children i to my lady wife and you to your queen we are not the boys we were you were never the boy you were robert grumbled mores the pity and yet there was that one time what was her name that common girl of yours becca no she was one of mine gods love her black hair and these sweet big eyes you could drown in them yours was aleena no you told me once was it merryl you know the one i mean your bastards mother her name was wylla ned replied with cool courtesy and i would sooner not speak of her wylla yes the king grinned she must have been a rare wench if she could make lord eddard stark forget his honor even for an hour you never told me what she looked like neds mouth tightened in anger nor will leave it be robert for the love you say you bear me i dishonored myself and i dishonored catelyn in the sight of gods and men gods have mercy you scarcely knew catelyn i had taken her to wife she was carrying my child you are too hard on yourself ned you always were damn it no woman wants baelor the blessed in her bed he slapped a hand on his knee well ill not press you if you feel so strong about it though i swear at times youre so prickly you ought to take the hedgehog as your sigil the rising sun sent fingers of light through the pale white mists of dawn a wide plain spread out beneath them bare and brown its flatness here and there relieved by long low hummocks ned pointed them out to his king the barrows of the first men robert frowned have we ridden onto a graveyard there are barrows everywhere in the north your grace ned told him this land is old and cold robert grumbled pulling his cloak more tightly around himself the guard had reined up well behind them at the bottom of the ridge well i did not bring you out here to talk of graves or bicker about your bastard there was a rider in the night from lord varys in kings landing here the king pulled a paper from his belt and handed it to ned varys the eunuch was the kings master of whisperers he served robert now as he had once served aerys targaryen ned unrolled the paper with trepidation thinking of lysa and her terrible accusation but the message did not concern lady arryn what is the source for this information do you remember ser jorah mormont would that i might forget him ned said bluntly the mormonts of bear island were an old house proud and honorable but their lands were cold and distant and poor ser jorah had tried to swell the page family coffers by selling some poachers to a tyroshi slaver as the mormonts were bannermen to the starks his crime had dishonored the north ned had made the long journey west to bear island only to find when he arrived that jorah had taken ship beyond the reach of ice and the kings justice five years had passed since then ser jorah is now in pentos anxious to earn a royal pardon that would allow him to return from exile robert explained lord varys makes good use of him so the slaver has become a spy ned said with distaste he handed the letter back i would rather he become a corpse varys tells me that spies are more useful than corpses robert said jorah aside what do you make of his report daenerys targaryen has wed some dothraki horselord what of it shall we send her a wedding gift the king frowned a knife perhaps a good sharp one and a bold man to wield it ned did not feign surprise roberts hatred of the targaryens was a madness in him he remembered the angry words they had exchanged when tywin lannister had presented robert with the corpses of rhaegars wife and children as a token of fealty ned had named that glorge rr martin murder robert called it war when he had protested that the young prince and princess were no more than babes his newmade king had replied i see no babes only dragonspawn not even jon arryn had been able to calm that storm eddard stark had ridden out that very day in a cold rage to fight the last battles of the war alone in the south it had taken another death to reconcile them lyannas death and the grief they had shared over her passing this time ned resolved to keep his temper your grace the girl is scarcely more than a child you are no tywin lannister to slaughter innocents it was said that rhaegars little girl had cried as they dragged her from beneath her bed to face the swords the boy had been no more than a babe in arms yet lord tywins soldiers had torn him from his mothers breast and dashed his head against a wall and how long will this one remain an innocent roberts mouth grew hard this child will soon enough spread her legs and start breeding more dragonspawn to plague me nonetheless ned said the murder of children it would be vile unspeakable unspeakable the king roared what aerys did to your brother brandon was unspeakable the way your lord father died that was unspeakable and rhaegar how many times do you think he raped your sister how many hundreds of times his voice had grown so loud that his horse whinnied nervously beneath him the king jerked the reins hard quieting the animal and pointed an angry finger at ned i will kill every targaryen i can get my hands on until they are as dead as their dragons and then i will piss on their graves ned knew better than to defy him when the wrath was on him if the years had not quenched roberts thirst for revenge no words of his would help you cant get your hands on this one can you he said quietly page the kings mouth twisted in a bitter grimace no gods be cursed some poxridden pentoshi cheesemonger had her brother and her walled up on his estate with pointyhatted eunuchs all around them and now hes handed them over to the dothraki i should have had them both killed years ago when it was easy to get at them but jon was as bad as you more fool listened to him jon arryn was a wise man and a good hand robert snorted the anger was leaving him as suddenly as it had come this khal drogo is said to have a hundred thousand men in his horde what would jon say to that he would say that even a million dothraki are no threat to the realm so long as they remain on the other side of the narrow sea ned replied calmly the barbarians have no ships they hate and fear the open sea the king shifted uncomfortably in his saddle perhaps there are ships to be had in the free cities though i tell you ned i do not like this marriage there are still those in the seven kingdoms who call me usurper do you forget how many houses fought for targaryen in the war they bide their time for now but give them half a chance they will murder me in my bed and my sons with me if the beggar king crosses with a dothraki horde at his back the traitors will join him he will not cross ned promised and if by some mischance he does we will throw him back into the sea once you choose a new warden of the east the king groaned for the last time i will not name the arryn boy warden i know the boy is your nephew but with targaryens climbing in bed with dothraki i would be mad to rest one quarter of the realm on the shoulders of a sickly child ned was ready for that yet we still must have a warden of the east if robert arryn will not do name one of your brothers stannis proved himself at the siege of storms end surely he let the name hang there for a moment the king frowned and said nothing he looked uncomfortable that is ned finished quietly watching unless you have already promised the honor to another for a moment robert had the grace to look startled just as quickly the look became annoyance what if i have its jaime lannister is it not robert kicked his horse back into motion and started down the ridge toward the barrows ned kept pace with him the king rode on eyes straight ahead yes he said at last a single hard word to end the matter kingslayer ned said the rumors were true then he rode on dangerous ground now he knew an able and courageous man no doubt he said carefully but his father is warden of the west robert in time ser jaime will succeed to that honor no one man should hold both east and west he left unsaid his real concern that the appointment would put half the armies of the realm into the hands of lannisters page i will fight that battle when the enemy appears on the field the king said stubbornly at the moment lord tywin looms eternal as casterly rock so i doubt that jaime will be succeeding anytime soon dont vex me about this ned the stone has been set your grace may i speak frankly i seem unable to stop you robert grumbled they rode through tall brown grasses can you trust jaime lannister he is my wifes twin a sworn brother of the kingsguard his life and fortune and honor all bound to mine as they were bound to aerys targaryens ned pointed out why should i mistrust him he has done everything i have ever asked of him his sword helped win the throne i sit on his sword helped taint the throne you sit on ned thought but he did not permit the words to pass his lips he swore a vow to protect his kings life with his own then he opened that kings throat with a sword seven hells someone had to kill aerys robert said reining his mount to a sudden halt beside an ancient barrow if jaime hadnt done it it would have been left for you or me we were not sworn brothers of the kingsguard ned said the time had come for robert to hear the whole truth he decided then and there do you remember the trident your grace i won my crown there how should i forget it you took a wound from rhaegar ned reminded him so when the targaryen host broke and ran you gave the pursuit into my hands the remnants of rhaegars army fled back to kings landing we followed aerys was in the red keep with several thousand loyalists i expected to find the gates closed to us robert gave an impatient shake of his head instead you found that our men had already taken the city what of it not our men ned said patiently lannister men the lion of lannister flew over the ramparts not the crowned stag and they had taken the city by treachery the war had raged for close to a year lords great and small had flocked to roberts banners others had remained loyal to targaryen the mighty lannisters of casterly rock the wardens of the west had remained aloof from the struggle ignoring calls to arms from both rebels and royalists aerys targaryen must have thought that his gods had answered his prayers when lord tywin lannister appeared before the gates of kings landing with an army twelve thousand strong professing loyalty so the mad king had ordered his last mad act he had opened his city to the lions at the gate treachery was a coin the targaryens knew well robert said the anger was building in him again page lannister paid them back in kind it was no less than they deserved i shall not trouble my sleep over it you were not there ned said bitterness in his voice troubled sleep was no stranger to him he had lived his lies for fourteen years yet they still haunted him at night there was no honor in that conquest the others take your honor robert swore what did any targaryen ever know of honor go down into your crypt and ask lyanna about the dragons honor you avenged lyanna at the trident ned said halting beside the king promise me ned she had whispered that did not bring her back robert looked away off into the grey distance the gods be damned it was a hollow victory they gave me a crown it was the girl i prayed them for your sister safe and mine again as she was meant to be i ask you ned what good is it to wear a crown the gods mock the prayers of kings and cowherds alike i cannot answer for the gods your grace only for what i found when i rode into the throne room that day ned said aerys was dead on the floor drowned in his own blood his dragon skulls stared down from the walls lannisters men were everywhere jaime wore the white cloak of the kingsguard over his golden armor i can see him still even his sword was gilded he was seated on the iron throne high above his knights wearing a helm fashioned in the shape of a lions head how he glittered this is well known the king complained i was still mounted i rode the length of the hall in silence between the long rows of dragon skulls it felt as though they were watching me somehow i stopped in front of the throne looking up at him his golden sword was across his legs its edge red with a kings blood my men were filling the room behind me lannisters men drew back i never said a word i looked at him seated there on the throne and i waited at last jaime laughed and got up he took off his helm and he said to me have no fear stark i was only keeping it warm for our friend robert its not a very comfortable seat im afraid the king threw back his head and roared his laughter startled a flight of crows from the tall brown grass they took to the air in a wild beating of wings you think i should mistrust lannister because he sat on my throne for a few moments he shook with laughter again jaime was all of seventeen ned scarce more than a boy boy or man he had no right to that throne perhaps he was tired robert suggested killing kings is weary work gods know theres no place else to rest your ass in that damnable room and he spoke truly it is a monstrous uncomfortable chair in more ways than one the king shook his head well now i know jaimes dark sin and the matter can be forgotten i am heartily sick of secrets and squabbles and matters of state ned its all as tedious as counting coppers come lets ride you used to know how i want to feel the wind in my hair again he kicked his horse back into motion and galloped up over the barrow page raining earth down behind him for a moment ned did not follow he had run out of words and he was filled with a vast sense of helplessness not for the first time he wondered what he was doing here and why he had come he was no jon arryn to curb the wildness of his king and teach him wisdom robert would do what he pleased as he always had and nothing ned could say or do would change that he belonged in winterfell he belonged with catelyn in her grief and with bran a man could not always be where he belonged though resigned eddard stark put his boots into his horse and set off after the king tyrion the north went on forever tyrion lannister knew the maps as well as anyone but a fortnight on the wild track that passed for the kingsroad up here had brought home the lesson that the map was one thing and the land quite another they had left winterfell on the same day as the king amidst all the commotion of the royal departure riding out to the sound of men shouting and horses snorting to the rattle of wagons and the groaning of the queens huge wheelhouse as a light snow flurried about them the kingsroad was just beyond the sprawl of castle and town there the banners and the wagons and the columns of knights and freeriders turned south taking the tumult with them while tyrion turned north with benjen stark and his nephew it had grown colder after that and far more quiet west of the road were flint hills grey and rugged with tall watchtowers on their stony summits to the east the land was lower the ground flattening to a rolling plain that stretched away as far as the eye could see stone bridges spanned swift narrow rivers while small farms spread in rings around holdfasts walled in wood and stone the road was well trafficked and at night for their comfort there were rude inns to be found three days ride from winterfell however the farmland gave way to dense wood and the kingsroad grew lonely the flint hills rose higher and wilder with each passing mile until by the fifth day they had turned into mountains cold bluegrey giants with jagged promontories and snow on their shoulders when the wind blew from the north long plumes of ice crystals flew from the high peaks like banners with the mountains a wall to the west the road veered north by northeast through the wood a forest of oak and evergreen and black brier that seemed older and darker than any tyrion had ever seen the wolfswood benjen stark called it and indeed their nights came alive with the howls of distant packs and some not so distant jon snows albino direwolf pricked up his ears at the nightly howling but never raised his own voice in reply there was something very unsettling about that animal tyrion thought page there were eight in the party by then not counting the wolf tyrion traveled with two of his own men as befit a lannister benjen stark had only his bastard nephew and some fresh mounts for the nights watch but at the edge of the wolfswood they stayed a night behind the wooden walls of a forest holdfast and there joined up with another of the black brothers one yoren yoren was stooped and sinister his features hidden behind a beard as black as his clothing but he seemed as tough as an old root and as hard as stone with him were a pair of ragged peasant boys from the fingers rapers yoren said with a cold look at his charges tyrion understood life on the wall was said to be hard but no doubt it was preferable to castration five men three boys a direwolf twenty horses and a cage of ravens given over to benjen stark by maester luwin no doubt they made a curious fellowship for the kingsroad or any road tyrion noticed jon snow watching yoren and his sullen companions with an odd cast to his face that looked uncomfortably like dismay yoren had a twisted shoulder and a sour smell his hair and beard were matted and greasy and full of lice his clothing old patched and seldom washed his two young recruits smelled even worse and seemed as stupid as they were cruel no doubt the boy had made the mistake of thinking that the nights watch was made up of men like his uncle if so yoren and his companions were a rude awakening tyrion felt sorry for the boy he had chosen a hard life or perhaps he should say that a hard life had been chosen for him he had rather less sympathy for the uncle benjen stark seemed to share his brothers distaste for lannisters and he had not been pleased when tyrion had told him of his intentions i warn you lannister youll find no inns at the wall he had said looking down on him no doubt youll find some place to put me tyrion had replied as you might have noticed im small one did not say no to the queens brother of course so that had settled the matter but stark had not been happy you will not like the ride i promise you that hed said curtly and since the moment they set out he had done all he could to live up to that promise by the end of the first week tyrions thighs were raw from hard riding his legs were cramping badly and he was chilled to the bone he did not complain he was damned if he would give benjen stark that satisfaction he took a small revenge in the matter of his riding fur a tattered bearskin old and mustysmelling stark had offered it to him in an excess of nights watch gallantry no doubt expecting him to graciously decline tyrion had accepted with a smile he had brought his warmest clothing with him when they rode out of winterfell and soon discovered that it was nowhere near warm enough it was cold up here and growing colder the nights were well below freezing now and when the wind blew it was like a knife cutting right through his warmest woolens by now stark was no doubt regretting his chivalrous impulse perhaps he had learned a lesson the lannisters never declined graciously or otherwise the lannisters took what was offered farms and holdfasts grew scarcer and smaller as they pressed northward ever deeper into the darkness of the wolfswood until finally there were no more roofs to shelter under and they were thrown back on their own resources page tyrion was never much use in making a camp or breaking one too small too hobbled too intheway so while stark and yoren and the other men erected rude shelters tended the horses and built a fire it became his custom to take his fur and a wineskin and go off by himself to read on the eighteenth night of their journey the wine was a rare sweet amber from the summer isles that he had brought all the way north from casterly rock and the book a rumination on the history and properties of dragons with lord eddard starks permission tyrion had borrowed a few rare volumes from the winterfell library and packed them for the ride north he found a comfortable spot just beyond the noise of the camp beside a swiftrunning stream with waters clear and cold as ice a grotesquely ancient oak provided shelter from the biting wind tyrion curled up in his fur with his back against the trunk took a sip of the wine and began to read about the properties of dragonbone dragonbone is black because of its high iron content the book told him it is strong as steel yet lighter and far more flexible and of course utterly impervious to fire dragonbone bows are greatly prized by the dothraki and small wonder an archer so armed can outrange any wooden bow tyrion had a morbid fascination with dragons when he had first come to kings landing for his sisters wedding to robert baratheon he had made it a point to seek out the dragon skulls that had hung on the walls of targaryens throne room king robert had replaced them with banners and tapestries but tyrion had persisted until he found the skulls in the dank cellar where they had been stored he had expected to find them impressive perhaps even frightening he had not thought to find them beautiful yet they were as black as onyx polished smooth so the bone seemed to shimmer in the light of his torch they liked the fire he sensed hed thrust the torch into the mouth of one of the larger skulls and made the shadows leap and dance on the wall behind him the teeth were long curving knives of black diamond the flame of the torch was nothing to them they had bathed in the heat of far greater fires when he had moved away tyrion could have sworn that the beasts empty eye sockets had watched him go there were nineteen skulls the oldest was more than three thousand years old the youngest a mere century and a half the most recent were also the smallest a matched pair no bigger than mastiffs skulls and oddly misshapen all that remained of the last two hatchlings born on dragonstone they were the last of the targaryen dragons perhaps the last dragons anywhere and they had not lived very long from there the skulls ranged upward in size to the three great monsters of song and story the dragons that aegon targaryen and his sisters had unleashed on the seven kingdoms of old the singers had given them the names of gods balerion meraxes vhaghar tyrion had stood between their gaping jaws wordless and awed you could have ridden a horse down vhaghars gullet although you would not have ridden it out again meraxes was even bigger and the greatest of them balerion the black dread could have swallowed an aurochs whole or even one of the hairy mammoths said to roam the cold wastes beyond the port of ibben tyrion stood in that dank cellar for a long time staring at balerions huge emptyeyed skull until his torch burned low trying to grasp the size of the living animal to imagine how it must have looked when it spread its great black wings and swept across the skies breathing fire a gaml of thrones page his own remote ancestor king loren of the rock had tried to stand against the fire when he joined with king mern of the reach to oppose the targaryen conquest that was close on three hundred years ago when the seven kingdoms were kingdoms and not mere provinces of a greater realm between them the two kings had six hundred banners flying five thousand mounted knights and ten times as many freeriders and menatarms aegon dragonlord had perhaps a fifth that number the chroniclers said and most of those were conscripts from the ranks of the last king he had slain their loyalties uncertain the hosts met on the broad plains of the reach amidst golden fields of wheat ripe for harvest when the two kings charged the targaryen army shivered and shattered and began to run for a few moments the chroniclers wrote the conquest was at an end but only for those few moments before aegon targaryen and his sisters joined the battle it was the only time that vhaghar meraxes and balerion were all unleashed at once the singers called it the field of fire near four thousand men had burned that day among them king mern of the reach king loren had escaped and lived long enough to surrender pledge his fealty to the targaryens and beget a son for which tyrion was duly grateful why do you read so much tyrion looked up at the sound of the voice jon snow was standing a few feet away regarding him curiously he closed the book on a finger and said look at me and tell me what you see the boy looked at him suspiciously is this some kind of trick i see you tyrion lannister tyrion sighed you are remarkably polite for a bastard snow what you see is a dwarf you are what twelve fourteen the boy said fourteen and youre taller than i will ever be my legs are short and twisted and i walk with difficulty i require a special saddle to keep from falling off my horse a saddle of my own design you may be interested to know it was either that or ride a pony my arms are strong enough but again too short i will never make a swordsman had i been born a peasant they might have left me out to die or sold me to some slavers grotesquerie alas i was born a lannister of casterly rock and the grotesqueries are all the poorer things are expected of me my father was the hand of the king for twenty years my brother later killed that very same king as it turns out but life is full of these little ironies my sister married the new king and my repulsive nephew will be king after him i must do my part for the honor of my house wouldnt you agree yet how well my legs may be too small for my body but my head is too large although i prefer to think it is just large enough for my mind i have a realistic grasp of my own strengths and weaknesses my mind is my weapon my brother has his sword king robert has his warhammer and i have my mind and a mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone if it is to keep its edge tyrion tapped the leather cover of the book thats why i read so much jon snow page the boy absorbed that all in silence he had the stark face if not the name long solemn guarded a face that gave nothing away whoever his mother had been she had left little of herself in her son what are you reading about he asked dragons tyrion told him what good is that there are no more dragons the boy said with the easy certainty of youth so they say tyrion replied sad isnt it when i was your age used to dream of having a dragon of my own you did the boy said suspiciously perhaps he thought tyrion was making fun of him oh yes even a stunted twisted ugly little boy can look down over the world when hes seated on a dragons back tyrion pushed the bearskin aside and climbed to his feet i used to start fires in the bowels of casterly rock and stare at the flames for hours pretending they were dragonfire sometimes id imagine my father burning at other times my sister jon snow was staring at him a look equal parts horror and fascination tyrion guffawed dont look at me that way bastard i know your secret youve dreamt the same kind of dreams no jon snow said horrified i wouldnt no never tyrion raised an eyebrow well no doubt the starks have been terribly good to you im certain lady stark treats you as if you were one of her own and your brother robb hes always been kind and why not he gets winterfell and you get the wall and your father he must have good reasons for packing you off to the nights watch stop it jon snow said his face dark with anger the nights watch is a noble calling tyrion laughed youre too smart to believe that the nights watch is a midden heap for all the misfits of the realm ive seen you looking at yoren and his boys those are your new brothers jon snow how do you like them sullen peasants debtors poachers rapers thieves and bastards like you all wind up on the wall watching for grumkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about the good part is there are no grumkins or snarks so its scarcely dangerous work the bad part is you freeze your balls off but since youre not allowed to breed anyway i dont suppose that matters stop it the boy screamed he took a step forward his hands coiling into fists close to tears suddenly absurdly tyrion felt guilty he took a step forward intending to give the boy a reassuring pat on the shoulder or mutter some word of apology he never saw the wolf where it was or how it came at him one moment he was walking toward snow and the next he was flat on his back on the hard rocky ground the book spinning away from him as he fell the breath going out of him at the sudden impact his mouth full of dirt and blood and rotting leaves as he tried to get up his back spasmed painfully he must have wrenched it in the fall he ground his teeth in frustration grabbed a root and pulled himself back to a sitting position help me he said to the boy reaching up a hand page and suddenly the wolf was between them he did not growl the damned thing never made a sound he only looked at him with those bright red eyes and showed him his teeth and that was more than enough tyrion sagged back to the ground with a grunt dont help me then ill sit right here until you leave jon snow stroked ghosts thick white fur smiling now ask me nicely tyrion lannister felt the anger coiling inside him and crushed it out with a will it was not the first time in his life he had been humiliated and it would not be the last perhaps he even deserved this i should be very grateful for your kind assistance jon he said mildly down ghost the boy said the direwolf sat on his haunches those red eyes never left tyrion jon came around behind him slid his hands under his arms and lifted him easily to his feet then he picked up the book and handed it back why did he attack me tyrion asked with a sidelong glance at the direwolf he wiped blood and dirt from his mouth with the back of his hand maybe he thought you were a grumkin tyrion glanced at him sharply then he laughed a raw snort of amusement that came bursting out through his nose entirely without his permission oh gods he said choking on his laughter and shaking his head i suppose i do rather look like a grumkin what does he do to snarks you dont want to know jon picked up the wineskin and handed it to tyrion tyrion pulled out the stopper tilted his head and squeezed a long stream into his mouth the wine was cool fire as it trickled down his throat and warmed his belly he held out the skin to jon snow want some the boy took the skin and tried a cautious swallow its true isnt it he said when he was done what you said about the nights watch tyrion nodded jon snow set his mouth in a grim line if thats what it is thats what it is tyrion grinned at him thats good bastard most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it most men the boy said but not you no tyrion admitted not me i seldom even dream of dragons anymore there are no dragons he scooped up the fallen bearskin come we had better return to camp before your uncle calls the banners the walk was short but the ground was rough underfoot and his legs were cramping badly by the time they got back jon snow offered a hand to help him over a thick tangle of roots but tyrion shook him off he would make his own way as he had all his life still the camp was a welcome sight the shelters had been thrown up against the tumbledown wall of a longabandoned holdfast a shield against the wind page the horses had been fed and a fire had been laid yoren sat on a stone skinning a squirrel the savory smell of stew filled tyrions nostrils he dragged himself over to where his man morrec was tending the stewpot wordlessly morrec handed him the ladle tyrion tasted and handed it back more pepper he said benjen stark emerged from the shelter he shared with his nephew there you are jon damn it dont go off like that by yourself i thought the others had gotten you it was the grumkins tyrion told him laughing jon snow smiled stark shot a baffled look at yoren the old man grunted shrugged and went back to his bloody work the squirrel gave some body to the stew and they ate it with black bread and hard cheese that night around their fire tyrion shared around his skin of wine until even yoren grew mellow one by one the company drifted off to their shelters and to sleep all but jon snow who had drawn the nights first watch tyrion was the last to retire as always as he stepped into the shelter his men had built for him he paused and looked back at jon snow the boy stood near the fire his face still and hard looking deep into the flames tyrion lannister smiled sadly and went to bed catelyn ned and the girls were eight days gone when maester luwin came to her one night in brans sickroom carrying a reading lamp and the books of account it is past time that we reviewed the figures my lady he said youll want to know how much this royal visit cost us catelyn looked at bran in his sickbed and brushed his hair back off his forehead it had grown very long she realized she would have to cut it soon i have no need to look at figures maester luwin she told him never taking her eyes from bran i know what the visit cost us take the books away my lady the kings party had healthy appetites we must replenish our stores before she cut him off i said take the books away the steward will attend to our needs we have no steward maester luwin reminded her like a little grey rat she thought he would not let go poole went south to establish lord eddards household at kings landing catelyn nodded absently oh yes i remember bran looked so pale she wondered whether they might move his bed under the window so he could get the morning sun maester luwin set the lamp in a niche by the door and fiddled with its wick there are several appointments that require your immediate page attention my lady besides the steward we need a captain of the guards to fill jorys place a new master of horse her eyes snapped around and found him a master of horse her voice was a whip the maester was shaken yes my lady hullen rode south with lord eddard so my son lies here broken and dying luwin and you wish to discuss a new master of horse do you think i care what happens in the stables do you think it matters to me one whit i would gladly butcher every horse in winterfell with my own hands if it would open brans eyes do you understand that do you he bowed his head yes my lady but the appointments ill make the appointments robb said catelyn had not heard him enter but there he stood in the doorway looking at her she had been shouting she realized with a sudden flush of shame what was happening to her she was so tired and her head hurt all the time maester luwin looked from catelyn to her son i have prepared a list of those we might wish to consider for the vacant offices he said offering robb a paper plucked from his sleeve her son glanced at the names he had come from outside catelyn saw his cheeks were red from the cold his hair shaggy and windblown good men he said well talk about them tomorrow he handed back the list of names very good my lord the paper vanished into his sleeve leave us now robb said maester luwin bowed and departed robb closed the door behind him and turned to her he was wearing a sword she saw mother what are you doing catelyn had always thought robb looked like her like bran and rickon and sansa he had the tully coloring the auburn hair the blue eyes yet now for the first time she saw something of eddard stark in his face something as stern and hard as the north what am i doing she echoed puzzled how can you ask that what do you imagine im doing i am taking care of your brother i am taking care of bran is that what you call it you havent left this room since bran was hurt you didnt even come to the gate when father and the girls went south i said my farewells to them here and watched them ride out from that window she had begged ned not to go not now not after what had happened everything had changed now couldnt he see that it was no use he had no choice he had told her and then he left choosing i cant leave him even for a moment not when any moment could be his last i have to be with him if if she took her sons limp hand sliding his fingers through her own he was so frail and thin with no strength left in his hand but she could still feel the warmth of life through his skin page robbs voice softened hes not going to die mother maester luwin says the time of greatest danger has passed and what if maester luwin is wrong what if bran needs me and im not here rickon needs you robb said sharply hes only three he doesnt understand whats happening he thinks everyone has deserted him so he follows me around all day clutching my leg and crying i dont know what to do with him he paused a moment chewing on his lower lip the way hed done when he was little mother i need you too im trying but i cant i cant do it all by myself his voice broke with sudden emotion and catelyn remembered that he was only fourteen she wanted to get up and go to him but bran was still holding her hand and she could not move outside the tower a wolf began to howl catelyn trembled just for a second brans robb opened the window and let the night air into the stuffy tower room the howling grew louder it was a cold and lonely sound full of melancholy and despair dont she told him bran needs to stay warm he needs to hear them sing robb said somewhere out in winterfell a second wolf began to howl in chorus with the first then a third closer shaggydog and grey wind robb said as their voices rose and fell together you can tell them apart if you listen close catelyn was shaking it was the grief the cold the howling of the direwolves night after night the howling and the cold wind and the grey empty castle on and on they went never changing and her boy lying there broken the sweetest of her children the gentlest bran who loved to laugh and climb and dreamt of knighthood all gone now she would never hear him laugh again sobbing she pulled her hand free of his and covered her ears against those terrible howls make them stop she cried i cant stand it make them stop make them stop kill them all if you must just make them stop she didnt remember falling to the floor but there she was and robb was lifting her holding her in strong arms dont be afraid mother they would never hurt him he helped her to her narrow bed in the corner of the sickroom close your eyes he said gently rest maester luwin tells me youve hardly slept since brans fall i cant she wept gods forgive me robb i cant what if he dies while im asleep what if he dies what if he dies the wolves were still howling she screamed and held her ears again oh gods close the window if you swear to me youll sleep robb went to the window but as he reached for the shutters another sound was added to the mournful howling of the direwolves dogs he said listening all the dogs are barking theyve never done that before catelyn heard his breath catch in his throat when she looked up his face was pale in the lamplight fire he whispered fire she thought and then bran help me she said urgently sitting up help me with bran robb did not seem to hear her the library towers on fire he said page catelyn could see the flickering reddish light through the open window now she sagged with relief bran was safe the library was across the bailey there was no way the fire would reach them here thank the gods she whispered robb looked at her as if shed gone mad mother stay here ill come back as soon as the fires out he ran then she heard him shout to the guards outside the room heard them descending together in a wild rush taking the stairs two and three at a time outside there were shouts of fire in the yard screams running footsteps the whinny of frightened horses and the frantic barking of the castle dogs the howling was gone she realized as she listened to the cacophony the direwolves had fallen silent catelyn said a silent prayer of thanks to the seven faces of god as she went to the window across the bailey long tongues of flame shot from the windows of the library she watched the smoke rise into the sky and thought sadly of all the books the starks had gathered over the centuries then she closed the shutters when she turned away from the window the man was in the room with her you werent sposed to be here he muttered sourly no one was sposed to be here he was a small dirty man in filthy brown clothing and he stank of horses catelyn knew all the men who worked in their stables and he was none of them he was gaunt with limp blond hair and pale eyes deepsunk in a bony face and there was a dagger in his hand catelyn looked at the knife then at bran no she said the word stuck in her throat the merest whisper he must have heard her its a mercy he said hes dead already no catelyn said louder now as she found her voice again no you cant she spun back toward the window to scream for help but the man moved faster than she would have believed one hand clamped down over her mouth and yanked back her head the other brought the dagger up to her windpipe the stench of him was overwhelming she reached up with both hands and grabbed the blade with all her strength pulling it away from her throat she heard him cursing into her ear her fingers were slippery with blood but she would not let go of the dagger the hand over her mouth clenched more tightly shutting off her air catelyn twisted her head to the side and managed to get a piece of his flesh between her teeth she bit down hard into his palm the man grunted in pain she ground her teeth together and tore at him and all of a sudden he let go the taste of his blood filled her mouth she sucked in air and screamed and he grabbed her hair and pulled her away from him and she stumbled and went down and then he was standing over her breathing hard shaking the dagger was still clutched tightly in his right hand slick with blood you werent sposed to be here he repeated stupidly catelyn saw the shadow slip through the open door behind him there was a low rumble less than a snarl the merest whisper of a threat but he must have heard something because he started to turn just as the wolf made its leap they went down together half sprawled over catelyn where shed fallen the page wolf had him under the jaw the mans shriek lasted less than a second before the beast wrenched back its head taking out half his throat his blood felt like warm rain as it sprayed across her face the wolf was looking at her its jaws were red and wet and its eyes glowed golden in the dark room it was brans wolf she realized of course it was thank you catelyn whispered her voice faint and tiny she lifted her hand trembling the wolf padded closer sniffed at her fingers then licked at the blood with a wet rough tongue when it had cleaned all the blood off her hand it turned away silently and jumped up on brans bed and lay down beside him catelyn began to laugh hysterically that was the way they found them when robb and maester luwin and ser rodrik burst in with half the guards in winterfell when the laughter finally died in her throat they wrapped her in warm blankets and led her back to the great keep to her own chambers old nan undressed her and helped her into a scalding hot bath and washed the blood off her with a soft cloth afterward maester luwin arrived to dress her wounds the cuts in a came of thrones her fingers went deep almost to the bone and her scalp was raw and bleeding where hed pulled out a handful of hair the maester told her the pain was just starting now and gave her milk of the poppy to help her sleep finally she closed her eyes when she opened them again they told her that she had slept four days catelyn nodded and sat up in bed it all seemed like a nightmare to her now everything since brans fall a terrible dream of blood and grief but she had the pain in her hands to remind her that it was real she felt weak and lightheaded yet strangely resolute as if a great weight had lifted from her bring me some bread and honey she told her servants and take word to maester luwin that my bandages want changing they looked at her in surprise and ran to do her bidding catelyn remembered the way she had been before and she was ashamed she had let them all down her children her husband her house it would not happen again she would show these northerners how strong a tully of riverrun could be robb arrived before her food rodrik cassel came with him and her husbands ward theon greyjoy and lastly hallis mollen a muscular guardsman with a square brown beard he was the new captain of the guard robb said her son was dressed in boiled leather and ringmail she saw and a sword hung at his waist who was he catelyn asked them no one knows his name hallis mollen told her he was no man of winterfell mlady but some says they seen him here and about the castle these past few weeks one of the kings men then she said or one of the lannisters he could have waited behind when the others left page maybe hal said with all these strangers filling up winterfell of late theres no way of saying who he belonged to hed been biding in your stables greyjoy said you could smell it on him and how could he go unnoticed she said sharply hallis mollen looked abashed between the horses lord eddard took south and them we sent north to the nights watch the stalls were halfempty it were no great trick to hide from the stableboys could be hodor saw him the talk is that boys been acting queer but simple as he is hal shook his head we found where hed been sleeping robb put in he had ninety silver stags in a leather bag buried beneath the straw its good to know my sons life was not sold cheaply catelyn said bitterly hallis mollen looked at her confused begging your grace mlady you saying he was out to kill your boy greyjoy was doubtful thats madness he came for bran catelyn said he kept muttering how i wasnt supposed to be there he set the library fire thinking i would rush to put it out taking any guards with me if i hadnt been halfmad with grief it would have worked why would anyone want to kill bran robb said gods hes only a little boy helpless sleeping catelyn gave her firstborn a challenging look if you are to rule in the north you must think these things through robb answer your own question why would anyone want to kill a sleeping child before he could answer the servants returned with a plate of food fresh from the kitchen there was much more than shed asked for hot bread butter and honey and blackberry preserves a rasher of bacon and a softboiled egg a wedge of cheese a pot of mint tea and with it came maester luwin how is my son maester catelyn looked at all the food and found she had no appetite maester luwin lowered his eyes unchanged my lady it was the reply she had expected no more and no less her hands throbbed with pain as if the blade were still in her cutting deep she sent the servants away and looked back to robb do you have the answer yet someone is afraid bran might wake up robb said afraid of what he might say or do afraid of something he knows catelyn was proud of him very good she turned to the new captain of the guard we must keep bran safe if there was one killer there could be others how many guards do you want rnlady hal asked page so long as lord eddard is away my son is the master of winterfell she told him robb stood a little taller put one man in the sickroom night and day one outside the door two at the bottom of the stairs no one sees bran without my warrant or my mothers as you say mlord do it now catelyn suggested and let his wolf stay in the room with him robb added yes catelyn said and then again yes hallis mollen bowed and left the room lady stark ser rodrik said when the guardsman had gone did you chance to notice the dagger the killer used the circumstances did not allow me to examine it closely but i can vouch for its edge catelyn replied with a dry smile why do you ask we found the knife still in the villains grasp it seemed to me that it was altogether too fine a weapon for such a man so i looked at it long and hard the blade is valyrian steel the hilt dragonbone a weapon like that has no business being in the hands of such as him someone gave it to him catelyn nodded thoughtful robb close the door he looked at her strangely but did as she told him what i am about to tell you must not leave this room she told them i want your oaths on that if even part of what i suspect is true ned and my girls have ridden into deadly danger and a word in the wrong ears could mean their lives lord eddard is a second father to me said theon greyjoy i do so swear you have my oath maester luwin said and mine my lady echoed ser rodrik she looked at her son and you robb he nodded his consent my sister lysa believes the lannisters murdered her husband lord arryn the hand of the king catelyn told them it comes to me that jaime lannister did not join the hunt the day bran fell he remained here in the castle the room was deathly quiet i do not think bran fell from that tower she said into the stillness i think he was thrown page the shock was plain on their faces my lady that is a monstrous suggestion said rodrik cassel even the kingslayer would flinch at the murder of an innocent child oh would he theon greyjoy asked i wonder there is no limit to lannister pride or lannister ambition catelyn said the boy had always been surehanded in the past maester luwin said thoughtfully he knew every stone in winterfell gods robb swore his young face dark with anger if this is true he will pay for it he drew his sword and waved it in the air ill kill him myself ser rodrik bristled at him put that away the lannisters are a hundred leagues away never draw your sword unless you mean to use it how many times must i tell you foolish boy glorgl rr martin abashed robb sheathed his sword suddenly a child again catelyn said to ser rodrik i see my son is wearing steel now the old masteratarms said i thought it was time robb was looking at her anxiously past time she said winterfell may have need of all its swords soon and they had best not be made of wood theon greyjoy put a hand on the hilt of his blade and said my lady if it comes to that my house owes yours a great debt maester luwin pulled at his chain collar where it chafed against his neck all we have is conjecture this is the queens beloved brother we mean to accuse she will not take it kindly we must have proof or forever keep silent your proof is in the dagger ser rodrik said a fine blade like that will not have gone unnoticed there was only one place to find the truth of it catelyn realized someone must go to kings landing ill go robb said no she told him your place is here there must always be a stark in winterfell she looked at ser rodrik with his great white whiskers at maester luwin in his grey robes at young greyjoy lean and dark and impetuous who to send who would be believed then she knew catelyn struggled to push back the blankets her bandaged fingers as stiff and unyielding as stone she climbed out of bed i must go myself my lady said maester luwin is that wise surely the lannisters would greet your arrival with suspicion what about bran robb asked the poor boy looked utterly confused now you cant mean to leave him page i have done everything i can for bran she said laying a wounded hand on his arm his life is in the hands of the gods and maester luwin as you reminded me yourself robb i have other children to think of now you will need a strong escort my lady theon said ill send hal with a squad of guardsmen robb said no catelyn said a large party attracts unwelcome attention i would not have the lannisters know i am coming ser rodrik protested my lady let me accompany you at least the kingsroad can be perilous for a woman alone i will not be taking the kingsroad catelyn replied she thought for a moment then nodded her consent two riders can move as fast as one and a good deal faster than a long column burdened by wagons and wheelhouses i will welcome your company ser rodrik we will follow the white knife down to the sea and hire a ship at white harbor strong horses and brisk winds should bring us to kings landing well ahead of ned and the lannisters and then she thought we shall see what we shall see sansa eddard stark had left before dawn septa mordane informed sansa as they broke their fast the king sent for him another hunt i do believe there are still wild aurochs in these lands i am told ive never seen an aurochs sansa said feeding a piece of bacon to lady under the table the direwolf took it from her hand as delicate as a queen septa mordane sniffed in disapproval a noble lady does not feed dogs at her table she said breaking off another piece of comb and letting the honey drip down onto her bread shes not a dog shes a direwolf sansa pointed out as lady licked her fingers with a rough tongue anyway father said we could keep them with us if we want the septa was not appeased youre a good girl sansa but i do vow when it comes to that creature youre as willful as your sister arya she scowled and where is arya this morning she wasnt hungry sansa said knowing full well that her sister had probably stolen down to the kitchen hours ago and wheedled a breakfast out of some cooks boy do remind her to dress nicely today the grey velvet perhaps we are all invited to ride with the queen and princess myrcella in the royal wheelhouse and we must look our best page sansa already looked her best she had brushed out her long auburn hair until it shone and picked her nicest blue silks she had been looking forward to today for more than a week it was a great honor to ride with the queen and besides prince joffrey might be there her betrothed just thinking it made her feel a strange fluttering inside even though they were not to marry for years and years sansa did not really know joffrey yet but she was already in love with him he was all she ever dreamt her prince should be tall and handsome and strong with hair like gold she treasured every chance to spend time with him few as they were the only thing that scared her about today was arya arya had a way of ruining everything you never knew what she would do ill tell her sansa said uncertainly but shell dress the way she always does she hoped it wouldnt be too embarrassing may i be excused you may septa mordane helped herself to more bread and honey and sansa slid from the bench lady followed at her heels as she ran from the inns common room outside she stood for a moment amidst the shouts and curses and the creak of wooden wheels as the men broke down the tents and pavilions and loaded the wagons for another days march the inn was a sprawling threestory structure of pale stone the biggest that sansa had ever seen but even so it had accommodations for less than a third of the kings party which had swollen to more than four hundred with the addition of her fathers household and the freeriders who had joined them on the road she found arya on the banks of the trident trying to hold nymeria still while she brushed dried mud from her fur the direwolf was not enjoying the process arya was wearing the same riding leathers she had worn yesterday and the day before you better put on something pretty sansa told her septa mordane said so were traveling in the queens wheelhouse with princess myrcella today im not arya said trying to brush a tangle out of nymerias matted grey fur mycah and i are going to ride upstream and look for rubies at the ford rubies sansa said lost what rubies arya gave her a look like she was so stupid rhaegars rubies this is where king robert killed him and won the crown sansa regarded her scrawny little sister in disbelief you cant look for rubies the princess is expecting us the queen invited us both i dont care arya said the wheelhouse doesnt even have windows you cant see a thing what could you want to see sansa said annoyed she had been thrilled by the invitation and her stupid sister was going to ruin everything just as shed feared its all just fields and farms and holdfasts it is not arya said stubbornly if you came with us sometimes youd see i hate riding sansa said fervently all it does is get you soiled and dusty and sore arya shrugged hold still she snapped at nymeria im not hurting you then to sansa she said when we were crossing the neck i counted thirtysix flowers i never saw before and mycah showed me a lizardlion page sansa shuddered they had been twelve days crossing the neck rumbling down a crooked causeway through an endless black bog and she had hated every moment of it the air had been damp and clammy the causeway so narrow they could not even make proper camp at night they had to stop right on the kingsroad dense thickets of halfdrowned trees pressed close around them branches dripping with curtains of pale fungus huge flowers bloomed in the mud and floated on pools of stagnant water but if you were stupid enough to leave the causeway to pluck them there were quicksands waiting to suck you down and snakes watching from the trees and lizardlions floating halfsubmerged in the water like black logs with eyes and teeth none of which stopped arya of course one day she came back grinning her horsey grin her hair all tangled and her clothes covered in mud clutching a raggedy bunch of purple and green flowers for father sansa kept hoping he would tell arya to behave herself and act like the highborn lady she was supposed to be but he never did he only hugged her and thanked her for the flowers that just made her worse then it turned out the purple flowers were called poison kisses and arya got a rash on her arms sansa would have thought that might have taught her a lesson but arya laughed about it and the next day she rubbed mud all over her arms like some ignorant bog woman just because her friend mycah told her it would stop the itching she had bruises on her arms and shoulders too dark purple welts and faded greenandyellow splotches sansa had seen them when her sister undressed for sleep how she had gotten those only the seven gods knew arya was still going on brushing out nymerias tangles and chattering about things shed seen on the trek south last week we found this haunted watchtower and the day before we chased a herd of wild horses you should have seen them run when they caught a scent of nymeria the wolf wriggled in her grasp and arya scolded her stop that i have to do the other side youre all muddy youre not supposed to leave the column sansa reminded her father said so arya shrugged i didnt go far anyway nymeria was with me the whole time i dont always go off either sometimes its fun just to ride along with the wagons and talk to people sansa knew all about the sorts of people arya liked to talk to squires and grooms and serving girls old men and naked children roughspoken freeriders of uncertain birth arya would make friends with anybody this mycah was the worst a butchers boy thirteen and wild he slept in the meat wagon and smelled of the slaughtering block just the sight of him was enough to make sansa feel sick but arya seemed to prefer his company to hers sansa was running out of patience now you have to come with me she told her sister firmly you cant refuse the queen septa mordane will expect you arya ignored her she gave a hard yank with the brush nymeria growled and spun away affronted come back here theres going to be lemon cakes and tea sansa went on all adult and reasonable lady brushed against her leg sansa scratched her ears the way she liked and lady sat beside her on her haunches page watching arya chase nymeria why would you want to ride a smelly old horse and get all sore and sweaty when you could recline on feather pillows and eat cakes with the queen i dont like the queen arya said casually sansa sucked in her breath shocked that even arya would say such a thing but her sister prattled on heedless she wont even let me bring nymeria she thrust the brush under her belt and stalked her wolf nymeria watched her approach warily a royal wheelhouse is no place for a wolf sansa said and princess myrcella is afraid of them you know that myrcella is a little baby arya grabbed nymeria around her neck but the moment she pulled out the brush again the direwolf wriggled free and bounded off frustrated arya threw down the brush bad wolf she shouted sansa couldnt help but smile a little the kennelmaster once told her that an animal takes after its master she gave lady a quick little hug lady licked her cheek sansa giggled arya heard and whirled around glaring i dont care what you say im going out riding her long horsey face got the stubborn look that meant she was going to do something willful gods be true arya sometimes you act like such a child sansa said ill go by myself then it will be ever so much nicer that way lady and i will eat all the lemon cakes and just have the best time without you she turned to walk off but arya shouted after her they wont let you bring lady either she was gone before sansa could think of a reply chasing nymeria along the river alone and humiliated sansa took the long way back to the inn where she knew septa mordane would be waiting lady padded quietly by her side she was almost in tears all she wanted was for things to be nice and pretty the way they were in the songs why couldnt arya be sweet and delicate and kind like princess myrcella she would have liked a sister like that sansa could never understand how two sisters born only two years apart could be so different it would have been easier if arya had been a bastard like their half brother jon she even looked like jon with the long face and brown hair of the starks and nothing of their lady mother in her face or her coloring and jons mother had been common or so people whispered once when she was littler sansa had even asked mother if perhaps there hadnt been some mistake perhaps the grumkins had stolen her real sister but mother had only laughed and said no arya was her daughter and sansas trueborn sister blood of their blood sansa could not think why mother would want to lie about it so she supposed it had to be true as she neared the center of camp her distress was quickly forgotten a crowd had gathered around the queens wheelhouse sansa heard excited voices buzzing like a hive of bees the doors had been thrown open she saw and the queen stood at the top of the wooden steps smiling down at someone she heard her saying the council does us great honor my good lords whats happening she asked a squire she knew the council sent riders from kings landing to escort us the rest of the way he told her an honor guard for the king page anxious to see sansa let lady clear a path through the crowd people moved aside hastily for the direwolf when she got closer she saw two knights kneeling before the queen in armor so fine and gorgeous that it made her blink one knight wore an intricate suit of white enameled scales brilliant as a field of newfallen snow with silver chasings and clasps that glittered in the sun when he removed his helm sansa saw that he was an old man with hair as pale as his armor yet he seemed strong and graceful for all that from his shoulders hung the pure white cloak of the kingsguard his companion was a man near twenty whose armor was steel plate of a deep forestgreen he was the handsomest man sansa had ever set eyes upon tall and powerfully made with jetblack hair that fell to his shoulders and framed a cleanshaven face and laughing green eyes to match his armor cradled under one arm was an antlered helm its magnificent rack shimmering in gold at first sansa did not notice the third stranger he did not kneel with the others he stood to one side beside their horses a gaunt grim man who watched the proceedings in silence his face was pockmarked and beardless with deepset eyes and hollow cheeks though he was not an old man only a few wisps of hair remained to him sprouting above his ears but those he had grown long as a womans his armor was irongrey chainmail over layers of boiled leather plain and unadorned and it spoke of age and hard use above his right shoulder the stained leather hilt of the blade strapped to his back was visible a twohanded greatsword too long to be worn at his side the king is gone hunting but i know he will be pleased to see you when he returns the queen was saying to the two knights who knelt before her but sansa could not take her eyes off the third man he seemed to feel the weight of her gaze slowly he turned his head lady growled a terror as overwhelming as anything sansa stark had ever felt filled her suddenly she stepped backward and bumped into someone strong hands grasped her by the shoulders and for a moment sansa thought it was her father but when she turned it was the burned face of sandor clegane looking down at her his mouth twisted in a terrible mockery of a smile you are shaking girl he said his voice rasping do i frighten you so much he did and had since she had first laid eyes on the ruin that fire had made of his face though it seemed to her now that he was not half so terrifying as the other still sansa wrenched away from him and the hound laughed and lady moved between them rumbling a warning sansa dropped to her knees to wrap her arms around the wolf they were all gathered around gaping she could feel their eyes on her and here and there she heard muttered comments and titters of laughter a wolf a man said and someone else said seven hells thats a direwolf and the first man said whats it doing in camp and the hounds rasping voice replied the starks use them for wet nurses and sansa realized that the two stranger knights were looking down on her and lady swords in their hands and then she was frightened again and ashamed tears filled her eyes page she heard the queen say joffrey go to her and her prince was there leave her alone joffrey said he stood over her beautiful in blue wool and black leather his golden curls shining in the sun like a crown he gave her his hand drew her to her feet what is it sweet lady why are you afraid no one will hurt you put away your swords all of you the wolf is her little pet thats all he looked at sandor clegane and you dog away with you youre scaring my betrothed the hound ever faithful bowed and slid away quietly through the press sansa struggled to steady herself she felt like such a fool she was a stark of winterfell a noble lady and someday she would be a queen it was not him my sweet prince she tried to explain it was the other one the two stranger knights exchanged a look payne chuckled the young man in the green armor the older man in white spoke to sansa gently ofttimes ser ilyn frightens me as well sweet lady he has a fearsome aspect as well he should the queen had descended from the wheelhouse the spectators parted to make way for her if the wicked do not fear the mngs justice you have put the wrong man in the office sansa finally found her words then surely you have chosen the right one your grace she said and a gale of laughter erupted all around her well spoken child said the old man in white as befits the daughter of eddard stark i am honored to know you however irregular the manner of our meeting i am ser barristan selmy of the kingsguard he bowed sansa knew the name and now the courtesies that septa mordane had taught her over the years came back to her the lord commander of the kingsguard she said and councillor to robert our king and to aerys targaryen before him the honor is mine good knight even in the far north the singers praise the deeds of barristan the bold the green knight laughed again barristan the old you mean dont flatter him too sweetly child he thinks overmuch of himself already he smiled at her now wolf girl if you can put a name to me as well then i must concede that you are truly our hands daughter joffrey stiffened beside her have a care how you address my betrothed can answer sansa said quickly to quell her princes anger she smiled at the green knight your helmet bears golden antlers my lord the stag is the sigil of the royal house king robert has two brothers by your extreme youth you can only be renly baratheon lord of storms end and councillor to the king and so i name you ser barristan chuckled by his extreme youth he can only be a prancing jackanapes and so i name him there was general laughter led by lord renly himself the tension of a few moments ago was gone and sansa was beginning to feel comfortable until ser ilyn payne shouldered two men aside and page stood before her unsmiling he did not say a word lady bared her teeth and began to growl a low rumble full of menace but this time sansa silenced the wolf with a gentle hand to the head i am sorry if i offended you ser ilyn she said she waited for an answer but none came as the headsman looked at her his pale colorless eyes seemed to strip the clothes away from her and then the skin leaving her soul naked before him still silent he turned and walked away sansa did not understand she looked at her prince did i say something wrong your grace why will he not speak to me ser ilyn has not been feeling talkative these past fourteen years lord renly commented with a sly smile joffrey gave his uncle a look of pure loathing then took sansas hands in his own aerys targaryen had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers he speaks most eloquently with his sword however the queen said and his devotion to our realm is unquestioned then she smiled graciously and said sansa the good councillors and i must speak together until the king returns with your father i fear we shall have to postpone your day with myrcella please give your sweet sister my apologies joffrey perhaps you would be so kind as to entertain our guest today it would be my pleasure mother joffrey said very formally he took her by the arm and led her away from the wheelhouse and sansas spirits took flight a whole day with her prince she gazed at joffrey worshipfully he was so gallant she thought the way he had rescued her from ser ilyn and the hound why it was almost like the songs like the time serwyn of the mirror shield saved the princess daeryssa from the giants or prince aemon the dragonknight championing queen naeryss honor against evil ser morgils slanders the touch of joffreys hand on her sleeve made her heart beat faster what would you like to do be with you sansa thought but she said whatever youd like to do my prince jofftey reflected a moment we could go riding oh i love riding sansa said joffrey glanced back at lady who was following at their heels your wolf is liable to frighten the horses and my dog seems to frighten you let us leave them both behind and set off on our own what do you say sansa hesitated if you like she said uncertainly i suppose i could tie lady up she did not quite understand though i didnt know you had a dog joffrey laughed hes my mothers dog in truth she has set him to guard me and so he does you mean the hound she said she wanted to hit herself for being so slow her prince would never love her if she seemed stupid is it safe to leave him behind page prince joffrey looked annoyed that she would even ask have no fear lady i am almost a man grown and i dont fight with wood like your brothers all i need is this he drew his sword and showed it to her a longsword adroitly shrunken to suit a boy of twelve gleaming blue steel castleforged and doubleedged with a leather grip and a lionshead pommel in gold sansa exclaimed over it admiringly and joffrey looked pleased i call it lions tooth he said and so they left her direwolf and his bodyguard behind them while they ranged east along the north bank of the trident with no company save lions tooth it was a glorious day a magical day the air was warm and heavy with the scent of flowers and the woods here had a gentle beauty that sansa had never seen in the north prince joffreys mount was a blood bay courser swift as the wind and he rode it with reckless abandon so fast that sansa was hardpressed to keep up on her mare it was a day for adventures they explored the caves by the riverbank and tracked a shadowcat to its lair and when they grew hungry joffrey found a holdfast by its smoke and told them to fetch food and wine for their prince and his lady they dined on trout fresh from the river and sansa drank more wine than she had ever drunk before my father only lets us have one cup and only at feasts she confessed to her prince my betrothed can drink as much as she wants joffrey said refilling her cup they went more slowly after they had eaten joffrey sang for her as they rode his voice high and sweet and pure sansa was a little dizzy from the wine shouldnt we be starting back she asked soon joffrey said the battleground is right up ahead where the river bends that was where my father killed rhaegar targaryen you know he smashed in his chest crunch right through the armor joffrey swung an imaginary warhammer to show her how it was done then my uncle jaime killed old aerys and my father was king whats that sound sansa heard it too floating through the woods a kind of wooden clattering snack snack snack i dont know she said it made her nervous though joffrey lets go back i want to see what it is joffrey turned his horse in the direction of the sounds and sansa had no choice but to follow the noises grew louder and more distinct the clack of wood on wood and as they grew closer they heard heavy breathing as well and now and then a grunt someones there sansa said anxiously she found herself thinking of lady wishing the direwolf was with her youre safe with me joffrey drew his lions tooth from its sheath the sound of steel on leather made her tremble this way he said riding through a stand of trees beyond in a clearing overlooking the river they came upon a boy and a girl playing at knights their swords were wooden sticks broom handles from the look of them and they were rushing across the grass swinging at each other lustily the boy was years older a head taller and much stronger and he was pressing the attack the girl a scrawny thing in soiled leathers was dodging and managing to get her stick in the way of most of the boys blows but not all when she tried to lunge at him he caught her page stick with his own swept it aside and slid his wood down hard on her fingers she cried out and lost her weapon prince joffrey laughed the boy looked around wideeyed and startled and dropped his stick in the grass the girl glared at them sucking on her knuckles to take the sting out and sansa was horrified arya she called out incredulously go away arya shouted back at them angry tears in her eyes what are you doing here leave us alone joffrey glanced from arya to sansa and back again your sister she nodded blushing joffrey examined the boy an ungainly lad with a coarse freckled face and thick red hair and who are you boy he asked in a commanding tone that took no notice of the fact that the other was a year his senior mycah the boy muttered he recognized the prince and averted his eyes miord hes the butchers boy sansa said hes my friend arya said sharply you leave him alone a butchers boy who wants to be a knight is it joffrey swung down from his mount sword in hand pick up your sword butchers boy he said his eyes bright with amusement let us see how good you are mycah stood there frozen with fear joffrey walked toward him go on pick it up or do you only fight little girls she ast me to mlord mycah said she ast me to sansa had only to glance at arya and see the flush on her sisters face to know the boy was telling the truth but joffrey was in no mood to listen the wine had made him wild are you going to pick up your sword mycah shook his head its only a stick mlord its not no sword its only a stick and youre only a butchers boy and no knight joffrey lifted lions tooth and laid its point on mycahs cheek below the eye as the butchers boy stood trembling that was my ladys sister you were hitting do you know that a bright bud of blood blossomed where his sword pressed into mycahs flesh and a slow red line trickled down the boys cheek stop it arya screamed she grabbed up her fallen stick sansa was afraid arya you stay out of this i wont hurt him much prince joffrey told arya never taking his eyes off the butchers boy arya went for him page sansa slid off her mare but she was too slow arya swung with both hands there was a loud crack as the wood split against the back of the princes head and then everything happened at once before sansas horrified eyes joffrey staggered and whirled around roaring curses mycah ran for the trees as fast as his legs would take him arya swung at the prince again but this time joffrey caught the blow on lions tooth and sent her broken stick flying from her hands the back of his head was all bloody and his eyes were on fire sansa was shrieking no no stop it stop it both of you youre spoiling it but no one was listening arya scooped up a rock and hurled it at joffreys head she hit his horse instead and the blood bay reared and went galloping off after mycah stop it dont stop it sansa screamed joffrey slashed at arya with his sword screaming obscenities terrible words filthy words arya darted back frightened now but joffrey followed hounding her toward the woods backing her up against a tree sansa didnt know what to do she watched helplessly almost blind from her tears then a grey blur flashed past her and suddenly nymeria was there leaping jaws closing around joffteys sword arm the steel fell from his fingers as the wolf knocked him off his feet and they rolled in the grass the wolf snarling and ripping at him the prince shrieking in pain get it off he screamed get it off aryas voice cracked like a whip nymefia the direwolf let go of joffrey and moved to aryas side the prince lay in the grass whimpering cradling his mangled arm his shirt was soaked in blood arya said she didnt hurt you much she picked up lions tooth where it had fallen and stood over him holding the sword with both hands jofftey made a scared whimpery sound as he looked up at her no he said dont hurt me ill tell my mother you leave him alone sansa screamed at her sister arya whirled and heaved the sword into the air putting her whole body into the throw the blue steel flashed in the sun as the sword spun out over the river it hit the water and vanished with a splash joffrey moaned arya ran off to her horse nymeria loping at her heels after they had gone sansa went to prince joffrey his eyes were closed in pain his breath ragged sansa knelt beside him joffrey she sobbed oh look what they did look what they did my poor prince dont be afraid ill ride to the holdfast and bring help for you tenderly she reached out and brushed back his soft blond hair his eyes snapped open and looked at her and there was nothing but loathing there nothing but the vilest contempt then go he spit at her and dont touch me eddard theyve found her my lord ned rose quickly our men or lannisters page tit was jory his steward vayon poole replied shes not been harmed thank the gods ned said his men had been searching for arya for four days now but the queens men had been out hunting as well where is she tell jory to bring her here at once i am sorry my lord poole told him the guards on the gate were lannister men and they informed the queen when jory brought her in shes being taken directly before the king damn that woman ned said striding to the door find sansa and bring her to the audience chamber her voice may be needed he descended the tower steps in a red rage he had led searches himself for the first three days and had scarcely slept an hour since arya had disappeared this morning he had been so heartsick and weary he could scarcely stand but now his fury was on him filling him with strength men called out to him as he crossed the castle yard but ned ignored them in his haste he would have run but he was still the kings hand and a hand must keep his dignity he was aware of the eyes that followed him of the muttered voices wondering what he would do the castle was a modest holding a half days ride south of the trident the royal party had made themselves the uninvited guests of its lord ser raymun darry while the hunt for arya and the butchers boy was conducted on both sides of the river they were not welcome visitors ser raymun lived under the kings peace but his family had fought beneath rhaegars dragon banners at the trident and his three older brothers had died there a truth neither robert nor ser raymun had forgotten with kings men darry men lannister men and stark men all crammed into a castle far too small for them tensions burned hot and heavy the king had appropriated ser raymuns audience chamber and that was where ned found them the room was crowded when he burst in too crowded he thought left alone he and robert might have been able to settle the matter amicably robert was slumped in darrys high seat at the far end of the room his face closed and sullen cersei lannister and her son stood beside him the queen had her hand on joffreys shoulder thick silken bandages still covered the boys arm arya stood in the center of the room alone but for jory cassel every eye upon her arya ned called loudly he went to her his boots ringing on the stone floor when she saw him she cried out and began to sob ned went to one knee and took her in his arms she was shaking im sorry she sobbed im sorry im sorry i know he said she felt so tiny in his arms nothing but a scrawny little girl it was hard to see how she had caused so much trouble are you hurt no her face was dirty and her tears left pink tracks down her cheeks hungry some i ate some berries but there was nothing else well feed you soon enough ned promised he rose to face the king what is the meaning of this page his eyes swept the room searching for friendly faces but for his own men they were few enough ser raymun darry guarded his look well lord renly wore a half smile that might mean anything and old ser barristan was grave the rest were lannister men and hostile their only good fortune was that both jaime lannister and sandor clegane were missing leading searches north of the trident why was i not told that my daughter had been found ned demanded his voice ringing why was she not brought to me at once he spoke to robert but it was cersei lannister who answered how dare you speak to your king in that manner at that the king stirred quiet woman he snapped he straightened in his seat i am sorry ned i never meant to frighten the girl it seemed best to bring her here and get the business done with quickly and what business is that ned put ice in his voice the queen stepped forward you know full well stark this girl of yours attacked my son her and her butchers boy that animal of hers tried to tear his arm off thats not true arya said loudly she just bit him a little he was hurting mycah joff told us what happened the queen said you and the butcher boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him thats not how it was arya said close to tears again ned put a hand on her shoulder yes it is prince joffrey insisted they all attacked me and she threw lions tooth in the river ned noticed that he did not so much as glance at arya as he spoke liar arya yelled shut up the prince yelled back enough the king roared rising from his seat his voice thick with irritation silence fell he glowered at arya through his thick beard now child you will tell me what happened tell it all and tell it true it is a great crime to lie to a king then he looked over at his son when she is done you will have your turn until then hold your tongue as arya began her story ned heard the door open behind him he glanced back and saw vayon poole enter with sansa they stood quietly at the back of the hall as arya spoke when she got to the part where she threw joffreys sword into the middle of the trident renly baratheon began to laugh the king bristled ser barristan escort my brother from the hall before he chokes lord renly stifled his laughter my brother is too kind i can find the door myself he bowed to joffrey perchance later youll tell me how a nineyearold girl the size of a wet rat managed to disarm you with a broom handle and throw your sword in the river as the door swung shut behind him ned heard him say lions tooth and guffaw once more page prince joffrey was pale as he began his very different version of events when his son was done talking the king rose heavily from his seat looking like a man who wanted to be anywhere but here what in all the seven hells am i supposed to make of this he says one thing she says another they were not the only ones present ned said sansa come here ned had heard her version of the story the night arya had vanished he knew the truth tell us what happened his eldest daughter stepped forward hesitantly she was dressed in blue velvets trimmed with white a silver chain around her neck her thick auburn hair had been brushed until it shone she blinked at her sister then at the young prince i dont know she said tearfully looking as though she wanted to bolt i dont remember everything happened so fast i didnt see you rotten arya shrieked she flew at her sister like an arrow knocking sansa down to the ground pummeling her liar liar liar liar arya stop it ned shouted jory pulled her off her sister kicking sansa was pale and shaking as ned lifted her back to her feet are you hurt he asked but she was staring at arya and she did not seem to hear the girl is as wild as that filthy animal of hers cersei lannister said robert i want her punished seven hells robert swore cersei look at her shes a child what would you have me do whip her through the streets damn it children fight its over no lasting harm was done the queen was furious joff will carry those scars for the rest of his life robert baratheon looked at his eldest son so he will perhaps they will teach him a lesson ned see that your daughter is disciplined i will do the same with my son gladly your grace ned said with vast relief robert started to walk away but the queen was not done and what of the direwolf she called after him what of the beast that savaged your son the king stopped turned back frowned id forgotten about the damned wolf ned could see arya tense in jorys arms jory spoke up quickly we found no trace of the direwolf your grace robert did not look unhappy no so be it the queen raised her voice a hundred golden dragons to the man who brings me its skin a costly pelt robert grumbled i want no part of this woman you can damn well buy your furs with lannister gold the queen regarded him coolly i had not thought you so niggardly the king id thought to wed would page have laid a wolfskin across my bed before the sun went down roberts face darkened with anger that would be a fine trick without a wolf we have a wolf cersei lannister said her voice was very quiet but her green eyes shone with triumph it took them all a moment to comprehend her words but when they did the king shrugged irritably as you will have ser ilyn see to it robert you cannot mean this ned protested the king was in no mood for more argument enough ned i will hear no more a direwolf is a savage beast sooner or later it would have turned on your girl the same way the other did on my son get her a dog shell be happier for it that was when sansa finally seemed to comprehend her eyes were frightened as they went to her father he doesnt mean lady does he she saw the truth on his face no she said no not lady lady didnt bite anybody shes good lady wasnt there arya shouted angrily you leave her alone stop them sansa pleaded dont let them do it please please it wasnt lady it was nymeria arya did it you cant it wasnt lady dont let them hurt lady ill make her be good i promise i promise she started to cry all ned could do was take her in his arms and hold her while she wept he looked across the room at robert his old friend closer than any brother please robert for the love you bear me for the love you bore my sister please the king looked at them for a long moment then turned his eyes on his wife damn you cersei he said with loathing ned stood gently disengaging himself from sansas grasp all the weariness of the past four days had returned to him do it yourself then robert he said in a voice cold and sharp as steel at least have the courage to do it yourself robert looked at ned with flat dead eyes and left without a word his footsteps heavy as lead silence filled the hall where is the direwolf cersei lannister asked when her husband was gone beside her prince joffrey was smiling the beast is chained up outside the gatehouse your grace ser barristan selmy answered reluctantly send for ilyn payne no ned said jory take the girls back to their rooms and bring me ice the words tasted of bile in his throat but he forced them out if it must be done i will do it page cersei lannister regarded him suspiciously you stark is this some trick why would you do such a thing they were all staring at him but it was sansas look that cut she is of the north she deserves better than a butcher he left the room with his eyes burning and his daughters wails echoing in his ears and found the direwolf pup where they chained her ned sat beside her for a while lady he said tasting the name he had never paid much attention to the names the children had picked but looking at her now he knew that sansa had chosen well she was the smallest of the litter the prettiest the most gentle and trusting she looked at him with bright golden eyes and he ruffled her thick grey fur shortly jory brought him ice when it was over he said choose four men and have them take the body north bury her at winterfell all that way jory said astonished all that way ned affirmed the lannister woman shall never have this skin he was walking back to the tower to give himself up to sleep at last when sandor clegane and his riders came pounding through the castle gate back from their hunt there was something slung over the back of his destrier a heavy shape wrapped in a bloody cloak no sign of your daughter hand the hound rasped down but the day was not wholly wasted we got her little pet he reached back and shoved the burden off and it fell with a thump in front of ned bending ned pulled back the cloak dreading the words he would have to find for arya but it was not nymeria after all it was the butchers boy mycah his body covered in dried blood he had been cut almost in half from shoulder to waist by some terrible blow struck from above you rode him down ned said the hounds eyes seemed to glitter through the steel of that hideous dogshead helm he ran he looked at neds face and laughed but not very fast bran it seemed as though he had been falling for years fly a voice whispered in the darkness but bran did not know thow to fly so all he could do was fall maester luwin made a little boy of clay baked him till he was hard and brittle dressed him in brans clothes and flung him off a roof bran remembered the way he shattered but i never fall he said falling page the ground was so far below him he could barely make it out through the grey mists that whirled around him but he could feel how fast he was falling and he knew what was waiting for him down there even in dreams you could not fall forever he would wake up in the instant before he hit the ground he knew you always woke up in the instant before you hit the ground and if you dont the voice asked the ground was closer now still far far away a thousand miles away but closer than it had been it was cold here in the darkness there was no sun no stars only the ground below coming up to smash him and the grey mists and the whispering voice he wanted to cry not cry fly i cant fly bran said i cant i cant how do you know have you ever tried the voice was high and thin bran looked around to see where it was coming from a crow was spiraling down with him just out of reach following him as he fell help me he said im trying the crow replied say got any corn bran reached into his pocket as the darkness spun dizzily around him when he pulled his hand out golden kernels slid from between his fingers into the air they fell with him the crow landed on his hand and began to eat are you really a crow bran asked are you really falling the crow asked back its just a dream bran said is it asked the crow ill wake up when i hit the ground bran told the bird youll die when you hit the ground the crow said it went back to eating corn bran looked down he could see mountains now their peaks white with snow and the silver thread of rivers in dark woods he closed his eyes and began to cry that wont do any good the crow said i told you the answer is flying not crying how hard can it be im doing it the crow took to the air and flapped around brans hand you have wings bran pointed out page maybe you do too bran felt along his shoulders groping for feathers there are different kinds of wings the crow said bran was staring at his arms his legs he was so skinny just skin stretched taut over bones had he always been so thin he tried to remember a face swam up at him out of the grey mist shining with light golden the things i do for love it said bran screamed the crow took to the air cawing not that it shrieked at him forget that you do not need it now put it aside put it away it landed on brans shoulder and pecked at him and the shining golden face was gone bran was falling faster than ever the grey mists howled around him as he plunged toward the earth below what are you doing to me he asked the crow tearful teaching you how to fly i cant fly youre flying tight now fm falling every flight begins with a fall the crow said look down im afraid lookdown bran looked down and felt his insides turn to water the ground was rushing up at him now the whole world was spread out below him a tapestry of white and brown and green he could see everything so clearly that for a moment he forgot to be afraid he could see the whole realm and everyone in it he saw winterfell as the eagles see it the tall towers looking squat and stubby from above the castle walls just lines in the dirt he saw maester luwin on his balcony studying the sky through a polished bronze tube and frowning as he made notes in a book he saw his brother robb taller and stronger than he remembered him practicing swordplay in the yard with real steel in his hand he saw hodor the simple giant from the stables carrying an anvil to mikkens forge hefting it onto his shoulder as easily as another man might heft a bale of hay at the heart of the godswood the great white weirwood brooded over its reflection in the black pool its leaves rustling in a chill wind when it felt bran watching it lifted its eyes from the still waters and stared back at him knowingly he looked east and saw a galley racing across the waters of the bite he saw his mother sitting alone in a cabin looking at a bloodstained knife on a table in front of her as the rowers pulled at their oars and page ser rodrik leaned across a rail shaking and heaving a storm was gathering ahead of them a vast dark roaring lashed by lightning but somehow they could not see it he looked south and saw the great bluegreen rush of the trident he saw his father pleading with the king his face etched with grief he saw sansa crying herself to sleep at night and he saw arya watching in silence and holding her secrets hard in her heart there were shadows all around them one shadow was dark as ash with the terrible face of a hound another was armored like the sun golden and beautiful over them both loomed a giant in armor made of stone but when he opened his visor there was nothing inside but darkness and thick black blood he lifted his eyes and saw clear across the narrow sea to the free cities and the green dothraki sea and beyond to vaes dothrak under its mountain to the fabled lands of the jade sea to asshai by the shadow where dragons stirred beneath the sunrise finally he looked north he saw the wall shining like blue crystal and his bastard brother jon sleeping alone in a cold bed his skin growing pale and hard as the memory of all warmth fled from him and he looked past the wall past endless forests cloaked in snow past the frozen shore and the great bluewhite rivers of ice and the dead plains where nothing grew or lived north and north and north he looked to the curtain of light at the end of the world and then beyond that curtain he looked deep into the heart of winter and then he cried out afraid and the heat of his tears burned on his cheeks now you know the crow whispered as it sat on his shoulder now you know why you must live why bran said not understanding falling falling because winter is coming bran looked at the crow on his shoulder and the crow looked back it had three eyes and the third eye was full of a terrible knowledge bran looked down there was nothing below him now but snow and cold and death a frozen wasteland where jagged bluewhite spires of ice waited to embrace him they flew up at him like spears he saw the bones of a thousand other dreamers impaled upon their points he was desperately afraid can a man still be brave if hes afraid he heard his own voice saying small and far away and his fathers voice replied to him that is the only time a man can be brave now bran the crow urged choose fly or die death reached for him screaming bran spread his arms and flew wings unseen drank the wind and filled and pulled him upward the terrible needles of ice receded below him the sky opened up above bran soared it was better than climbing it was better than anything the world grew small beneath him im flying he cried out in delight page ive noticed said the threeeyed crow it took to the air flapping its wings in his face slowing him blinding him he faltered in the air as its pinions beat against his cheeks its beak stabbed at him fiercely and bran felt a sudden blinding pain in the middle of his forehead between his eyes what are you doing he shrieked the crow opened its beak and cawed at him a shrill scream of fear and the grey mists shuddered and swirled around him and ripped away like a veil and he saw that the crow was really a woman a serving woman with long black hair and he knew her from somewhere from winterfell yes that was it he remembered her now and then he realized that he was in winterfell in a bed high in some chilly tower room and the blackhaired woman dropped a basin of water to shatter on the floor and ran down the steps shouting hes awake hes awake hes awake bran touched his forehead between his eyes the place where the crow had pecked him was still burning but there was nothing there no blood no wound he felt weak and dizzy he tried to get out of bed but nothing happened and then there was movement beside the bed and something landed lightly on his legs he felt nothing a pair of yellow eyes looked into his own shining like the sun the window was open and it was cold in the room but the warmth that came off the wolf enfolded him like a hot bath his pup bran realized or was it he was so big now he reached out to pet him his hand trembling like a leaf when his brother robb burst into the room breathless from his dash up the tower steps the direwolf was licking brans face bran looked up calmly his name is summer he said catelyn we will make kings landing within the hour catelyn turned away from the rail and forced herself to smile your oarmen have done well by us captain each one of them shall have a silver stag as a token of my gratitude captain moreo turnitis favored her with a half bow you are far too generous lady stark the honor of carrying a great lady like yourself is all the reward they need but theyll take the silver anyway moreo smiled as you say he spoke the common tongue fluently with only the slightest hint of a tyroshi accent hed been plying the narrow sea for thirty years hed told her as oarman quartermaster and finally captain of his own trading galleys the stonn dancer was his fourth ship and his fastest a twomasted galley of sixty oars she had certainly been the fastest of the ships available in white harbor when catelyn and ser rodrik page cassel had arrived after their headlong gallop downriver the tyroshi were notorious for their avarice and ser rodrik had argued for hiring a fishing sloop out of the three sisters but catelyn had insisted on the galley it was good that she had the winds had been against them much of the voyage and without the galleys oars theyd still be beating their way past the fingers instead of skimming toward kings landing and journeys end so close she thought beneath the linen bandages her fingers still throbbed where the dagger had bitten the pain was her scourge catelyn felt lest she forget she could not bend the last two fingers on her left hand and the others would never again be dexterous yet that was a small enough price to pay for brans life ser rodrik chose that moment to appear on deck my good friend said moreo through his forked green beard the tyroshi loved bright colors even in their facial hair it is so fine to see you looking better yes ser rodrik agreed i havent wanted to die for almost two days now he bowed to catelyn my lady he was looking better a shade thinner than he had been when they set out from white harbor but almost himself again the strong winds in the bite and the roughness of the narrow sea had not agreed with him and hed almost gone over the side when the storm seized them unexpectedly off dragonstone yet somehow he had clung to a rope until three of moreos men could rescue him and carry him safely below decks the captain was just telling me that our voyage is almost at an end she said ser rodrik managed a wry smile so soon he looked odd without his great white side whiskers smaller somehow less fierce and ten years older yet back on the bite it had seemed prudent to submit to a crewmans razor after his whiskers had become hopelessly befouled for the third time while he leaned over the rail and retched into the swirling winds i will leave you to discuss your business captain moreo said he bowed and took his leave of them the galley skimmed the water like a dragonfly her oars rising and falling in perfect time ser rodrik held the rail and looked out over the passing shore i have not been the most valiant of protectors catelyn touched his arm we are here ser rodrik and safely that is all that truly matters her hand groped beneath her cloak her fingers stiff and fumbling the dagger was still at her side she found she had to touch it now and then to reassure herself now we must reach the kings masteratarms and pray that he can be trusted ser aron santagar is a vain man but an honest one ser rodriks hand went to his face to stroke his whiskers and discovered once again that they were gone he looked nonplussed he may know the blade yes but my lady the moment we go ashore we are at risk and there are those at court who will page know you on sight catelyns mouth grew tight littlefinger she murmured his face swam up before her a boys face though he was a boy no longer his father had died several years before so he was lord baelish now yet still they called him littlefinger her brother edmure had given him that name long ago at riverrun his familys modest holdings were on the smallest of the fingers and petyr had been slight and short for his age ser rodrik cleared his throat lord baelish once ah his thought trailed off uncertainly in search of the polite word catelyn was past delicacy he was my fathers ward we grew up together in riverrun i thought of him as a brother but his feelings for me were more than brotherly when it was announced that i was to wed brandon stark petyr challenged for the right to my hand it was madness brandon was twenty petyr scarcely fifteen i had to beg brandon to spare petyrs life he let him off with a scar afterward my father sent him away i have not seen him since she lifted her face to the spray as if the brisk wind could blow the memories away he wrote to me at riverrun after brandon was killed but i burned the letter unread by then i knew that ned would marry me in his brothers place ser rodriks fingers fumbled once again for nonexistent whiskers littlefinger sits on the small council now i knew he would rise high catelyn said he was always clever even as a boy but it is one thing to be clever and another to be wise i wonder what the years have done to him high overhead the fareyes sang out from the rigging captain moreo came scrambling across the deck giving orders and all around them the stonn dancer burst into frenetic activity as kings landing slid into view atop its three high hills three hundred years ago catelyn knew those heights had been covered with forest and only a handful of fisherfolk had lived on the north shore of the blackwater rush where that deep swift river flowed into the sea then aegon the conqueror had sailed from dragonstone it was here that his army had put ashore and there on the highest hill that he built his first crude redoubt of wood and earth now the city covered the shore as far as catelyn could see manses and arbors and granaries brick storehouses and timbered inns and merchants stalls taverns and graveyards and brothels all piled one on another she could hear the clamor of the fish market even at this distance between the buildings were broad roads lined with trees wandering crookback streets and alleys so narrow that two men could not walk abreast visenyas hill was crowned by the great sept of baelor with its seven crystal towers across the city on the hill of rhaenys stood the blackened walls of the dragonpit its huge dome collapsing into ruin its bronze doors closed now for a century the street of the sisters ran between them straight as an arrow the city walls rose in the distance high and strong a hundred quays lined the waterfront and the harbor was crowded with ships deepwater fishing boats and river runners came and went ferrymen poled back and forth across the blackwater rush trading galleys unloaded goods from braavos and pentos and lys catelyn spied the queens ornate barge tied page up beside a fatbellied whaler from the port of ibben its hull black with tar while upriver a dozen lean golden warships rested in their cribs sails furled and cruel iron rams lapping at the water and above it all frowning down from aegons high hill was the red keep seven huge drumtowers crowned with iron ramparts an immense grim barbican vaulted halls and covered bridges barracks and dungeons and granaries massive curtain walls studded with archers nests all fashioned of pale red stone aegon the conqueror had commanded it built his son maegor the cruel had seen it completed afterward he had taken the heads of every stonemason woodworker and builder who had labored on it only the blood of the dragon would ever know the secrets of the fortress the dragonlords had built he vowed yet now the banners that flew from its battlements were golden not black and where the threeheaded dragon had once breathed fire now pranced the crowned stag of house baratheon a highmasted swan ship from the summer isles was beating out from port its white sails huge with wind the stonn dancer moved past it pulling steadily for shore my lady ser rodrik said i have thought on how best to proceed while i lay abed you must not enter the castle i will go in your stead and bring ser aron to you in some safe place she studied the old knight as the galley drew near to a pier moreo was shouting in the vulgar valyrian of the free cities you would be as much at risk as i would ser rodrik smiled i think not i looked at my reflection in the water earlier and scarcely recognized myself my mother was the last person to see me without whiskers and she is forty years dead i believe i am safe enough my lady moreo bellowed a command as one sixty oars lifted from the river then reversed and backed water the galley slowed another shout the oars slid back inside the hull as they thumped against the dock tyroshi seamen leapt down to tie up moreo came bustling up all smiles kings landing my lady as you did command and never has a ship made a swifter or surer passage will you be needing assistance to carry your things to the castle we shall not be going to the castle perhaps you can suggest an inn someplace clean and comfortable and not too far from the river the tyroshi fingered his forked green beard just so i know of several establishments that might suit your needs yet first if i may be so bold there is the matter of the second half of the payment we agreed upon and of course the extra silver you were so kind as to promise sixty stags i believe it was for the oarmen catelyn reminded him oh of a certainty said moreo though perhaps i should hold it for them until we return to tyrosh for the sake of their wives and children if you give them the silver here my lady they will dice it away or spend it all for a nights pleasure there are worse things to spend money on ser rodrik put in winter is coming page a man must make his own choices catelyn said they earned the silver how they spend it is no concern of mine as you say my lady moreo replied bowing and smiling just to be sure catelyn paid the oarmen herself a stag to each man and a copper to the two men who carried their chests halfway up visenyas hill to the inn that moreo had suggested it was a rambling old place on eel alley the woman who owned it was a sour crone with a wandering eye who looked them over suspiciously and bit the coin that catelyn offered her to make sure it was real her rooms were large and airy though and moreo swore that her fish stew was the most savory in all the seven kingdoms best of all she had no interest in their names i think it best if you stay away from the common room ser rodrik said after they had settled in even in a place like this one never knows who may be watching he wore ringmail dagger and longsword under a dark cloak with a hood he could pull up over his head i will be back before nightfall with ser aron he promised rest now my lady catelyn was tired the voyage had been long and fatiguing and she was no longer as young as she had been her windows opened on the alley and rooftops with a view of the blackwater beyond she watched ser rodrik set off striding briskly through the busy streets until he was lost in the crowds then decided to take his advice the bedding was stuffed with straw instead of feathers but she had no trouble falling asleep she woke to a pounding on her door catelyn sat up sharply outside the window the rooftops of kings landing were red in the light of the setting sun she had slept longer than she intended a fist hammered at her door again and a voice called out open in the name of the king a moment she called out she wrapped herself in her cloak the dagger was on the bedside table she snatched it up before she unlatched the heavy wooden door the men who pushed into the room wore the black ringmail and golden cloaks of the city watch their leader smiled at the dagger in her hand and said no need for that mady were to escort you to the castle by whose authority she said he showed her a ribbon catelyn felt her breath catch in her throat the seal was a mockingbird in grey wax petyr she said so soon something must have happened to ser rodrik she looked at the head guardsman do you know who i am no mlady he said mlord littlefinger said only to bring you to him and see that you were not mistreated catelyn nodded you may wait outside while i dress she bathed her hands in the basin and wrapped them in clean linen her fingers were thick and awkward page as she struggled to lace up her bodice and knot a drab brown cloak about her neck how could littlefinger have known she was here ser rodrik would never have told him old he might be but he was stubborn and loyal to a fault were they too late had the lannisters reached kings landing before her no if that were true ned would be here too and surely he would have come to her how then she thought moreo the tyroshi knew who they were and where they were damn him she hoped hed gotten a good price for the information they had brought a horse for her the lamps were being lit along the streets as they set out and catelyn felt the eyes of the city on her as she rode surrounded by the guard in their golden cloaks when they reached the red keep the portcullis was down and the great gates sealed for the night but the castle windows were alive with flickering lights the guardsmen left their mounts outside the walls and escorted her through a narrow postern door then up endless steps to a tower he was alone in the room seated at a heavy wooden table an oil lamp beside him as he wrote when they ushered her inside he set down his pen and looked at her cat he said quietly why have i been brought here in this fashion he rose and gestured brusquely to the guards leave us the men departed you were not mistreated i trust he said after they had gone i gave firm instructions he noticed her bandages your hands catelyn ignored the implied question i am not accustomed to being summoned like a serving wench she said icily as a boy you still knew the meaning of courtesy ive angered you my lady that was never my intent he looked contrite the look brought back vivid memories for catelyn he had been a sly child but after his mischiefs he always looked contrite it was a gift he had the years had not changed him much petyr had been a small boy and he had grown into a small man an inch or two shorter than catelyn slender and quick with the sharp features she remembered and the same laughing greygreen eyes he had a little pointed chin beard now and threads of silver in his dark hair though he was still shy of thirty they went well with the silver mockingbird that fastened his cloak even as a child he had always loved his silver how did you know i was in the city she asked him lord varys knows all petyr said with a sly smile he will be joining us shortly but i wanted to see you alone first it has been too long cat how many years catelyn ignored his familiarity there were more important questions so it was the kings spider who found me littlefinger winced you dont want to call him that hes very sensitive comes of being an eunuch i imagine nothing happens in this city without varys knowing oftimes he knows about it before it happens he has informants everywhere his little birds he calls them one of his little birds heard about your visit thankfully varys came to me first page why you he shrugged why not me i am master of coin the kings own councillor selmy and lord renly rode north to meet robert and lord stannis is gone to dragonstone leaving only maester pycelle and me i was the obvious choice i was ever a friend to your sister lysa varys knows that does varys know about lord varys knows everything except why you are here he lifted an eyebrow why are you here a wife is allowed to yearn for her husband and if a mother needs her daughters close who can tell her no littlefinger laughed oh very good my lady but please dont expect me to believe that i know you too well what were the tully words again her throat was dry family duty honor she recited stiffly he did know her too well family duty honor he echoed all of which required you to remain in winterfell where our hand left you no my lady something has happened this sudden trip of yours bespeaks a certain urgency i beg of you let me help old sweet friends should never hesitate to rely upon each other there was a soft knock on the door enter littlefinger called out the man who stepped through the door was plump perfumed powdered and as hairless as an egg he wore a vest of woven gold thread over a loose gown of purple silk and on his feet were pointed slippers of soft velvet lady stark he said taking her hand in both of his to see you again after so many years is such a joy his flesh was soft and moist and his breath smelled of lilacs oh your poor hands have you burned yourself sweet lady the fingers are so delicate our good maester pycelle makes a marvelous salve shall i send for a jar catelyn slid her fingers from his grasp i thank you my lord but my own maester luwin has already seen to my hurts varys bobbed his head i was grievous sad to hear about your son and him so young the gods are cruel on that we agree lord varys she said the title was but a courtesy due him as a council member varys was lord of nothing but the spiderweb the master of none but his whisperers the eunuch spread his soft hands on more than that i hope sweet lady i have great esteem for your husband our new hand and i know we do both love king robert yes she was forced to say for a certainty never has a king been so beloved as our robert quipped littlefinger he smiled slyly at least in lord varyss hearing good lady varys said with great solicitude there are men in the free cities with wondrous healing page powers say only the word and i will send for one for your dear bran maester luwin is doing all that can be done for bran she told him she would not speak of bran not here not with these men she trusted littlefinger only a little and varys not at all she would not let them see her grief lord baelish tells me that i have you to thank for bringing me here varys giggled like a little girl oh yes i suppose i am guilty i hope you forgive me kind lady he eased himself down into a seat and put his hands together i wonder if we might trouble you to show us the dagger catelyn stark stared at the eunuch in stunned disbelief he was a spider she thought wildly an enchanter or worse he knew things no one could possibly know unless what have you done to ser rodrik she demanded littlefinger was lost i feel rather like the knight who arrives at the battle without his lance what dagger are we talking about who is ser rodrik ser rodrik cassel is masteratarms at winterfell varys informed him i assure you lady stark nothing at all has been done to the good knight he did call here early this afternoon he visited with ser aron santagar in the armory and they talked of a certain dagger about sunset they left the castle together and walked to that dreadful hovel where you were staying they are still there drinking in the common room waiting for your return ser rodrik was very distressed to find you gone how could you know all that the whisperings of little birds varys said smiling i know things sweet lady that is the nature of my service he shrugged you do have the dagger with you yes catelyn pulled it out from beneath her cloak and threw it down on the table in front of him here perhaps your little birds will whisper the name of the man it belongs to varys lifted the knife with exaggerated delicacy and ran a thumb along its edge blood welled and he let out a squeal and dropped the dagger back on the table careful catelyn told him its sharp nothing holds an edge like valyrian steel littlefinger said as varys sucked at his bleeding thumb and looked at catelyn with sullen admonition littlefinger hefted the knife lightly in his hand testing the grip he flipped it in the air caught it again with his other hand such sweet balance you want to find the owner is that the reason for this visit you have no need of ser aron for that my lady you should have come to me and if i had she said what would you have told me i would have told you that there was only one knife like this at kings landing he grasped the blade between thumb and forefinger page drew it back over his shoulder and threw it across the room with a practiced flick of his wrist it struck the door and buried itself deep in the oak quivering its mine yours it made no sense petyr had not been at winterfell until the tourney on prince joffreys name day he said crossing the room to wrench the dagger from the wood i backed ser jaime in the jousting along with half the court petyrs sheepish grin made him look half a boy again when loras tyrell unhorsed him many of us became a trifle poorer ser jaime lost a hundred golden dragons the queen lost an emerald pendant and i lost my knife her grace got the emerald back but the winner kept the rest who catelyn demanded her mouth dry with fear her fingers ached with remembered pain the imp said littlefinger as lord varys watched her face tyrion lannister jon the courtyard rang to the song of swords under black wool boiled leather and mail sweat trickled icily down jons chest as he pressed the attack grenn stumbled backward defending himself clumsily when he raised his sword jon went underneath it with a sweeping blow that crunched against the back of the other boys leg and sent him staggering grenns downcut was answered by an overhand that dented his helm when he tried a sideswing jon swept aside his blade and slammed a mailed forearm into his chest grenn lost his footing and sat down hard in the snow jon knocked his sword from his fingers with a slash to his wrist that brought a cry of pain enough ser alliser thorne had a voice with an edge like valyrian steel grenn cradled his hand the bastard broke my wrist the bastard hamstrung you opened your empty skull and cut off your hand or would have if these blades had an edge its fortunate for you that the watch needs stableboys as well as rangers ser alliser gestured at jeren and toad get the aurochs on his feet he has funeral arrangements to make jon took off his helm as the other boys were pulling grenn to his feet the frosty morning air felt good on his face he leaned on his sword drew a deep breath and allowed himself a moment to savor the victory that is a longsword not an old mans cane ser alliser said sharply are your legs hurting lord snow jon hated that name a mockery that ser alliser had hung on him the first day he came to practice the boys had picked it up and now he heard it everywhere he slid the longsword back into its scabbard no he replied page thorne strode toward him crisp black leathers whispering faintly as he moved he was a compact man of fifty years spare and hard with grey in his black hair and eyes like chips of onyx the truth now he commanded im tired jon admitted his arm burned from the weight of the longsword and he was starting to feel his bruises now that the fight was done what you are is weak i won no the aurochs lost one of the other boys sniggered jon knew better than to reply he had beaten everyone that ser alliser had sent against him yet it gained him nothing the masteratarms served up only derision thorne hated him jon had decided of course he hated the other boys even worse that will be all thorne told them i can only stomach so much ineptitude in any one day if the others ever come for us i pray they have archers because you lot are fit for nothing more than arrow fodder jon followed the rest back to the armory walking alone he often walked alone here there were almost twenty in the group he trained with yet not one he could call a friend most were two or three years his senior yet not one was half the fighter robb had been at fourteen dareon was quick but afraid of being hit pyp used his sword like a dagger jeren was weak as a girl grenn slow and clumsy halders blows were brutally hard but he ran right into your attacks the more time he spent with them the more jon despised them inside jon hung sword and scabbard from a hook in the stone wall ignoring the others around him methodically he began to strip off his mail leather and sweatsoaked woolens chunks of coal burned in iron braziers at either end of the long room but jon found himself shivering the chill was always with him here in a few years he would forget what it felt like to be warm the weariness came on him suddenly as he donned the roughspun blacks that were their everyday wear he sat on a bench his fingers fumbling with the fastenings on his cloak so cold he thought remembering the warm halls of winterfell where the hot waters ran through the walls like blood through a mans body there was scant warmth to be found in castle black the walls were cold here and the people colder no one had told him the nights watch would be like this no one except tyrion lannister the dwarf had given him the truth on the road north but by then it had been too late jon wondered if his father had known what the wall would be like he must have he thought that only made it hurt the worse even his uncle had abandoned him in this cold place at the end of the world up here the genial benjen stark he had known became a different person he was first ranger and he spent his days and nights with lord commander mormont and maester aemon and the other high officers while jon was given over to the less than tender charge of ser alliser thorne page three days after their arrival jon had heard that benjen stark was to lead a halfdozen men on a ranging into the haunted forest that night he sought out his uncle in the great timbered common hall and pleaded to go with him benjen refused him curtly this is not winterfell he told him as he cut his meat with fork and dagger on the wall a man gets only what he earns youre no ranger jon only a green boy with the smell of summer still on you stupidly jon argued ill be fifteen on my name day he said almost a man grown benjen stark frowned a boy you are and a boy youll remain until ser alliser says you are fit to be a man of the nights watch if you thought your stark blood would win you easy favors you were wrong we put aside our old families when we swear our vows your father will always have a place in my heart but these are my brothers now he gestured with his dagger at the men around them all the hard cold men in black jon rose at dawn the next day to watch his uncle leave one of his rangers a big ugly man sang a bawdy song as he saddled his garron his breath steaming in the cold morning air ben stark smiled at that but he had no smile for his nephew how often must i tell you no jon well speak when i return as he watched his uncle lead his horse into the tunnel jon had remembered the things that tyrion lannister told him on the kingsroad and in his minds eye he saw ben stark lying dead his blood red on the snow the thought made him sick what was he becoming afterward he sought out ghost in the loneliness of his cell and buried his face in his thick white fur if he must be alone he would make solitude his armor castle black had no godswood only a small sept and a drunken septon but jon could not find it in him to pray to any gods old or new if they were real he thought they were as cruel and implacable as winter he missed his true brothers little rickon bright eyes shining as he begged for a sweet robb his rival and best friend and constant companion bran stubborn and curious always wanting to follow and join in whatever jon and robb were doing he missed the girls too even sansa who never called him anything but my half brother since she was old enough to understand what bastard meant and arya he missed her even more than robb skinny little thing that she was all scraped knees and tangled hair and torn clothes so fierce and willful arya never seemed to fit no more than he had yet she could always make jon smile he would give anything to be with her now to muss up her hair once more and watch her make a face to hear her finish a sentence with him you broke my wrist bastard boy jon lifted his eyes at the sullen voice grenn loomed over him thick of neck and red of face with three of his friends behind him he knew todder a short ugly boy with an unpleasant voice the recruits all called him toad the other two were the ones yoren had brought north with them jon remembered rapers taken down in the fingers hed forgotten their names he hardly ever spoke to them if he could help it they were brutes and bullies without a thimble of honor between them jon stood up ill break the other one for you if you ask nicely grenn was sixteen and a head taller than jon all four of them were bigger than he was but they did not scare him hed beaten every one of them in the yard page maybe well break you one of the rapers said try jon reached back for his sword but one of them grabbed his arm and twisted it behind his back you make us look bad complained toad you looked bad before i ever met you jon told him the boy who had his arm jerked upward on him hard pain lanced through him but jon would not cry out toad stepped close the little lordling has a mouth on him he said he had pig eyes small and shiny is that your mommys mouth bastard what was she some whore tell us her name maybe i had her a time or two he laughed jon twisted like an eel and slammed a heel down across the instep of the boy holding him there was a sudden cry of pain and he was free he flew at toad knocked him backward over a bench and landed on his chest with both hands on his throat slamming his head against the packed earth the two from the fingers pulled him off throwing him roughly to the ground grenn began to kick at him jon was rolling away from the blows when a booming voice cut through the gloom of the armory stop this now jon pulled himself to his feet donal noye stood glowering at them the yard is for fighting the armorer said keep your quarrels out of my armory or ill make them my quarrels you wont like that toad sat on the floor gingerly feeling the back of his head his fingers came away bloody he tried to kill me s true i saw it one of the rapers put in he broke my wrist grenn said again holding it out to noye for inspection the armorer gave the offered wrist the briefest of glances a bruise perhaps a sprain maestor aemon will give you a salve go with him todder that head wants looking after the rest of you return to your cells not you snow you stay jon sat heavily on the long wooden bench as the others left oblivious to the looks they gave him the silent promises of future retribution his arm was throbbing the watch has need of every man it can get donal noye said when they were alone even men like toad you wont win any honors killing him jons anger flared he said my mother was a whore i heard him what of it lord eddard stark was not a man to sleep with whores jon said icily his honor page did not prevent him from fathering a bastard did it jon was cold with rage can i go you go when i tell you to go jon stared sullenly at the smoke rising from the brazier until noye took him under the chin thick fingers twisting his head around look at me when im talking to you boy jon looked the armorer had a chest like a keg of ale and a gut to match his nose was flat and broad and he always seemed in need of a shave the left sleeve of his black wool tunic was fastened at the shoulder with a silver pin in the shape of a longsword words wont make your mother a whore she was what she was and nothing toad says can change that you know we have men on the wall whose mothers were whores not my mother jon thought stubbornly he knew nothing of his mother eddard stark would not talk of her yet he dreamed of her at times so often that he could almost see her face in his dreams she was beautiful and highborn and her eyes were kind you think you had it hard being a high lords bastard the armorer went on that boy jeren is a septons get and cotter pyke is the baseborn son of a tavern wench now he commands eastwatch by the sea i dont care jon said i dont care about them and i dont care about you or thorne or benjen stark or any of it i hate it here its too its cold yes cold and hard and mean thats the wall and the men who walk it not like the stories your wet nurse told you well piss on the stories and piss on your wet nurse this is the way it is and youre here for life same as the rest of us life jon repeated bitterly the armorer could talk about life hed had one hed only taken the black after hed lost an arm at the siege of storms end before that hed smithed for stannis baratheon the kings brother hed seen the seven kingdoms from one end to the other hed feasted and wenched and fought in a hundred battles they said it was donal noye whod forged king roberts warhammer the one that crushed the life from rhaegar targaryen on the trident hed done all the things that jon would never do and then when he was old well past thirty hed taken a glancing blow from an axe and the wound had festered until the whole arm had to come off only then crippled had donal noye come to the wall when his life was all but over yes life noye said a long life or a short one its up to you snow the road youre walking one of your brothers will slit your throat for you one night theyre not my brothers jon snapped they hate me because im better than they are no they hate you because you act like youre better than they are they look at you and see a castlebred bastard who thinks hes a lordling the armorer leaned close youre no lordling remember that youre a snow not a stark youre a bastard and a bully page a bully jon almost choked on the word the accusation was so unjust it took his breath away they were the ones who came after me four of them four that youve humiliated in the yard four who are probably afraid of you ive watched you fight its not training with you put a good edge on your sword and theyd be dead meat you know it i know it they know it you leave them nothing you shame them does that make you proud jon hesitated he did feel proud when he won why shouldnt he but the armorer was taking that away too making it sound as if he were doing something wrong theyre all older than me he said defensively older and bigger and stronger thats the truth ill wager your masteratarms taught you how to fight bigger men at winterfell though who was he some old knight ser rodrik cassel jon said warily there was a trap here he felt it closing around him donal noye leaned forward into jons face now think on this boy none of these others have ever had a masteratarms until ser alliser their fathers were farmers and wagonmen and poachers smiths and miners and oars on a trading galley what they know of fighting they learned between decks in the alleys of oldtown and lannisport in wayside brothels and taverns on the kingsroad they may have clacked a few sticks together before they came here but i promise you not one in twenty was ever rich enough to own a real sword his look was grim so how do you like the taste of your victories now lord snow dont call me that jon said sharply but the force had gone out of his anger suddenly he felt ashamed and guilty i never i didnt think best you start thinking noye warned him that or sleep with a dagger by your bed now go by the time jon left the armory it was almost midday the sun had broken through the clouds he turned his back on it and lifted his eyes to the wall blazing blue and crystalline in the sunlight even after all these weeks the sight of it still gave him the shivers centuries of windblown dirt had pocked and scoured it covering it like a film and it often seemed a pale grey the color of an overcast sky but when the sun caught it fair on a bright day it shone alive with light a colossal bluewhite cliff that filled up half the sky the largest structure ever built by the hands of man benjen stark had told jon on the kingsroad when they had first caught sight of the wall in the distance and beyond a doubt the most useless tyrion lannister had added with a grin but even the imp grew silent as they rode closer you could see it from miles off a pale blue line across the northern horizon stretching away to the east and west and vanishing in the far distance immense and unbroken this is the end of the world it seemed to say when they finally spied castle black its timbered keeps and stone towers looked like nothing more than page a handful of toy blocks scattered on the snow beneath the vast wall of ice the ancient stronghold of the black brothers was no winterfell no true castle at all lacking walls it could not be defended not from the south or east or west but it was only the north that concerned the nights watch and to the north loomed the wall almost seven hundred feet high it stood three times the height of the tallest tower in the stronghold it sheltered his uncle said the top was wide enough for a dozen armored knights to ride abreast the gaunt outlines of huge catapults and monstrous wooden cranes stood sentry up there like the skeletons of great birds and among them walked men in black as small as ants as he stood outside the armory looking up jon felt almost as overwhelmed as he had that day on the kingsroad when hed seen it for the first time the wall was like that sometimes he could almost forget that it was there the way you forgot about the sky or the earth underfoot but there were other times when it seemed as if there was nothing else in the world it was older than the seven kingdoms and when he stood beneath it and looked up it made jon dizzy he could feel the great weight of all that ice pressing down on him as if it were about to topple and somehow jon knew that if it fell the world fell with it makes you wonder what lies beyond a familiar voice said jon looked around lannister i didnt seei mean i thought i was alone tyrion lannister was bundled in furs so thickly he looked like a very small bear theres much to be said for taking people unawares you never know what you might learn you wont learn anything from me jon told him he had seen little of the dwarf since their journey ended as the queens own brother tyrion lannister had been an honored guest of the nights watch the lord commander had given him rooms in the kings towersocalled though no king had visited it for a hundred yearsand lannister dined at mormonts own table and spent his days riding the wall and his nights dicing and drinking with ser alliser and bowen marsh and the other high officers oh i learn things everywhere i go the little man gestured up at the wall with a gnarled black walking stick as i was saying why is it that when one man builds a wall the next man immediately needs to know whats on the other side he cocked his head and looked at jon with his curious mismatched eyes you do want to know whats on the other side dont you its nothing special jon said he wanted to ride with benjen stark on his rangings deep into the mysteries of the haunted forest wanted to fight mance rayders wildlings and ward the realm against the others but it was better not to speak of the things you wanted the rangers say its just woods and mountains and frozen lakes with lots of snow and ice and the grumkins and the snarks tyrion said let us not forget them lord snow or else whats that big thing for dont call me lord snow the dwarf lifted an eyebrow would you rather be called the imp let them see that their words can cut you and youll never be free of the mockery if they want to give you a name take it make it your own then they cant hurt you with it anymore he gestured with his stick come walk with me theyll be serving some vile stew in the common hall by now and i could do with a bowl of something hot page jon was hungry too so he fell in beside lannister and slowed his pace to match the dwarfs awkward waddling steps the wind was rising and they could hear the old wooden buildings creaking around them and in the distance a heavy shutter banging over and over forgotten once there was a muffled thump as a blanket of snow slid from a roof and landed near them i dont see your wolf lannister said as they walked i chain him up in the old stables when were training they board all the horses in the east stables now so no one bothers him the rest of the time he stays with me my sleeping cell is in hardins tower thats the one with the broken battlement no shattered stone in the yard below and a lean to it like our noble king robert after a long nights drinking i thought all those buildings had been abandoned jon shrugged no one cares where you sleep most of the old keeps are empty you can pick any cell you want once castle black had housed five thousand fighting men with all their horses and servants and weapons now it was home to a tenth that number and parts of it were falling into ruin tyrion lannisters laughter steamed in the cold air ill be sure to tell your father to arrest more stonemasons before your tower collapses jon could taste the mockery there but there was no denying the truth the watch had built nineteen great strongholds along the wall but only three were still occupied eastwatch on its grey windswept shore the shadow tower hard by the mountains where the wall ended and castle black between them at the end of the kingsroad the other keeps long deserted were lonely haunted places where cold winds whistled through black windows and the spirits of the dead manned the parapets its better that im by myself jon said stubbornly the rest of them are scared of ghost wise boys lannister said then he changed the subject the talk is your uncle is too long away jon remembered the wish hed wished in his anger the vision of benjen stark dead in the snow and he looked away quickly the dwarf had a way of sensing things and jon did not want him to see the guilt in his eyes he said hed be back by my name day he admitted his name day had come and gone unremarked a fortnight past they were looking for ser waymar royce his father is bannerman to lord arryn uncle benjen said they might search as far as the shadow tower thats all the way up in the mountains i hear that a good many rangers have vanished of late lannister said as they mounted the steps to the common hall he grinned and pulled open the door perhaps the grumkins are hungry this year inside the hall was immense and drafty even with a fire roaring in its great hearth crows nested in the timbers of its lofty ceiling jon heard their cries overhead as he accepted a bowl of stew and a heel of black bread from the days cooks grenn and toad and some of the others were seated at the bench nearest the warmth laughing and cursing each other in rough voices jon eyed them thoughtfully for a moment then he chose a spot at the far end of the hall well away from the other diners page tyrion lannister sat across from him sniffing at the stew suspiciously barley onion carrot he muttered someone should tell the cooks that turnip isnt a meat its mutton stew jon pulled off his gloves and warmed his hands in the steam rising from the bowl the smell made his mouth water snow jon knew alliser thornes voice but there was a curious note in it that he had not heard before he turned the lord commander wants to see you now for a moment jon was too frightened to move why would the lord commander want to see him they had heard something about benjen he thought wildly he was dead the vision had come true is it my uncle he blurted is he returned safe the lord commander is not accustomed to waiting was ser allisers reply and i am not accustomed to having my commands questioned by bastards tyrion lannister swung off the bench and rose stop it thorne youre frightening the boy keep out of matters that dont concern you lannister you have no place here i have a place at court though the dwarf said smiling a word in the right ear and youll die a sour old man before you get another boy to train now tell snow why the old bear needs to see him is there news of his uncle no ser alliser said this is another matter entirely a bird arrived this morning from winterfell with a message that concerns his brother he corrected himself his half brother bran jon breathed scrambling to his feet somethings happened to bran tyrion lannister laid a hand on his arm jon he said i am truly sorry jon scarcely heard him he brushed off tyrions hand and strode across the hall he was running by the time he hit the doors he raced to the commanders keep dashing through drifts of old snow when the guards passed him he took the tower steps two at a time by the time he burst into the presence of the lord commander his boots were soaked and jon was wildeyed and panting bran he said what does it say about bran jeor mormont lord commander of the nights watch was a gruff old man with an immense bald head and a shaggy grey beard he had a raven on his arm and he was feeding it kernels of corn i am told you can read he shook the raven off and it flapped its wings and flew to the window where it sat watching as mormont drew a roll of paper from his belt and handed it to jon com it muttered in a raucous voice com com jons finger traced the outline of the direwolf in the white wax of the broken seat he recognized robbs page hand but the letters seemed to blur and run as he tried to read them he realized he was crying and then through the tears he found the sense in the words and raised his head he woke up he said the gods gave him back crippled mormont said im sorry boy read the rest of the letter he looked at the words but they didnt matter nothing mattered bran was going to live my brother is going to live he told mormont the lord commander shook his head gathered up a fistful of corn and whistled the raven flew to his shoulder crying live live jon ran down the stairs a smile on his face and robbs letter in his hand my brother is going to live he told the guards they exchanged a look he ran back to the common hall where he found tyrion lannister just finishing his meal he grabbed the little man under the arms hoisted him up in the air and spun him around in a circle bran is going to live he whooped lannister looked startled jon put him down and thrust the paper into his hands here read it he said others were gathering around and looking at him curiously jon noticed grenn a few feet away a thick woolen bandage was wrapped around one hand he looked anxious and uncomfortable not menacing at all jon went to him grenn edged backward and put up his hands stay away from me now you bastard jon smiled at him im sorry about your wrist robb used the same move on me once only with a wooden blade it hurt like seven hells but yours must be worse look if you want i can show you how to defend that alliser thorne overheard him lord snow wants to take my place now he sneered id have an easier time teaching a wolf to juggle than you will training this aurochs ill take that wager ser alliser jon said id love to see ghost juggle jon heard grenn suck in his breath shocked silence fell then tyrion lannister guffawed three of the black brothers joined in from a nearby table the laughter spread up and down the benches until even the cooks joined in the birds stirred in the rafters and finally even grenn began to chuckle ser alliser never took his eyes from jon as the laughter rolled around him his face darkened and his sword hand curled into a fist that was a grievous error lord snow he said at last in the acid tones of an enemy eddard eddard stark rode through the towering bronze doors of the red keep sore tired hungry and irritable he was still a horse dreaming of a long hot soak a roast fowl and a featherbed when the kings steward told him that grand maester pycelle had convened an urgent meeting of the small council the honor of the hands presence was requested as soon as it was convenient it will be convenient on the morrow ned snapped as he dismounted page the steward bowed very low i shall give the councillors your regrets my lord no damn it ned said it would not do to offend the council before he had even begun i will see them pray give me a few moments to change into something more presentable yes my lord the steward said we have given you lord arryns former chambers in the tower of the hand if it please you i shall have your things taken there my thanks ned said as he ripped off his riding gloves and tucked them into his belt the rest of his household was coming through the gate behind him ned saw vayon poole his own steward and called out it seems the council has urgent need of me see that my daughters find their bedchambers and tell jory to keep them there arya is not to go exploring poole bowed ned turned back to the royal steward my wagons are still straggling through the city i shall need appropriate garments it will be my great pleasure the steward said and so ned had come striding into the council chambers bonetired and dressed in borrowed clothing to find four members of the small council waiting for him the chamber was richly furnished myrish carpets covered the floor instead of rushes and in one corner a hundred fabulous beasts cavorted in bright paints on a carved screen from the summer isles the walls were hung with tapestries from norvos and qohor and lys and a pair of valyrian sphinxes flanked the door eyes of polished garnet smoldering in black marble faces the councillor ned liked least the eunuch varys accosted him the moment he entered lord stark i was grievous sad to hear about your troubles on the kingsroad we have all been visiting the sept to light candles for prince joffrey i pray for his recovery his hand left powder stains on neds sleeve and he smelled as foul and sweet as flowers on a grave your gods have heard you ned replied cool yet polite the prince grows stronger every day he disentangled himself from the eunuchs grip and crossed the room to where lord renly stood by the screen talking quietly with a short man who could only be littlefinger renly had been a boy of eight when robert won the throne but he had grown into a man so like his brother that ned found it disconcerting whenever he saw him it was as if the years had slipped away and robert stood before him fresh from his victory on the trident i see you have arrived safely lord stark renly said and you as well ned replied you must forgive me but sometimes you look the very image of your brother robert a poor copy renly said with a shrug though much better dressed littlefinger quipped lord renly spends more on clothing than half the ladies of the court it was true enough lord renly was in dark green velvet with a dozen golden stags embroidered on his page doublet a clothofgold half cape was draped casually across one shoulder fastened with an emerald brooch there are worse crimes renly said with a laugh the wayyou dress for one littlefinger ignored the jibe he eyed ned with a smile on his lips that bordered on insolence i have hoped to meet you for some years lord stark no doubt lady catelyn has mentioned me to you she has ned replied with a chill in his voice the sly arrogance of the comment rankled him i understand you knew my brother brandon as well renly baratheon laughed varys shuffled over to listen rather too well littlefinger said i still carry a token of his esteem did brandon speak of me too often and with some heat ned said hoping that would end it he had no patience with this game they played this dueling with words i should have thought that heat ill suits you starks littlefinger said here in the south they say you are all made of ice and melt when you ride below the neck i do not plan on melting soon lord baelish you may count on it ned moved to the council table and said maester pycelle i trust you are well the grand maester smiled gently from his tall chair at the foot of the table well enough for a man of my years my lord he replied yet i do tire easily i fear wispy strands of white hair fringed the broad bald dome of his forehead above a kindly face his maesters collar was no simple metal choker such as luwin wore but two dozen heavy chains wound together into a ponderous metal necklace that covered him from throat to breast the links were forged of every metal known to man black iron and red gold bright copper and dull lead steel and tin and pale silver brass and bronze and platinum garnets and amethysts and black pearls adorned the metalwork and here and there an emerald or ruby perhaps we might begin soon the grand maester said hands knitting together atop his broad stomach i fear i shall fall asleep if we wait much longer as you will the kings seat sat empty at the head of the table the crowned stag of baratheon embroidered in gold thread on its pillows ned took the chair beside it as the right hand of his king my lords he said formally i am sorry to have kept you waiting you are the kings hand varys said we serve at your pleasure lord stark as the others took their accustomed seats it struck eddard stark forcefully that he did not belong here in this room with these men he remembered what robert had told him in the crypts below winterfell i am surrounded by flatterers andfools the king had insisted ned looked down the council table and wondered which were the flatterers and which the fools he thought he knew already we are but five he pointed out lord stannis took himself to dragonstone not long after the king went north varys said and our gallant ser barristan no doubt rides page beside the king as he makes his way through the city as befits the lord commander of the kingsguard perhaps we had best wait for ser barristan and the king to join us ned suggested renly baratheon laughed aloud if we wait for my brother to grace us with his royal presence it could be a long sit our good king robert has many cares varys said he entrusts some small matters to us to lighten his load what lord varys means is that all this business of coin and crops and justice bores my royal brother to tears lord renly said so it falls to us to govern the realm he does send us a command from time to time he drew a tightly rolled paper from his sleeve and laid it on the table this morning he commanded me to ride ahead with all haste and ask grand maester pycelle to convene this council at once he has an urgent task for us littlefinger smiled and handed the paper to ned it bore the royal seal ned broke the wax with his thumb and flattened the letter to consider the kings urgent command reading the words with mounting disbelief was there no end to roberts folly and to do this in his name that was salt in the wound gods be good he swore what lord eddard means to say lord renly announced is that his grace instructs us to stage a great tournament in honor of his appointment as the hand of the king how much asked littlefinger mildly ned read the answer off the letter forty thousand golden dragons to the champion twenty thousand to the man who comes second another twenty to the winner of the melee and ten thousand to the victor of the archery competition ninety thousand gold pieces littlefinger sighed and we must not neglect the other costs robert will want a prodigious feast that means cooks carpenters serving girls singers jugglers fools fools we have in plenty lord renly said grand maester pycelle looked to littlefinger and asked will the treasury bear the expense what treasury is that littlefinger replied with a twist of his mouth spare me the foolishness maester you know as well as i that the treasury has been empty for years i shall have to borrow the money no doubt the lannisters will be accommodating we owe lord tywin some three million dragons at present what matter another hundred thousand ned was stunned are you claiming that the crown is three million gold pieces in debt the crown is more than six million gold pieces in debt lord stark the lannisters are the biggest part of it but we have also borrowed from lord tyrell the iron bank of braavos and several tyroshi trading cartels of late ive had to turn to the faith the high septon haggles worse than a dornish fishmonger page ned was aghast aerys targaryen left a treasury flowing with gold how could you let this happen littlefinger gave a shrug the master of coin finds the money the king and the hand spend it i will not believe that jon arryn allowed robert to beggar the realm ned said hotly grand maester pycelle shook his great bald head his chains clinking softly lord arryn was a prudent man but i fear that his grace does not always listen to wise counsel my royal brother loves tournaments and feasts renly baratheon said and he loathes what he calls counting coppers i will speak with his grace ned said this tourney is an extravagance the realm cannot afford speak to him as you will lord renly said we had still best make our plans another day ned said perhaps too sharply from the looks they gave him he would have to remember that he was no longer in winterfell where only the king stood higher here he was but first among equals forgive me my lords he said in a softer tone i am tired let us call a halt for today and resume when we are fresher he did not ask for their consent but stood abruptly nodded at them all and made for the door outside wagons and riders were still pouring through the castle gates and the yard was a chaos of mud and horseflesh and shouting men the king had not yet arrived he was told since the ugliness on the trident the starks and their household had ridden well ahead of the main column the better to separate themselves from the lannisters and the growing tension robert had hardly been seen the talk was he was traveling in the huge wheelhouse drunk as often as not if so he might be hours behind but he would still be here too soon for neds liking he had only to look at sansas face to feel the rage twisting inside him once again the last fortnight of their journey had been a misery sansa blamed arya and told her that it should have been nymeria who died and arya was lost after she heard what had happened to her butchers boy sansa cried herself to sleep arya brooded silently all day long and eddard stark dreamed of a frozen hell reserved for the starks of winterfell he crossed the outer yard passed under a portcullis into the inner bailey and was walking toward what he thought was the tower of the hand when littlefinger appeared in front of him youre going the wrong way stark come with me hesitantly ned followed littlefinger led him into a tower down a stair across a small sunken courtyard and along a deserted corridor where empty suits of armor stood sentinel along the walls they were relics of the targaryens black steel with dragon scales cresting their helms now dusty and forgotten this is not the way to my chambers ned said did i say it was im leading you to the dungeons to slit your throat and seal your corpse up behind a wall littlefinger replied his voice dripping with sarcasm we have no time for this stark your wife awaits what game are you playing littlefinger catelyn is at winterfell hundreds of leagues from here oh littlefingers greygreen eyes glittered with amusement then it appears someone has managed page an astonishing impersonation for the last time come or dont come and ill keep her for myself he hurried down the steps ned followed him warily wondering if this day would ever end he had no taste for these intrigues but he was beginning to realize that they were meat and mead to a man like littlefinger at the foot of the steps was a heavy door of oak and iron petyr baelish lifted the crossbar and gestured ned through they stepped out into the ruddy glow of dusk on a rocky bluff high above the river were outside the castle ned said you are a hard man to fool stark littlefinger said with a smirk was it the sun that gave it away or the sky follow me there are niches cut in the rock try not to fall to your death catelyn would never understand with that he was over the side of the cliff descending as quick as a monkey ned studied the rocky face of the bluff for a moment then followed more slowly the niches were there as littlefinger had promised shallow cuts that would be invisible from below unless you knew just where to look for them the river was a long dizzying distance below ned kept his face pressed to the rock and tried not to look down any more often than he had to when at last he reached the bottom a narrow muddy trail along the waters edge littlefinger was lazing against a rock and eating an apple he was almost down to the core you are growing old and slow stark he said flipping the apple casually into the rushing water a game of thronls no matter we ride the rest of the way he had two horses waiting ned mounted up and trotted behind him down the trail and into the city finally baelish drew rein in front of a ramshackle building three stories timbered its windows bright with lamplight in the gathering dusk the sounds of music and raucous laughter drifted out and floated over the water beside the door swung an ornate oil lamp on a heavy chain with a globe of leaded red glass ned stark dismounted in a fury a brothel he said as he seized littlefinger by the shoulder and spun him around youve brought me all this way to take me to a brothel your wife is inside littlefinger said it was the final insult brandon was too kind to you ned said as he slammed the small man back against a wall and shoved his dagger up under the little pointed chin beard my lord no an urgent voice called out he speaks the truth there were footsteps behind him ned spun knife in hand as an old whitehaired man hurried toward them he was dressed in brown roughspun and the soft flesh under his chin wobbled as he ran this is no business of yours ned began then suddenly the recognition came he lowered the dagger astonished ser rodfik rodrik cassel nodded your lady awaits you upstairs ned was lost catelyn is truly here this is not some strange jape of littlefingers he sheathed his blade page would that it were stark littlefinger said follow me and try to look a shade more lecherous and a shade less like the kings hand it would not do to have you recognized perhaps you could fondle a breast or two just in passing they went inside through a crowded common room where a fat woman was singing bawdy songs while pretty young girls in linen shifts and wisps of colored silk pressed themselves against their lovers and dandled on their laps no one paid ned the least bit of attention ser rodrik waited below while littlefinger led him up to the third floor along a corridor and through a door inside catelyn was waiting she cried out when she saw him ran to him and embraced him fiercely my lady ned whispered in wonderment oh very good said littlefinger closing the door you recognized her i feared youd never come my lord she whispered against his chest petyr has been bringing me reports he told me of your troubles with arya and the young prince how are my girls both in mourning and full of anger he told her cat i do not understand what are you doing in kings landing whats happened ned asked his wife is it bran is he dead was the word that came to his lips but he could not say it it is bran but not as you think catelyn said ned was lost then how why are you here my love what is this place just what it appears littlefinger said easing himself onto a window seat a brothel can you think of a less likely place to find a catelyn tully he smiled as it chances i own this particular establishment so arrangements were easily made i am most anxious to keep the lannisters from learning that cat is here in kings landing why ned asked he saw her hands then the awkward way she held them the raw red scars the stiffness of the last two fingers on her left youve been hurt he took her hands in his own turned them over gods those are deep cuts a gash from a sword or how did this happen my lady catelyn slid a dagger out from under her cloak and placed it in his hand this blade was sent to open brans throat and spill his lifes blood neds head jerked up but who why would she put a finger to his lips let me tell it all my love it will go faster that way listen so he listened and she told it all from the fire in the library tower to varys and the guardsmen and littlefinger and when she was done eddard stark sat dazed beside the table the dagger in his hand brans wolf had saved the boys life he thought dully what was it that jon had said when they found the pups in the snow your children were meant to have these pups my lord and he had killed sansas and page for what was it guilt he was feeling or fear if the gods had sent these wolves what folly had he done painfully ned forced his thoughts back to the dagger and what it meant the imps dagger he repeated it made no sense his hand curled around the smooth dragonbone hilt and he slammed the blade into the table felt it bite into the wood it stood mocking him why should tyrion lannister want bran dead the boy has never done him harm do you starks have nought but snow between your ears littlefinger asked the imp would never have acted alone ned rose and paced the length of the room if the queen had a role in this or gods forbid the king himself no i will not believe that yet even as he said the words he remembered that chill morning on the barrowlands and roberts talk of sending hired knives after the targaryen princess he remembered rhaegars infant son the red ruin of his skull and the way the king had turned away as he had turned away in darrys audience hall not so long ago he could still hear sansa pleading as lyanna had pleaded once most likely the king did not know littlefinger said it would not be the first time our good robert is practiced at closing his eyes to things he would rather not see ned had no reply for that the face of the butchers boy swam up before his eyes cloven almost in two and afterward the king had said not a word his head was pounding littlefinger sauntered over to the table wrenched the knife from the wood the accusation is treason either way accuse the king and you will dance with ilyn payne before the words are out of your mouth the queen if you can find proof and if you can make robert listen then perhaps we have proof ned said we have the dagger this littlefinger flipped the knife casually end over end a sweet piece of steel but it cuts two ways my lord the imp will no doubt swear the blade was lost or stolen while he was at winterfell and with his hireling dead who is there to give him the lie he tossed the knife lightly to ned my counsel is to drop that in the river and forget that it was ever forged ned regarded him coldly lord baelish i am a stark of winterfell my son lies crippled perhaps dying he would be dead and catelyn with him but for a wolf pup we found in the snow if you truly believe i could forget that you are as big a fool now as when you took up sword against my brother a fool i may be stark yet im still here while your brother has been moldering in his frozen grave for some fourteen years now if you are so eager to molder beside him far be it from me to dissuade you but i would rather not be included in the party thank you very much you would be the last man i would willingly include in any party lord baelish you wound me deeply littlefinger placed a hand over his heart for my part i always found you starks a tiresome lot but cat seems to have become attached to you for reasons i cannot comprehend i shall try to keep you alive for her sake a fools task admittedly but i could never refuse your wife page anything littlefinger i should warn you stark we usually charge for that sort of thing around here a moment alone thats all i ask catelyn said very well littlefinger strolled to the door dont be too long it is past time the hand and i returned to the castle before our absence is noted catelyn went to him and took his hands in her own i will not forget the help you gave me petyr when your men came for me i did not know whether they were taking me to a friend or an enemy i have found you more than a friend i have found a brother id thought lost petyr baelish smiled i am desperately sentimental sweet lady best not tell anyone i have spent years convincing the court that i am wicked and cruel and i should hate to see all that hard work go for naught ned believed not a word of that but he kept his voice polite as he said you have my thanks as well lord baelish oh now theres a treasure littlefinger said exiting when the door had closed behind him ned turned back to his wife once you are home send word to helman tallhart and galbart glover under my seal they are to raise a hundred bowmen each and fortify moat cailin two hundred determined archers can hold the neck against an army instruct lord manderly that he is to strengthen and repair all his defenses at white harbor and see that they are well manned and from this day on i want a careful watch kept over theon greyjoy if there is war we shall have sore need of his fathers fleet war the fear was plain on catelyns face it will not come to that ned promised her praying it was true he took her in his arms again the lannisters are merciless in the face of weakness as aerys targaryen learned to his sorrow but they would not dare attack the north without all the power of the realm behind them and that they shall not have i must play out this fools masquerade as if nothing is amiss remember why i came here my love if i find proof that the lannisters murdered jon arryn he felt catelyn tremble in his arms her scarred hands clung to him if she said what then my love that was the most dangerous part ned knew all justice flows from the king he told her when i know the truth i must go to robert and pray that he is the man i think he is he finished silently and not the man i fear he has become tyrion are you certain that you must leave us so soon the lord commander asked him page past certain lord mormont tyrion replied my brother jaime will be wondering what has become of me he may decide that you have convinced me to take the black would that i could mormont picked up a crab claw and cracked it in his fist old as he was the lord commander still had the strength of a bear youre a cunning man tyrion we have need of men of your sort on the wall tyrion grinned then i shall scour the seven kingdoms for dwarfs and ship them all to you lord mormont as they laughed he sucked the meat from a crab leg and reached for another the crabs had arrived from eastwatch only this morning packed in a barrel of snow and they were succulent ser alliser thorne was the only man at table who did not so much as crack a smile lannister mocks us only you ser alliser tyrion said this time the laughter round the table had a nervous uncertain quality to it thornes black eyes fixed on tyrion with loathing you have a bold tongue for someone who is less than half a man perhaps you and i should visit the yard together why asked tyrion the crabs are here the remark brought more guffaws from the others ser alliser stood up his mouth a tight line come and make your j apes with steel in your hand tyrion looked pointedly at his right hand why i have steel in my hand ser alliser although it appears to be a crab fork shall we duel he hopped up on his chair and began poking at thornes chest with the tiny fork roars of laughter filled the tower room bits of crab flew from the lord commanders mouth as he began to gasp and choke even his raven joined in cawing loudly from above the window duel duel duel ser alliser thorne walked from the room so stiffly it looked as though he had a dagger up his butt mormont was still gasping for breath tyrion pounded him on the back to the victor goes the spoils he called out i claim thornes share of the crabs finally the lord commander recovered himself you are a wicked man to provoke our ser alliser so he scolded tyrion seated himself and took a sip of wine if a man paints a target on his chest he should expect that sooner or later someone will loose an arrow at him i have seen dead men with more humor than your ser alliser not so objected the lord steward bowen marsh a man as round and red as a pomegranate you ought to hear the droll names he gives the lads he trains tyrion had heard a few of those droll names ill wager the lads have a few names for him as well he said chip the ice off your eyes my good lords ser alliser thorne should be mucking out your stables not drilling your young warriors page the watch has no shortage of stableboys lord mormont grumbled that seems to be all they send us these days stableboys and sneak thieves and rapers ser alliser is an anointed knight one of the few to take the black since i have been lord commander he fought bravely at kings landing on the wrong side ser jaremy rykker commented dryly i ought to know i was there on the battlements beside him tywin lannister gave us a splendid choice take the black or see our heads on spikes before evenfall no offense intended tyrion none taken ser jaremy my father is very fond of spiked heads especially those of people who have annoyed him in some fashion and a face as noble as yours well no doubt he saw you decorating the city wall above the kings gate i think you would have looked very striking up there thank you ser jaremy replied with a sardonic smile lord commander mormont cleared his throat sometimes i fear ser alliser saw you true tyrion you do mock us and our noble purpose here tyrion shrugged we all need to be mocked from time to time lord mormont lest we start to take ourselves too seriously more wine please he held out his cup as rykker filled it for him bowen marsh said you have a great thirst for a small man oh i think that lord tyrion is quite a large man maester aemon said from the far end of the table he spoke softly yet the high officers of the nights watch all fell quiet the better to hear what the ancient had to say i think he is a giant come among us here at the end of the world tyrion answered gently ive been called many things my lord but giant is seldom one of them nonetheless maester aemon said as his clouded milkwhite eyes moved to tyrions face i think it is true for once tyrion lannister found himself at a loss for words he could only bow his head politely and say you are too kind maester aemon the blind man smiled he was a tiny thing wrinkled and hairless shrunken beneath the weight of a hundred years so his maesters collar with its links of many metals hung loose about his throat i have been called many things my lord he said but kind is seldom one of them this time tyrion himself led the laughter much later when the serious business of eating was done and the others had left mormont offered tyrion a chair beside the fire and a cup of mulled spirits so strong they brought tears to his eyes the kingsroad can be perilous this far north the lord commander told him as they drank i have jyck and morrec tyrion said and yoren is riding south again yoren is only one man the watch shall escort you as far as winterfell mormont announced in a tone that brooked no argument three men should be sufficient page if you insist my lord tyrion said you might send young snow he would be glad for a chance to see his brothers mormont frowned through his thick grey beard snow oh the stark bastard i think not the young ones need to forget the lives they left behind them the brothers and mothers and all that a visit home would only stir up feelings best left alone i know these things my own blood kin my sister maege rules bear island now since my sons dishonor i have nieces i have never seen he took a swallow besides jon snow is only a boy you shall have three strong swords to keep you safe i am touched by your concern lord mormont the strong drink was making tyrion lightheaded but not so drunk that he did not realize that the old bear wanted something from him i hope i can repay your kindness you can mormont said bluntly your sister sits beside the king your brother is a great knight and your father the most powerful lord in the seven kingdoms speak to them for us tell them of our need here you have seen for yourself my lord the nights watch is dying our strength is less than a thousand now six hundred here two hundred in the shadow tower even fewer at eastwatch and a scant third of those fighting men the wall is a hundred leagues long think on that should an attack come i have three men to defend each mile of wall three and a third tyrion said with a yawn mormont scarcely seemed to hear him the old man warmed his hands before the fire i sent benjen stark to search after yohn royces son lost on his first ranging the royce boy was green as summer grass yet he insisted on the honor of his own command saying it was his due as a knight i did not wish to offend his lord father so i yielded i sent him out with two men i deemed as good as any in the watch more fool u fool the raven agreed tyrion glanced up the bird peered down at him with those beady black eyes ruffling its wings fool it called again doubtless old mormont would take it amiss if he throttled the creature a pity the lord commander took no notice of the irritating bird gared was near as old as i am and longer on the wall he went on yet it would seem he forswore himself and fled i should never have believed it not of him but lord eddard sent me his head from winterfell of royce there is no word one deserter and two men lost and now ben stark too has gone missing he sighed deeply who am i to send searching after him in two years i will be seventy too old and too weary for the burden i bear yet if i set it down who will pick it up alliser thorne bowen marsh i would have to be as blind as maester aemon not to see what they are the nights watch has become an army of sullen boys and tired old men apart from the men at my table tonight i have perhaps twenty who can read and even fewer who can think or plan or lead once the watch spent its summers building and each lord commander raised the wall higher than he found it now it is all we can do to stay alive he was in deadly earnest tyrion realized he felt faintly embarrassed for the old man lord mormont page had spent a good part of his life on the wall and he needed to believe if those years were to have any meaning i promise the king will hear of your need tyrion said gravely and i will speak to my father and my brother jaime as well and he would tyrion lannister was as good as his word he left the rest unsaid that king robert would ignore him lord tywin would ask if he had taken leave of his senses and jaime would only laugh you are a young man tyrion mormont said how many winters have you seen he shrugged eight nine i misremember and all of them short as you say my lord he had been born in the dead of winter a terrible cruel one that the maesters said had lasted near three years but tyrions earliest memories were of spring when i was a boy it was said that a long summer always meant a long winter to come this summer has lasted nine years tyrion and a tenth will soon be upon us think on that when i was a boy tyrion replied my wet nurse told me that one day if men were good the gods would give the world a summer without ending perhaps weve been better than we thought and the great summer is finally at hand he grinned the lord commander did not seem amused you are not fool enough to believe that my lord already the days grow shorter there can be no mistake aemon has had letters from the citadel findings in accord with his own the end of summer stares us in the face mormont reached out and clutched tyrion tightly by the hand you must make them understand i tell you my lord the darkness is coming there are wild things in the woods direwolves and mammoths and snow bears the size of aurochs and i have seen darker shapes in my dreams in your dreams tyrion echoed thinking how badly he needed another strong drink mormont was deaf to the edge in his voice the fisherfolk near eastwatch have glimpsed white walkers on the shore this time tyrion could not hold his tongue the fisherfolk of lannisport often glimpse merlings denys mallister writes that the mountain people are moving south slipping past the shadow tower in numbers greater than ever before they are running my lord but running from what lord mormont moved to the window and stared out into the night these are old bones lannister but they have never felt a chill like this tell the king what i say i pray you winter is coming and when the long night falls only the nights watch will stand between the realm and the darkness that sweeps from the north the gods help us all if we are not ready the gods help me if i do not get some sleep tonight yoren is determined to ride at first light tyrion got to his feet sleepy from wine and tired of doom i thank you for all the courtesies you have done me lord mormont tell them tyrion tell them and make them believe that is all the thanks i need he whistled and his page raven flew to him and perched on his shoulder mormont smiled and gave the bird some corn from his pocket and that was how tyrion left him it was bitter cold outside bundled thickly in his furs tyrion lannister pulled on his gloves and nodded to the poor frozen wretches standing sentry outside the commanders keep he set off across the yard for his own chambers in the kings tower walking as briskly as his legs could manage patches of snow crunched beneath his feet as his boots broke the nights crust and his breath steamed before him like a banner he shoved his hands into his armpits and walked faster praying that morrec had remembered to warm his bed with hot bricks from the fire behind the kings tower the wall glimmered in the light of the moon immense and mysterious tyrion stopped for a moment to look up at it his legs ached of cold and haste suddenly a strange madness took hold of him a yearning to look once more off the end of the world it would be his last chance he thought tomorrow he would ride south and he could not imagine why he would ever want to return to this frozen desolation the kings tower was before him with its promise of warmth and a soft bed yet tyrion found himself walking past it toward the vast pale palisade of the wall a wooden stair ascended the south face anchored on huge roughhewn beams sunk deep into the ice and frozen in place back and forth it switched clawing its way upward as crooked as a bolt of lightning the black brothers assured him that it was much stronger than it looked but tyrions legs were cramping too badly for him to even contemplate the ascent he went instead to the iron cage beside the well clambered inside and yanked hard on the bell rope three quick pulls he had to wait what seemed an eternity standing there inside the bars with the wall to his back long enough for tyrion to begin to wonder why he was doing this he had just about decided to forget his sudden whim and go to bed when the cage gave a jerk and began to ascend he moved upward slowly by fits and starts at first then more smoothly the ground fell away beneath him the cage swung and tyrion wrapped his hands around the iron bars he could feel the cold of the metal even through his gloves morrec had a fire burning in his room he noted with approval but the lord commanders tower was dark the old bear had more sense than he did it seemed then he was above the towers still inching his way upward castle black lay below him etched in moonlight you could see how stark and empty it was from up here windowless keeps crumbling walls courtyards choked with broken stone farther off he could see the lights of moles town the little village half a league south along the kingsroad and here and there the bright glitter of moonlight on water where icy streams descended from the mountain heights to cut across the plains the rest of the world was a bleak emptiness of windswept hills and rocky fields spotted with snow finally a thick voice behind him said seven hells its the dwarf and the cage jerked to a sudden stop and hung there swinging slowly back and forth the ropes creaking bring him in damn it there was a grunt and a loud groaning of wood as the cage slid sideways and then the wall was beneath him tyrion waited until the swinging had stopped before he pushed open the cage door and hopped down onto the ice a heavy figure in black was leaning on the winch while a second held the cage with a gloved hand their faces were muffled in woolen scarves so only their eyes showed and they were plump with layers of wool and leather black on black and what will you be page wanting this time of night the one by the winch asked a last look the men exchanged sour glances look all you want the other one said just have a care you dont fall off little man the old bear would have our hides a small wooden shack stood under the great crane and tyrion saw the dull glow of a brazier and felt a brief gust of warmth when the winch men opened the door and went back inside and then he was alone it was bitingly cold up here and the wind pulled at his clothes like an insistent lover the top of the wall was wider than the kingsroad often was so tyrion had no fear of falling although the footing was slicker than he would have liked the brothers spread crushed stone across the walkways but the weight of countless footsteps would melt the wall beneath so the ice would seem to grow around the gravel swallowing it until the path was bare again and it was time to crush more stone still it was nothing that tyrion could not manage he looked off to the east and west at the wall stretching before him a vast white road with no beginning and no end and a dark abyss on either side west he decided for no special reason and he began to walk that way following the pathway nearest the north edge where the gravel looked freshest his bare cheeks were ruddy with the cold and his legs complained more loudly with every step but tyrion ignored them the wind swirled around him gravel crunched beneath his boots while ahead the white ribbon followed the lines of the hills rising higher and higher until it was lost beyond the western horizon he passed a massive catapult as tall as a city wall its base sunk deep into the wall the throwing arm had been taken off for repairs and then forgotten it lay there like a broken toy halfembedded in the ice on the far side of the catapult a muffled voice called out a challenge who goes there halt tyrion stopped if i halt too long ill freeze in place jon he said as a shaggy pale shape slid toward him silently and sniffed at his furs hello ghost jon snow moved closer he looked bigger and heavier in his layers of fur and leather the hood of his cloak pulled down over his face lannister he said yanking loose the scarf to uncover his mouth this is the last place i would have expected to see you he carried a heavy spear tipped in iron taller than he was and a sword hung at his side in a leather sheath across his chest was a gleaming black warhorn banded with silver this is the last place i would have expected to be seen tyrion admitted i was captured by a whim if i touch ghost will he chew my hand off not with me here jon promised tyrion scratched the white wolf behind the ears the red eyes watched him impassively the beast came up as high as his chest now another year and tyrion had the gloomy feeling hed be looking up at him what are you doing up here tonight he asked besides freezing your manhood off page i have drawn night guard jon said again ser alliser has kindly arranged for the watch commander to take a special interest in me he seems to think that if they keep me awake half the night ill fall asleep during morning drill so far i have disappointed him tyrion grinned and has ghost learned to juggle yet no said jon smiling but grenn held his own against halder this morning and pyp is no longer dropping his sword quite so often as he did pyp pypar is his real name the small boy with the large ears he saw me working with grenn and asked for help thorne had never even shown him the proper way to grip a sword he turned to look north i have a mile of wall to guard will you walk with me if you walk slowly tyrion said the watch commander tells me i must walk to keep my blood from freezing but he never said how fast they walked with ghost pacing along beside jon like a white shadow i leave on the morrow tyrion said i know jon sounded strangely sad i plan to stop at winterfell on the way south if there is any message that you would like me to deliver tell robb that im going to command the nights watch and keep him safe so he might as well take up needlework with the girls and have mikken melt down his sword for horseshoes your brother is bigger than me tyrion said with a laugh i decline to deliver any message that might get me killed rickon will ask when im coming home try to explain where ive gone if you can tell him he can have all my things while im away hell like that people seemed to be asking a great deal of him today tyrion lannister thought you could put all this in a letter you know rickon cant read yet bran he stopped suddenly i dont know what message to send to bran help him tyrion what help could i give him i am no maester to ease his pain i have no spells to give him back his legs you gave me help when i needed it jon snow said i gave you nothing tyrion said words page then give your words to bran too youre asking a lame man to teach a cripple how to dance tyrion said however sincere the lesson the result is likely to be grotesque still i know what it is to love a brother lord snow i will give bran whatever small help is in my power thank you my lord of lannister he pulled off his glove and offered his bare hand friend tyrion found himself oddly touched most of my kin are bastards he said with a wry smile but youre the first ive had to friend he pulled a glove off with his teeth and clasped snow by the hand flesh against flesh the boys grip was firm and strong when he had donned his glove again jon snow turned abruptly and walked to the low icy northern parapet beyond him the wall fell away sharply beyond him there was only the darkness and the wild tyrion followed him and side by side they stood upon the edge of the world the nights watch permitted the forest to come no closer than half a mile of the north face of the wall the thickets of ironwood and sentinel and oak that had once grown there had been harvested centuries ago to create a broad swath of open ground through which no enemy could hope to pass unseen tyrion had heard that elsewhere along the wall between the three fortresses the wildwood had come creeping back over the decades that there were places where greygreen sentinels and pale white weirwoods had taken root in the shadow of the wall itself but castle black had a prodigious appetite for firewood and here the forest was still kept at bay by the axes of the black brothers it was never far though from up here tyrion could see it the dark trees looming beyond the stretch of open ground like a second wall built parallel to the first a wall of night few axes had ever swung in that black wood where even the moonlight could not penetrate the ancient tangle of root and thorn and grasping limb out there the trees grew huge and the rangers said they seemed to brood and knew not men it was small wonder the nights watch named it the haunted forest as he stood there and looked at all that darkness with no fires burning anywhere with the wind blowing and the cold like a spear in his guts tyrion lannister felt as though he could almost believe the talk of the others the enemy in the night his jokes of grumkins and snarks no longer seemed quite so droll my uncle is out there jon snow said softly leaning on his spear as he stared off into the darkness the first night they sent me up here i thought uncle benjen will ride back tonight and ill see him first and blow the horn he never came though not that night and not any night give him time tyrion said far off to the north a wolf began to howl another voice picked up the call then another ghost cocked his head and listened if he doesnt come back jon snow promised ghost and i will go find him he put his hand on the direwolfs head i believe you tyrion said but what he thought was and who will go find you he shivered page arya her father had been fighting with the council again arya could see it on his face when he came to table late again as he had been so often the first course a thick sweet soup made with pumpkins had already been taken away when ned stark strode into the small hall they called it that to set it apart from the great hall where the king could feast a thousand but it was a long room with a high vaulted ceiling and bench space for two hundred at its trestle tables my lord jory said when father entered he rose to his feet and the rest of the guard rose with him each man wore a new cloak heavy grey wool with a white satin border a hand of beaten silver clutched the woolen folds of each cloak and marked their wearers as men of the hands household guard there were only fifty of them so most of the benches were empty be seated eddard stark said i see you have started without me i am pleased to know there are still some men of sense in this city he signaled for the meal to resume the servants began bringing out platters of ribs roasted in a crust of garlic and herbs the talk in the yard is we shall have a tourney my lord jory said as he resumed his seat they say that knights will come from all over the realm to joust and feast in honor of your appointment as hand of the king arya could see that her father was not very happy about that do they also say this is the last thing in the world i would have wished sansas eyes had grown wide as the plates a tourney she breathed she was seated between septa mordane and jeyne poole as far from arya as she could get without drawing a reproach from father will we be permitted to go father you know my feelings sansa it seems i must arrange roberts games and pretend to be honored for his sake that does not mean i must subject my daughters to this folly oh please sansa said i want to see septa mordane spoke up princess myrcella will be there my lord and her younger than lady sansa all the ladies of the court will be expected at a grand event like this and as the tourney is in your honor it would look queer if your family did not attend father looked pained i suppose so very well i shall arrange a place for you sansa he saw arya for both of you i dont care about their stupid tourney arya said she knew prince jofftey would be there and she hated prince joffrey sansa lifted her head it will be a splendid event you shant be wanted anger flashed across fathers face enough sansa more of that and you will change my mind i am page weary unto death of this endless war you two are fighting you are sisters i expect you to behave like sisters is that understood sansa bit her lip and nodded arya lowered her face to stare sullenly at her plate she could feel tears stinging her eyes she rubbed them away angrily determined not to cry the only sound was the clatter of knives and forks pray excuse me her father announced to the table i find i have small appetite tonight he walked from the hall after he was gone sansa exchanged excited whispers with jeyne poole down the table jory laughed at a joke and hullen started in about horseflesh your warhorse now he may not be the best one for the joust not the same thing oh no not the same at all the men had heard it all before desmond jacks and hullens son harwin shouted him down together and porther called for more wine no one talked to arya she didnt care she liked it that way she would have eaten her meals alone in her bedchamber if they let her sometimes they did when father had to dine with the king or some lord or the envoys from this place or that place the rest of the time they ate in his solar just him and her and sansa that was when arya missed her brothers most she wanted to tease bran and play with baby rickon and have robb smile at her she wanted jon to muss up her hair and call her little sister and finish her sentences with her but all of them were gone she had no one left but sansa and sansa wouldnt even talk to her unless father made her back at winterfell they had eaten in the great hall almost half the time her father used to say that a lord needed to eat with his men if he hoped to keep them know the men who follow you she heard him tell robb once and let them know you dont ask your men to die for a stranger at winterfell he always had an extra seat set at his own table and every day a different man would be asked to join him one night it would be vayon poole and the talk would be coppers and bread stores and servants the next time it would be mikken and her father would listen to him go on about armor and swords and how hot a forge should be and the best way to temper steel another day it might be hullen with his endless horse talk or septon chayle from the library or jory or ser rodrik or even old nan with her stories arya had loved nothing better than to sit at her fathers table and listen to them talk she had loved listening to the men on the benches too to freeriders tough as leather courtly knights and bold young squires grizzled old menatarms she used to throw snowballs at them and help them steal pies from the kitchen their wives gave her scones and she invented names for their babies and played monstersandmaidens and hidethetreasure and comeintomycastle with their children fat tom used to call her arya underfoot because he said that was where she always was shed liked that a lot better than arya horseface only that was winterfell a world away and now everything was changed this was the first time they had supped with the men since arriving in kings landing arya hated it she hated the sounds of their voices now the way they laughed the stories they told theyd been her friends shed felt safe around them but now she knew that was a lie theyd let the queen kill lady that was horrible enough but then the hound found mycah jeyne poole had told arya that hed cut him up in so many pieces that theyd given him back to the butcher in a bag and at first the poor man had thought it was a pig theyd slaughtered and no one had raised a voice or drawn a blade or anything not harwin who always talked so bold or alyn who was going to be a knight or jory who was captain of the guard not even her father page he was my ffiend arya whispered into her plate so low that no one could hear her ribs sat there untouched grown cold now a thin film of grease congealing beneath them on the plate arya looked at them and felt ill she pushed away from the table pray where do you think you are going young lady septa mordane asked im not hungry arya found it an effort to remember her courtesies may i be excused please she recited stiffly you may not the septa said you have scarcely touched your food you will sit down and clean your plate you clean it before anyone could stop her arya bolted for the door as the men laughed and septa mordane called loudly after her her voice rising higher and higher fat tom was at his post guarding the door to the tower of the hand he blinked when he saw arya rushing toward him and heard the septas shouts here now little one hold on he started to say reaching but arya slid between his legs and then she was running up the winding tower steps her feet hammering on the stone while fat tom huffed and puffed behind her her bedchamber was the only place that arya liked in all of kings landing and the thing she liked best about it was the door a massive slab of dark oak with black iron bands when she slammed that door and dropped the heavy crossbar nobody could get into her room not septa mordane or fat tom or sansa or jory or the hound nobody she slammed it now when the bar was down arya finally felt safe enough to cry she went to the window seat and sat there sniffling hating them all and herself most of all it was all her fault everything bad that had happened sansa said so and jeyne too fat tom was knocking on her door arya girl whats wrong he called out you in there no she shouted the knocking stopped a moment later she heard him going away fat tom was always easy to fool arya went to the chest at the foot of her bed she knelt opened the lid and began pulling her clothes out with both hands grabbing handfuls of silk and satin and velvet and wool and tossing them on the floor it was there at the bottom of the chest where shed hidden it arya lifted it out almost tenderly and drew the slender blade from its sheath needle she thought of mycah again and her eyes filled with tears her fault her fault her fault if she had never asked him to play at swords with her there was a pounding at her door louder than before arya stark you open this door at once do you hear me page arya spun around with needle in her hand you better not come in here she warned she slashed at the air savagely the hand will hear of this septa mordane raged i dont care arya screamed go away you will rue this insolent behavior young lady i promise you that arya listened at the door until she heard the sound of the septas receding footsteps she went back to the window needle in hand and looked down into the courtyard below if only she could climb like bran she thought she would go out the window and down the tower run away from this horrible place away from sansa and septa mordane and prince joffrey from all of them steal some food from the kitchens take needle and her good boots and a warm cloak she could find nymeria in the wild woods below the trident and together theyd return to winterfell or run to jon on the wall she found herself wishing that jon was here with her now then maybe she wouldnt feel so alone a soft knock at the door behind her turned arya away from the window and her dreams of escape arya her fathers voice called out open the door we need to talk arya crossed the room and lifted the crossbar father was alone he seemed more sad than angry that made arya feel even worse may i come in arya nodded then dropped her eyes ashamed father closed the door whose sword is that mine arya had almost forgotten needle in her hand give it to me reluctantly arya surrendered her sword wondering if she would ever hold it again her father turned it in the light examining both sides of the blade he tested the point with his thumb a bravos blade he said yet it seems to me that i know this makers mark this is mikkens work arya could not lie to him she lowered her eyes lord eddard stark sighed my nineyearold daughter is being armed from my own forge and i know nothing of it the hand of the king is expected to rule the seven kingdoms yet it seems i cannot even rule my own household how is it that you come to own a sword arya where did you get this arya chewed her lip and said nothing she would not betray jon not even to their father after a while father said i dont suppose it matters truly he looked down gravely at the sword in his hands this is no toy for children least of all for a girl what would septa mordane say if she knew you were playing with swords i wasnt playing arya insisted i hate septa mordane page thats enough her fathers voice was curt and hard the septa is doing no more than is her duty though gods know you have made it a struggle for the poor woman your mother and i have charged her with the impossible task of making you a lady i dont want to be a lady arya flared i ought to snap this toy across my knee here and now and put an end to this nonsense needle wouldnt break arya said defiantly but her voice betrayed her words it has a name does it her father sighed ah arya you have a wildness in you child the wolf blood my father used to call it lyanna had a touch of it and my brother brandon more than a touch it brought them both to an early grave arya heard sadness in his voice he did not often speak of his father or of the brother and sister who had died before she was born lyanna might have carried a sword if my lord father had allowed it you remind me of her sometimes you even look like her lyanna was beautiful arya said startled everybody said so it was not a thing that was ever said of arya she was eddard stark agreed beautiful and willful and dead before her time he lifted the sword held it out between them arya what did you think to do with this needle who did you hope to skewer your sister septa mordane do you know the first thing about sword fighting all she could think of was the lesson jon had given her stick them with the pointy end she blurted out her father snorted back laughter that is the essence of it i suppose arya desperately wanted to explain to make him see i was trying to learn but her eyes filled with tears i asked mycah to practice with me the grief came on her all at once she turned away shaking i asked him she cried it was my fault it was me suddenly her fathers arms were around her he held her gently as she turned to him and sobbed against his chest no sweet one he murmured grieve for your friend but never blame yourself you did not kill the butchers boy that murder lies at the hounds door him and the cruel woman he serves i hate them arya confided redfaced sniffling the hound and the queen and the king and prince joffrey i hate all of them joffrey lied it wasnt the way he said i hate sansa too she did remember she just lied so joffrey would like her we all lie her father said or did you truly think id believe that nymeria ran off arya blushed guiltily jory promised not to tell jory kept his word her father said with a smile there are some things i do not need to be told even a blind man could see that wolf would never have left you willingly we had to throw rocks she said miserably i told her to run to go be free that i didnt want her page anymore there were other wolves for her to play with we heard them howling and jory said the woods were full of game so shed have deer to hunt only she kept following and finally we had to throw rocks i hit her twice she whined and looked at me and i felt so shamed but it was right wasnt it the queen would have killed her it was right her father said and even the lie was not without honor hed put needle aside when he went to arya to embrace her now he took the blade up again and walked to the window where he stood for a moment looking out across the courtyard when he turned back his eyes were thoughtful he seated himself on the window seat needle across his lap arya sit down i need to try and explain some things to you she perched anxiously on the edge of her bed you are too young to be burdened with all my cares he told her but you are also a stark of winterfell you know our words winter is coming arya whispered the hard cruel times her father said we tasted them on the trident child and when bran fell you were born in the long summer sweet one youve never known anything else but now the winter is truly coming remember the sigil of our house arya the direwolf she said thinking of nymeria she hugged her knees against her chest suddenly afraid let me tell you something about wolves child when the snows fall and the white winds blow the lone wolf dies but the pack survives summer is the time for squabbles in winter we must protect one another keep each other warm share our strengths so if you must hate arya hate those who would truly do us harm septa mordane is a good woman and sansa sansa is your sister you may be as different as the sun and the moon but the same blood flows through both your hearts you need her as she needs you and i need both of you gods help me he sounded so tired that it made arya sad i dont hate sansa she told him not truly it was only half a lie i do not mean to frighten you but neither will i lie to you we have come to a dark dangerous place child this is not winterfell we have enemies who mean us ill we cannot fight a war among ourselves this willfulness of yours the running off the angry words the disobedience at home these were only the summer games of a child here and now with winter soon upon us that is a different matter it is time to begin growing up i will arya vowed she had never loved him so much as she did in that instant i can be strong too i can be as strong as robb he held needle out to her hilt first here she looked at the sword with wonder in her eyes for a moment she was afraid to touch it afraid that if she reached for it it would be snatched away again but then her father said go on its yours and she took it in her hand i can keep it she said for true page for true he smiled if i took it away no doubt id find a morningstar hidden under your pillow within the fortnight try not to stab your sister whatever the provocation i wont i promise arya clutched needle tightly to her chest as her father took his leave the next morning as they broke their fast she apologized to septa mordane and asked for her pardon the septa peered at her suspiciously but father nodded three days later at midday her fathers steward vayon poole sent arya to the small hall the trestle tables had been dismantled and the benches shoved against the walls the hall seemed empty until an unfamiliar voice said you are late boy a slight man with a bald head and a great beak of a nose stepped out of the shadows holding a pair of slender wooden swords tomorrow you will be here at midday he had an accent the lilt of the free cities braavos perhaps or myr who are you arya asked i am your dancing master he tossed her one of the wooden blades she grabbed for it missed and heard it clatter to the floor tomorrow you will catch it now pick it up it was not just a stick but a true wooden sword complete with grip and guard and pommel arya picked it up and clutched it nervously with both hands holding it out in front of her it was heavier than it looked much heavier than needle the bald man clicked his teeth together that is not the way boy this is not a greatsword that is needing two hands to swing it you will take the blade in one hand its too heavy arya said it is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong and for the balancing a hollow inside is filled with lead just so one hand now is all that is needing arya took her right hand off the grip and wiped her sweaty palm on her pants she held the sword in her left hand he seemed to approve the left is good all is reversed it will make your enemies more awkward now you are standing wrong turn your body sideface yes so you are skinny as the shaft of a spear do you know that is good too the target is smaller now the grip let me see he moved closer and peered at her hand prying her fingers apart rearranging them just so yes do not squeeze it so tight no the grip must be deft delicate what if i drop it arya said the steel must be part of your arm the bald man told her can you drop part of your arm no nine years syrio forel was first sword to the sealord of braavos he knows these things listen to him boy it was the third time he had called her boy im a girl arya objected boy girl syrio forel said you are a sword that is all he clicked his teeth together just so that is the grip you are not holding a battleaxe you are holding a page needle arya finished for him fiercely just so now we will begin the dance remember child this is not the iron dance of westeros we are learning the knights dance hacking and hammering no this is the bravos dance the water dance swift and sudden all men are made of water do you know this when you pierce them the water leaks out and they die he took a step backward raised his own wooden blade now you will try to strike me arya tried to strike him she tried for four hours until every muscle in her body was sore and aching while syrio forel clicked his teeth together and told her what to do the next day their real work began daenerys the dothraki sea ser jorah mormont said as he reined to a halt beside her on the top of the ridge beneath them the plain stretched out immense and empty a vast flat expanse that reached to the distant horizon and beyond it was a sea dany thought past here there were no hills no mountains no trees nor cities nor roads only the endless grasses the tall blades rippling like waves when the winds blew its so green she said here and now ser jorah agreed you ought to see it when it blooms all dark red flowers from horizon to horizon like a sea of blood come the dry season and the world turns the color of old bronze and this is only hranna child there are a hundred kinds of grass out there grasses as yellow as lemon and as dark as indigo blue grasses and orange grasses and grasses like rainbows down in the shadow lands beyond asshai they say there are oceans of ghost grass taller than a man on horseback with stalks as pale as milkglass it murders all other grass and glows in the dark with the spirits of the damned the dothraki claim that someday ghost grass will cover the entire world and then all life will end that thought gave dany the shivers i dont want to talk about that now she said its so beautiful here i dont want to think about everything dying as you will khaleesi ser jorah said respectfully she heard the sound of voices and turned to look behind her she and mormont had outdistanced the rest of their party and now the others were climbing the ridge below them her handmaid irri and the young archers of her khas were fluid as centaurs but viserys still struggled with the short stirrups and the flat saddle her brother was miserable out here he ought never have come magister illyrio had urged him to wait in pentos had offered him the hospitality of his manse but viserys would have none of it he would stay with drogo until the debt had been paid until he had the crown he had been promised and if he tries to cheat me he will learn to his sorrow what it means to wake the dragon viserys had vowed laying a hand on his borrowed sword illyrio had blinked at that and wished him good fortune dany realized that she did not want to listen to any of her brothers complaints right now the day was too perfect the sky was a deep blue and high above them a hunting hawk circled the grass sea swayed and sighed with each breath of wind the air was warm on her face and dany felt at peace she page would not let viserys spoil it wait here dany told ser jorah tell them all to stay tell them i command it the knight smiled ser jorah was not a handsome man he had a neck and shoulders like a bull and coarse black hair covered his arms and chest so thickly that there was none left for his head yet his smiles gave dany comfort you are learning to talk like a queen daenerys not a queen said dany a khaleesi she wheeled her horse about and galloped down the ridge alone the descent was steep and rocky but dany rode fearlessly and the joy and the danger of it were a song in her heart all her life viserys had told her she was a princess but not until she rode her silver had daenerys targaryen ever felt like one at first it had not come easy the khalasar had broken camp the morning after her wedding moving east toward vaes dothrak and by the third day dany thought she was going to die saddle sores opened on her bottom hideous and bloody her thighs were chafed raw her hands blistered from the reins the muscles of her legs and back so wracked with pain that she could scarcely sit by the time dusk fell her handmaids would need to help her down from her mount even the nights brought no relief khal drogo ignored her when they rode even as he had ignored her during their wedding and spent his evenings drinking with his warriors and bloodriders racing his prize horses watching women dance and men die dany had no place in these parts of his life she was left to sup alone or with ser jorah and her brother and afterward to cry herself to sleep yet every night some time before the dawn drogo would come to her tent and wake her in the dark to ride her as relentlessly as he rode his stallion he always took her from behind dothraki fashion for which dany was grateful that way her lord husband could not see the tears that wet her face and she could use her pillow to muffle her cries of pain when he was done he would close his eyes and begin to snore softly and dany would lie beside him her body bruised and sore hurting too much for sleep day followed day and night followed night until dany knew she could not endure a moment longer she would kill herself rather than go on she decided one night yet when she slept that night she dreamt the dragon dream again viserys was not in it this time there was only her and the dragon its scales were black as night wet and slick with blood her blood dany sensed its eyes were pools of molten magma and when it opened its mouth the flame came roaring out in a hot jet she could hear it singing to her she opened her arms to the fire embraced it let it swallow her whole let it cleanse her and temper her and scour her clean she could feel her flesh sear and blacken and slough away could feel her blood boil and turn to steam and yet there was no pain she felt strong and new and fierce and the next day strangely she did not seem to hurt quite so much it was as if the gods had heard her and taken pity even her handmaids noticed the change khaleesi jhiqui said what is wrong are you sick i was she answered standing over the dragons eggs that illyrio had given her when she wed she page touched one the largest of the three running her hand lightly over the shelf blackandscarlet she thought like the dragon in my dream the stone felt strangely warm beneath her fingers or was she still dreaming she pulled her hand back nervously from that hour onward each day was easier than the one before it her legs grew stronger her blisters burst and her hands grew callused her soft thighs toughened supple as leather the khal had commanded the handmaid irri to teach dany to ride in the dothraki fashion but it was the filly who was her real teacher the horse seemed to know her moods as if they shared a single mind with every passing day dany felt surer in her seat the dothraki were a hard and unsentimental people and it was not their custom to name their animals so dany thought of her only as the silver she had never loved anything so much as the riding became less an ordeal dany began to notice the beauties of the land around her she rode at the head of the khalasar with drogo and his bloodriders so she came to each country fresh and unspoiled behind them the great horde might tear the earth and muddy the rivers and send up clouds of choking dust but the fields ahead of them were always green and verdant they crossed the rolling hills of norvos past terraced farms and small villages where the townsfolk watched anxiously from atop white stucco walls they forded three wide placid rivers and a fourth that was swift and narrow and treacherous camped beside a high blue waterfall skirted the tumbled ruins of a vast dead city where ghosts were said to moan among blackened marble columns they raced down valyrian roads a thousand years old and straight as a dothraki arrow for half a moon they rode through the forest of qohor where the leaves made a golden canopy high above them and the trunks of the trees were as wide as city gates there were great elk in that wood and spotted tigers and lemurs with silver fur and huge purple eyes but all fled before the approach of the khalasar and dany got no glimpse of them by then her agony was a fading memory she still ached after a long days riding yet somehow the pain had a sweetness to it now and each morning she came willingly to her saddle eager to know what wonders waited for her in the lands ahead she began to find pleasure even in her nights and if she still cried out when drogo took her it was not always in pain at the bottom of the ridge the grasses rose around her tall and supple dany slowed to a trot and rode out onto the plain losing herself in the green blessedly alone in the khalasar she was never alone khal drogo came to her only after the sun went down but her handmaids fed her and bathed her and slept by the door of her tent drogos bloodriders and the men of her khas were never far and her brother was an unwelcome shadow day and night dany could hear him on the top of the ridge his voice shrill with anger as he shouted at ser jorah she rode on submerging herself deeper in the dothraki sea the green swallowed her up the air was rich with the scents of earth and grass mixed with the smell of horseflesh and danys sweat and the oil in her hair dothraki smells they seemed to belong here dany breathed it all in laughing she had a sudden urge to feel the ground beneath her to curl her toes in that thick black soil swinging down from her saddle she let the silver graze while she pulled off her high boots page viserys came upon her as sudden as a summer storm his horse rearing beneath him as he reined up too hard you dare he screamed at her you give commands to me to me he vaulted off the horse stumbling as he landed his face was flushed as he struggled back to his feet he grabbed her shook her have you forgotten who you are look at you look at you dany did not need to look she was barefoot with oiled hair wearing dothraki riding leathers and a painted vest given her as a bride gift she looked as though she belonged here viserys was soiled and stained in city silks and ringmail he was still screaming you do not command the dragon do you understand i am the lord of the seven kingdoms i will not hear orders from some horselords slut do you hear me his hand went under her vest his fingers digging painfully into her breast do you hear me dany shoved him away hard viserys stared at her his lilac eyes incredulous she had never defied him never fought back rage twisted his features he would hurt her now and badly she knew that crack the whip made a sound like thunder the coil took viserys around the throat and yanked him backward he went sprawling in the grass stunned and choking the dothraki riders hooted at him as he struggled to free himself the one with the whip young jhogo rasped a question dany did not understand his words but by then irri was there and ser jorah and the rest of her khas jhogo asks if you would have him dead khaleesi irri said no dany replied no jhogo understood that one of the others barked out a comment and the dothraki laughed irri told her quaro thinks you should take an ear to teach him respect her brother was on his knees his fingers digging under the leather coils crying incoherently struggling for breath the whip was tight around his windpipe tell them i do not wish him harmed dany said irri repeated her words in dothraki jhogo gave a pull on the whip yanking viserys around like a puppet on a string he went sprawling again freed from the leather embrace a thin line of blood under his chin where the whip had cut deep i warned him what would happen my lady ser jorah mormont said i told him to stay on the ridge as you commanded i know you did dany replied watching viserys he lay on the ground sucking in air noisily redfaced and sobbing he was a pitiful thing he had always been a pitiful thing why had she never seen that before there was a hollow place inside her where her fear had been take his horse dany commanded ser jorah viserys gaped at her he could not believe what he was page hearing nor could dany quite believe what she was saying yet the words came let my brother walk behind us back to the khalasar among the dothraki the man who does not ride was no man at all the lowest of the low without honor or pride let everyone see him as he is no viserys screamed he turned to ser jorah pleading in the common tongue with words the horsemen would not understand hit her mormont hurt her your king commands it kill these dothraki dogs and teach her the exile knight looked from dany to her brother she barefoot with dirt between her toes and oil in her hair he with his silks and steel dany could see the decision on his face he shall walk khaleesi he said he took her brothers horse in hand while dany remounted her silver viserys gaped at him and sat down in the dirt he kept his silence but he would not move and his eyes were full of poison as they rode away soon he was lost in the tall grass when they could not see him anymore dany grew afraid will he find his way back she asked ser jorah as they rode even a man as blind as your brother should be able to follow our trail he replied he is proud he may be too shamed to come back jorah laughed where else should he go if he cannot find the khalasar the khalasar will most surely find him it is hard to drown in the dothraki sea child dany saw the truth of that the khalasar was like a city on the march but it did not march blindly always scouts ranged far ahead of the main column alert for any sign of game or prey or enemies while outriders guarded their flanks they missed nothing not here in this land the place where they had come from these plains were a part of them and of her now i hit him she said wonder in her voice now that it was over it seemed like some strange dream that she had dreamed ser jorah do you think hell be so angry when he gets back she shivered i woke the dragon didnt it ser jorah snorted can you wake the dead girl your brother rhaegar was the last dragon and he died on the trident viserys is less than the shadow of a snake his blunt words startled her it seemed as though all the things she had always believed were suddenly called into question you you swore him your sword that i did girl ser jorah said and if your brother is the shadow of a snake what does that make his servants his voice was bitter he is still the true king he is jorah pulled up his horse and looked at her truth now would you want to see viserys sit a throne dany thought about that he would not be a very good king would he there have been worse but not many the knight gave his heels to his mount and started off again page dany rode close beside him still she said the common people are waiting for him magister illyrio says they are sewing dragon banners and praying for viserys to return from across the narrow sea to free them the common people pray for rain healthy children and a summer that never ends ser jorah told her it is no matter to them if the high lords play their game of thrones so long as they are left in peace he gave a shrug they never are dany rode along quietly for a time working his words like a puzzle box it went against everything that viserys had ever told her to think that the people could care so little whether a true king or a usurper reigned over them yet the more she thought on jorahs words the more they rang of truth what do you pray for ser jorah she asked him home he said his voice was thick with longing i pray for home too she told him believing it ser jorah laughed look around you then khaleesi but it was not the plains dany saw then it was kings landing and the great red keep that aegon the conqueror had built it was dragonstone where she had been born in her minds eye they burned with a thousand lights a fire blazing in every window in her minds eye all the doors were red my brother will never take back the seven kingdoms dany said she had known that for a long time she realized she had known it all her life only she had never let herself say the words even in a whisper but now she said them for jorah mormont and all the world to hear a gaml of thronls ser jorah gave her a measuring look you think not he could not lead an army even if my lord husband gave him one dany said he has no coin and the only knight who follows him reviles him as less than a snake the dothraki make mock of his weakness he will never take us home wise child the knight smiled i am no child she told him fiercely her heels pressed into the sides of her mount rousing the silver to a gallop faster and faster she raced leaving jorah and irri and the others far behind the warm wind in her hair and the setting sun red on her face by the time she reached the khalasar it was dusk the slaves had erected her tent by the shore of a springfed pool she could hear rough voices from the woven grass palace on the hill soon there would be laughter when the men of her khas told the story of what had happened in the grasses today by the time viserys came limping back among them every man woman and child in the camp would know him for a walker there were no secrets in the khalasar dany gave the silver over to the slaves for grooming and entered her tent it was cool and dim beneath the silk as she let the door flap close behind her dany saw a finger of dusty red light reach out to touch her dragons eggs across the tent for an instant a thousand droplets of scarlet flame swam before her eyes she blinked and they were gone page stone she told herself they are only stone even illyrio said so the dragons are all dead she put her palm against the black egg fingers spread gently across the curve of the shell the stone was warm almost hot the sun dany whispered the sun warmed them as they rode she commanded her handmaids to prepare her a bath doreah built a fire outside the tent while irri and jhiqui fetched the big copper tubanother bride giftfrom the packhorses and carried water from the pool when the bath was steaming irri helped her into it and climbed in after her have you ever seen a dragon she asked as irri scrubbed her back and jhiqui sluiced sand from her hair she had heard that the first dragons had come from the east from the shadow lands beyond asshai and the islands of the jade sea perhaps some were still living there in realms strange and wild dragons are gone khaleesi irri said dead agreed jhiqui long and long ago viserys had told her that the last targaryen dragons had died no more than a century and a half ago during the reign of aegon who was called the dragonbane that did not seem so long ago to dany everywhere she said disappointed even in the east magic had died in the west when the doom fell on valyria and the lands of the long summer and neither spellforged steel nor stormsingers nor dragons could hold it back but dany had always heard that the east was different it was said that manticores prowled the islands of the jade sea that basilisks infested the jungles of yi ti that spellsingers warlocks and aeromancers practiced their arts openly in asshai while shadowbinders and bloodmages worked terrible sorceries in the black of night why shouldnt there be dragons too no dragon irri said brave men kill them for dragon terrible evil beasts it is known it is known agreed jhiqui a trader from qarth once told me that dragons came from the moon blond doreah said as she warmed a towel over the fire jhiqui and irri were of an age with dany dothraki girls taken as slaves when drogo destroyed their fathers khalasar doreah was older almost twenty magister illyrio had found her in a pleasure house in lys silverywet hair tumbled across her eyes as dany turned her head curious the moon he told me the moon was an egg khaleesi the lysene girl said once there were two moons in the sky but one wandered too close to the sun and cracked from the heat a thousand thousand dragons poured forth and drank the fire of the sun that is why dragons breathe flame one day the other moon will kiss the sun too and then it will crack and the dragons will return the two dothraki girls giggled and laughed you are foolish strawhead slave irri said moon is no egg moon is god woman wife of sun it is known it is known jhiqui agreed page danys skin was flushed and pink when she climbed from the tub jhiqui laid her down to oil her body and scrape the dirt from her pores afterward irri sprinkled her with spiceflower and cinnamon while doreah brushed her hair until it shone like spun silver she thought about the moon and eggs and dragons her supper was a simple meal of fruit and cheese and fry bread with a jug of honeyed wine to wash it down doreah stay and eat with me dany commanded when she sent her other handmaids away the lysene girl had hair the color of honey and eyes like the summer sky she lowered those eyes when they were alone you honor me khaleesi she said but it was no honor only service long after the moon had risen they sat together talking that night when khal drogo came dany was waiting for him he stood in the door of her tent and looked at her with surprise she rose slowly and opened her sleeping silks and let them fall to the ground this night we must go outside my lord she told him for the dothraki believed that all things of importance in a mans life must be done beneath the open sky khal drogo followed her out into the moonlight the bells in his hair tinkling softly a few yards from her tent was a bed of soft grass and it was there that dany drew him down when he tried to turn her over she put a hand on his chest no she said this night i would look on your face there is no privacy in the heart of the khalasar dany felt the eyes on her as she undressed him heard the soft voices as she did the things that doreah had told her to do it was nothing to her was she not khaleesi his were the only eyes that mattered and when she mounted him she saw something there that she had never seen before she rode him as fiercely as ever she had ridden her silver and when the moment of his pleasure came khal drogo called out her name they were on the far side of the dothraki sea when jhiqui brushed the soft swell of danys stomach with her fingers and said khaleesi you are with child i know dany told her it was her fourteenth name day bran in the yard below rickon ran with the wolves bran watched from his window seat wherever the boy went grey wind was there first loping ahead to cut him off until rickon saw him screamed in delight and went pelting off in another direction shaggydog ran at his heels spinning and snapping if the other wolves came too close his fur had darkened until he was all black and his eyes were green fire brans summer came last he was silver and smoke with eyes of yellow gold that saw all there was to see smaller than grey wind and more wary bran thought he was the smartest of the litter he could hear his brothers breathless laughter as rickon dashed across the hardpacked earth on little baby legs page his eyes stung he wanted to be down there laughing and running angry at the thought bran knuckled away the tears before they could fall his eighth name day had come and gone he was almost a man grown now too old to cry it was just a lie he said bitterly remembering the crow from his dream i cant fly i cant even run crows are all liars old nan agreed from the chair where she sat doing her needlework i know a story about a crow i dont want any more stories bran snapped his voice petulant he had liked old nan and her stories once before but it was different now they left her with him all day now to watch over him and clean him and keep him from being lonely but she just made it worse i hate your stupid stories the old woman smiled at him toothlessly my stories no my little lord not mine the stories are before me and after me before you too she was a very ugly old woman bran thought spitefully shrunken and wrinkled almost blind too weak to climb stairs with only a few wisps of white hair left to cover a mottled pink scalp no one really knew how old she was but his father said shed been called old nan even when he was a boy she was the oldest person in winterfell for certain maybe the oldest person in the seven kingdoms nan had come to the castle as a wet nurse for a brandon stark whose mother had died birthing him he had been an older brother of lord rickard brans grandfather or perhaps a younger brother or a brother to lord rickards father sometimes old nan told it one way and sometimes another in all the stories the little boy died at three of a summer chill but old nan stayed on at winterfell with her own children she had lost both her sons to the war when king robert won the throne and her grandson was killed on the walls of pyke during balon greyjoys rebellion her daughters had long ago married and moved away and died all that was left of her own blood was hodor the simpleminded giant who worked in the stables but old nan just lived on and on doing her needlework and telling her stories i dont care whose stories they are bran told her i hate them he didnt want stories and he didnt want old nan he wanted his mother and father he wanted to go running with summer loping beside him he wanted to climb the broken tower and feed corn to the crows he wanted to ride his pony again with his brothers he wanted it to be the way it had been before i know a story about a boy who hated stories old nan said with her stupid little smile her needles moving all the while click click click until bran was ready to scream at her it would never be the way it had been he knew the crow had tricked him into flying but when he woke up he was broken and the world was changed they had all left him his father and his mother and his sisters and even his bastard brother jon his father had promised he would ride a real horse to kings landing but theyd gone without him maester luwin had sent a bird after lord eddard with a message and another to mother and a third to jon on the wall but there had been no answers ofttimes the birds are lost child the maester had told him theres many a mile and many a hawk between here and kings landing the message may not have reached them yet to bran it felt as if they had all died while he had slept or perhaps bran had died and they had page forgotten him jory and ser rodrik and vayon poole had gone too and hullen and harwin and fat tom and a quarter of the guard only robb and baby rickon were still here and robb was changed he was robb the lord now or trying to be he wore a real sword and never smiled his days were spent drilling the guard and practicing his swordplay making the yard ring with the sound of steel as bran watched forlornly from his window at night he closeted himself with maester luwin talking or going over account books sometimes he would ride out with hallis mollen and be gone for days at a time visiting distant holdfasts whenever he was away more than a day rickon would cry and ask bran if robb was ever coming back even when he was home at winterfell robb the lord seemed to have more time for hallis mollen and theon greyjoy than he ever did for his brothers i could tell you the story about brandon the builder old nan said that was always your favorite thousands and thousands of years ago brandon the builder had raised winterfell and some said the wall bran knew the story but it had never been his favorite maybe one of the other brandons had liked that story sometimes nan would talk to him as if he were her brandon the baby she had nursed all those years ago and sometimes she confused him with his uncle brandon who was killed by the mad king before bran was even born she had lived so long mother had told him once that all the brandon starks had become one person in her head thats not my favorite he said my favorites were the scary ones he heard some sort of commotion outside and turned back to the window rickon was running across the yard toward the gatehouse the wolves following him but the tower faced the wrong way for bran to see what was happening he smashed a fist on his thigh in frustration and felt nothing oh my sweet summer child old nan said quietly what do you know of fear fear is for the winter my little lord when the snows fall a hundred feet deep and the ice wind comes howling out of the north fear is for the long night when the sun hides its face for years at a time and little children are born and live and die all in darkness while the direwolves grow gaunt and hungry and the white walkers move through the woods you mean the others bran said querulously the others old nan agreed thousands and thousands of years a gaml of thronls ago a winter fell that was cold and hard and endless beyond all memory of man there came a night that lasted a generation and kings shivered and died in their castles even as the swineherds in their hovels women smothered their children rather than see them starve and cried and felt their tears freeze on their cheeks her voice and her needles fell silent and she glanced up at bran with pale filmy eyes and asked so child this is the sort of story you like well bran said reluctantly yes only old nan nodded in that darkness the others came for the first time she said as her needles went click click click they were cold things dead things that hated iron and fire and the touch of the sun and every creature with hot blood in its veins they swept over holdfasts and cities and kingdoms felled heroes and armies by the score riding their pale dead horses and leading hosts of the slain all the swords of men could not stay their advance and even maidens and suckling babes found no pity in them page they hunted the maids through frozen forests and fed their dead servants on the flesh of human children her voice had dropped very low almost to a whisper and bran found himself leaning forward to listen now these were the days before the andals came and long before the women fled across the narrow sea from the cities of the rhoyne and the hundred kingdoms of those times were the kingdoms of the first men who had taken these lands from the children of the forest yet here and there in the fastness of the woods the children still lived in their wooden cities and hollow hills and the faces in the trees kept watch so as cold and death filled the earth the last hero determined to seek out the children in the hopes that their ancient magics could win back what the armies of men had lost he set out into the dead lands with a sword a horse a dog and a dozen companions for years he searched until he despaired of ever finding the children of the forest in their secret cities one by one his friends died and his horse and finally even his dog and his sword froze so hard the blade snapped when he tried to use it and the others smelled the hot blood in him and came silent on his trail stalking him with packs of pale white spiders big as hounds the door opened with a bang and brans heart leapt up into his mouth in sudden fear but it was only maester luwin with hodor looming in the stairway behind him hodor the stableboy announced as was his custom smiling hugely at them all maester luwin was not smiling we have visitors he announced and your presence is required bran im listening to a story now bran complained stories wait my little lord and when you come back to them why there they are old nan said visitors are not so patient and ofttimes they bring stories of their own who is it bran asked maester luwin tyrion lannister and some men of the nights watch with word from your brother jon robb is meeting with them now hodor will you help bran down to the hall hodor hodor agreed happily he ducked to get his great shaggy head under the door hodor was nearly seven feet tall it was hard to believe that he was the same blood as old nan bran wondered if he would shrivel up as small as his greatgrandmother when he was old it did not seem likely even if hodor lived to be a thousand hodor lifted bran as easy as if he were a bale of hay and cradled him against his massive chest he always smelled faintly of horses but it was not a bad smell his arms were thick with muscle and matted with brown hair hodor he said again theon greyjoy had once commented that hodor did not know much but no one could doubt that he knew his name old nan had cackled like a hen when bran told her that and confessed that hodors real name was walder no one knew where hodor had come from she said but when he started saying it they started calling him by it it was the only word he had they left old nan in the tower room with her needles and her memories hodor hummed tunelessly as he carried bran down the steps and through the gallery with maester luwin following behind hurrying to keep up with the stableboys long strides page robb was seated in fathers high seat wearing ringmail and boiled leather and the stern face of robb the lord theon greyjoy and hallis mollen stood behind him a dozen guardsmen lined the grey stone walls beneath tall narrow windows in the center of the room the dwarf stood with his servants and four strangers in the black of the nights watch bran could sense the anger in the hall the moment that hodor carried him through the doors any man of the nights watch is welcome here at winterfell for as long as he wishes to stay robb was saying with the voice of robb the lord his sword was across his knees the steel bare for all the world to see even bran knew what it meant to greet a guest with an unsheathed sword any man of the nights watch the dwarf repeated but not me do i take your meaning boy robb stood and pointed at the little man with his sword i am the lord here while my mother and father are away lannister i am not your boy if you are a lord you might learn a lords courtesy the little man replied ignoring the sword point in his face your bastard brother has all your fathers graces it would seem jon bran gasped out from hodors arms the dwarf turned to look at him so it is true the boy lives i could scarce believe it you starks are hard to kill you lannisters had best remember that robb said lowering his sword hodor bring my brother here hodor hodor said and he trotted forward smiling and set bran in the high seat of the starks where the lords of winterfell had sat since the days when they called themselves the kings in the north the seat was cold stone polished smooth by countless bottoms the carved heads of direwolves snarled on the ends of its massive arms bran clasped them as he sat his useless legs dangling the great seat made him feel half a baby robb put a hand on his shoulder you said you had business with bran well here he is lannister bran was uncomfortably aware of tyrion lannisters eyes one was black and one was green and both were looking at him studying him weighing him i am told you were quite the climber bran the little man said at last tell me how is it you happened to fall that day i never bran insisted he never fell never never never the child does not remember anything of the fall or the climb that came before it said maester luwin gently curious said tyrion lannister my brother is not here to answer questions lannister robb said curtly do your business and be on your way page i have a gift for you the dwarf said to bran do you like to ride boy maester luwin came forward my lord the child has lost the use of his legs he cannot sit a horse nonsense said lannister with the right horse and the right saddle even a cripple can ride the word was a knife through brans heart he felt tears come unbidden to his eyes im not a cripple then i am not a dwarf the dwarf said with a twist of his mouth my father will rejoice to hear it greyjoy laughed what sort of horse and saddle are you suggesting maester luwin asked a smart horse lannister replied the boy cannot use his legs to command the animal so you must shape the horse to the rider teach it to respond to the reins to the voice i would begin with an unbroken yearling with no old training to be unlearned he drew a rolled paper from his belt give this to your saddler he will provide the rest maester luwin took the paper from the dwarfs hand curious as a small grey squirrel he unrolled it studied it i see you draw nicely my lord yes this ought to work i should have thought of this myself it came easier to me maester it is not terribly unlike my own saddles will i truly be able to ride bran asked he wanted to believe them but he was afraid perhaps it was just another lie the crow had promised him that he could fly you will the dwarf told him and i swear to you boy on horseback you will be as tall as any of them robb stark seemed puzzled is this some trap lannister whats bran to you why should you want to help him your brother jon asked it of me and i have a tender spot in my heart for cripples and bastards and broken things tyrion lannister placed a hand over his heart and grinned the door to the yard flew open sunlight came streaming across the hall as rickon burst in breathless the direwolves were with him the boy stopped by the door wideeyed but the wolves came on their eyes found lannister or perhaps they caught his scent summer began to growl first grey wind picked it up they padded toward the little man one from the right and one from the left the wolves do not like your smell lannister theon greyioy commented perhaps its time i took my leave tyrion said he took a step backward and shaggydog came out of the shadows behind him snarling lannister recoiled and summer lunged at him from the other side he reeled away unsteady on his feet and grey wind snapped at his arm teeth ripping at his sleeve and tearing loose a scrap of cloth page no bran shouted from the high seat as lannisters men reached for their steel summer here summer to me the direwolf heard the voice glanced at bran and again at lannister he crept backward away from the little man and settled down below brans dangling feet robb had been holding his breath he let it out with a sigh and called grey wind his direwolf moved to him swift and silent now there was only shaggydog rumbling at the small man his eyes burning like green fire rickon call him bran shouted to his baby brother and rickon remembered himself and screamed home shaggy home now the black wolf gave lannister one final snarl and bounded off to rickon who hugged him tightly around the neck tyrion lannister undid his scarf mopped at his brow and said in a flat voice how interesting are you well my lord asked one of his men his sword in hand he glanced nervously at the direwolves as he spoke my sleeve is torn and my breeches are unaccountably damp but nothing was harmed save my dignity even robb looked shaken the wolves i dont know why they did that no doubt they mistook me for dinner lannister bowed stiffly to bran i thank you for calling them off young ser i promise you they would have found me quite indigestible and now i will be leaving truly a moment my lord maester luwin said he moved to robb and they huddled close together whispering bran tried to hear what they were saying but their voices were too low robb stark finally sheathed his sword i i may have been hasty with you he said youve done bran a kindness and well robb composed himself with an effort the hospitality of winterfell is yours if you wish it lannister spare me your false courtesies boy you do not love me and you do not want me here i saw an inn outside your walls in the winter town ill find a bed there and both of us will sleep easier for a few coppers i may even find a comely wench to warm the sheets for me he spoke to one of the black brothers an old man with a twisted back and a tangled beard yoren we go south at daybreak you will find me on the road no doubt with that he made his exit struggling across the hall on his short legs past rickon and out the door his men followed the four of the nights watch remained robb turned to them uncertainly i have had rooms prepared and youll find no lack of hot water to wash off the dust of the road i hope you will honor us at table tonight he spoke the words so awkwardly that even bran took note it was a speech he had learned not words from the heart but the black brothers thanked him all the same summer followed them up the tower steps as hodor carried bran back to his bed old nan was asleep in her chair hodor said hodor gathered up his greatgrandmother and carried her off snoring softly while bran lay thinking robb had promised that he could feast with page the nights watch in the great hall summer he called the wolf bounded up on the bed bran hugged him so hard he could feel the hot breath on his cheek i can ride now he whispered to his friend we can go hunting in the woods soon wait and see after a time he slept in his dream he was climbing again pulling himself up an ancient windowless tower his fingers forcing themselves between blackened stones his feet scrabbling for purchase higher and higher he climbed through the clouds and into the night sky and still the tower rose before him when he paused to look down his head swam dizzily and he felt his fingers slipping bran cried out and clung for dear life the earth was a thousand miles beneath him and he could not fly he could not fly he waited until his heart had stopped pounding until he could breathe and he began to climb again there was no way to go but up far above him outlined against a vast pale moon he thought he could see the shapes of gargoyles his arms were sore and aching but he dared not rest he forced himself to climb faster the gargoyles watched him ascend their eyes glowed red as hot coals in a brazier perhaps once they had been lions but now they were twisted and grotesque bran could hear them whispering to each other in soft stone voices terrible to hear he must not listen he told himself he must not hear so long as he did not hear them he was safe but when the gargoyles pulled themselves loose from the stone and padded down the side of the tower to where bran clung he knew he was not safe after all i didnt hear he wept as they came closer and closer i didnt i didnt he woke gasping lost in darkness and saw a vast shadow looming over him i didnt hear he whispered trembling in fear but then the shadow said hodor and lit the candle by the bedside and bran sighed with relief hodor washed the sweat from him with a warm damp cloth and dressed him with deft and gentle hands when it was time he carried him down to the great hall where a long trestle table had been set up near the fire the lords seat at the head of the table had been left empty but robb sat to the right of it with bran across from him they ate suckling pig that night and pigeon pie and turnips soaking in butter and afterward the cook had promised honeycombs summer snatched table scraps from brans hand while grey wind and shaggydog fought over a bone in the corner winterfells dogs would not come near the hall now bran had found that strange at first but he was growing used to it yoren was senior among the black brothers so the steward had seated him between robb and maester luwin the old man had a sour smell as if he had not washed in a long time he ripped at the meat with his teeth cracked the ribs to suck out the marrow from the bones and shrugged at the mention of jon snow ser allisers bane he grunted and two of his companions shared a laugh that bran did not understand but when robb asked for news of their uncle benjen the black brothers grew ominously quiet what is it bran asked yoren wiped his fingers on his vest theres hard news mlords and a cruel way to pay you for your meat and mead but the man as asks the question must bear the answer starks gone one of the other men said the old bear sent him out to look for waymar royce and hes late returning my lord page too long yoren said most like hes dead my uncle is not dead robb stark said loudly anger in his tones he rose from the bench and laid his hand on the hilt of his sword do you hear me my uncle is not dead his voice rang against the stone walls and bran was suddenly afraid old soursmelling yoren looked up at robb unimpressed whatever you say mlord he said he sucked at a piece of meat between his teeth the youngest of the black brothers shifted uncomfortably in his seat theres not a man on the wall knows the haunted forest better than benjen stark hell find his way back well said yoren maybe he will and maybe he wont good men have gone into those woods before and never come out all bran could think of was old nans story of the others and the last hero hounded through the white woods by dead men and spiders big as hounds he was afraid for a moment until he remembered how that story ended the children will help him he blurted the children of the forest theon greyjoy sniggered and maester luwin said bran the children of the forest have been dead and gone for thousands of years all that is left of them are the faces in the trees down here might be thats true maester yoren said but up past the wall whos to say up there a man cant always tell whats alive and whats dead that night after the plates had been cleared robb carried bran up to bed himself grey wind led the way and summer came close behind his brother was strong for his age and bran was as light as a bundle of rags but the stairs were steep and dark and robb was breathing hard by the time they reached the top he put bran into bed covered him with blankets and blew out the candle for a time robb sat beside him in the dark bran wanted to talk to him but he did not know what to say well find a horse for you i promise robb whispered at last are they ever coming back bran asked him yes robb said with such hope in his voice that bran knew he was hearing his brother and not just robb the lord mother will be home soon maybe we can ride out to meet her when she comes wouldnt that surprise her to see you ahorse even in the dark room bran could feel his brothers smile and afterward well ride north to see the wall we wont even tell jon were coming well just be there one day you and me it will be an adventure an adventure bran repeated wistfully he heard his brother sob the room was so dark he could not see the tears on robbs face so he reached out and found his hand their fingers twined together eddard page lord arryns death was a great sadness for all of us my lord grand maester pycelle said i would be more than happy to tell you what i can of the manner of his passing do be seated would you care for refreshments some dates perhaps i have some very fine persimmons as well wine no longer agrees with my digestion i fear but i can offer you a cup of iced milk sweetened with honey i find it most refreshing in this heat there was no denying the heat ned could feel the silk tunic clinging to his chest thick moist air covered the city like a damp woolen blanket and the riverside had grown unruly as the poor fled their hot airless warrens to jostle for sleeping places near the water where the only breath of wind was to be found that would be most kind ned said seating himself pycelle lifted a tiny silver bell with thumb and forefinger and tinkled it gently a slender young serving girl hurried into the solar iced milk for the kings hand and myself if you would be so kind child well sweetened as the girl went to fetch their drinks the grand maester knotted his fingers together and rested his hands on his stomach the smallfolk say that the last year of summer is always the hottest it is not so yet ofttimes it feels that way does it not on days like this i envy you northerners your summer snows the heavy jeweled chain around the old mans neck chinked softly as he shifted in his seat to be sure king maekars summer was hotter than this one and near as long there were fools even in the citadel who took that to mean that the great summer had come at last the summer that never ends but in the seventh year it broke suddenly and we had a short autumn and a terrible long winter still the heat was fierce while it lasted oldtown steamed and sweltered by day and came alive only by night we would walk in the gardens by the river and argue about the gods i remember the smells of those nights my lordperfume and sweat melons ripe to bursting peaches and pomegranates nightshade and moonbloom i was a young man then still forging my chain the heat did not exhaust me as it does now pycelles eyes were so heavily lidded he looked halfasleep my pardons lord eddard you did not come to hear foolish meanderings of a summer forgotten before your father was born forgive an old man his wanderings if you would minds are like swords i do fear the old ones go to rust ah and here is our milk the serving girl placed the tray between them and pycelle gave her a smile sweet child he lifted a cup tasted nodded thank you you may go when the girl had taken her leave pycelle peered at ned through pale rheumy eyes now where were we oh yes you asked about lord arryn i did ned sipped politely at the iced milk it was pleasantly cold but oversweet to his taste if truth be told the hand had not seemed quite himself for some time pycelle said we had sat together on council many a year he and and the signs were there to read but i put them down to the great burdens he had borne so faithfully for so long those broad shoulders were weighed down by all the cares of the realm and more besides his son was ever sickly and his lady wife so anxious that she would scarcely let the boy out of her sight it was enough to weary even a strong man and the lord jon was not young small wonder if he seemed melancholy and tired or so i thought at the time yet now i am less certain he gave a ponderous shake of his head what can you tell me of his final illness page the grand maester spread his hands in a gesture of helpless sorrow he came to me one day asking after a certain book as hale and healthy as ever though it did seem to me that something was troubling him deeply the next morning he was twisted over in pain too sick to rise from bed maester colemon thought it was a chill on the stomach the weather had been hot and the hand often iced his wine which can upset the digestion when lord jon continued to weaken i went to him myself but the gods did not grant me the power to save him i have heard that you sent maester colemon away the grand maesters nod was as slow and deliberate as a glacier i did and i fear the lady lysa will never forgive me that maybe i was wrong but at the time i thought it best maester colemon is like a son to me and i yield to none in my esteem for his abilities but he is young and the young ofttimes do not comprehend the frailty of an older body he was purging lord arryn with wasting potions and pepper juice and i feared he might kill him did lord arryn say anything to you during his final hours pycelle wrinkled his brow in the last stage of his fever the hand called out the name robert several times but whether he was asking for his son or for the king i could not say lady lysa would not permit the boy to enter the sickroom for fear that he too might be taken ill the king did come and he sat beside the bed for hours talking and joking of times long past in hopes of raising lord jons spirits his love was fierce to see was there nothing else no final words when i saw that all hope had fled i gave the hand the milk of the poppy so he should not suffer just before he closed his eyes for the last time he whispered something to the king and his lady wife a blessing for his son the seed is strong he said at the end his speech was too slurred to comprehend death did not come until the next morning but lord jon was at peace after that he never spoke again ned took another swallow of milk trying not to gag on the sweetness of it did it seem to you that there was anything unnatural about lord arryns death unnatural the aged maesters voice was thin as a whisper no i could not say so sad for a certainty yet in its own way death is the most natural thing of all lord eddard jon arryn rests easy now his burdens lifted at last this illness that took him said ned had you ever seen its like before in other men near forty years i have been grand maester of the seven kingdoms pycelle replied under our good king robert and aerys targaryen before him and his father jaehaerys the second before him and even for a few short months under jaehaeryss father aegon the fortunate the fifth of his name i have seen more of illness than i care to remember my lord i will tell you this every case is different and every case is alike lord jons death was no stranger than any other george ra martin page his wife thought otherwise the grand maester nodded i recall now the widow is sister to your own noble wife if an old man may be forgiven his blunt speech let me say that grief can derange even the strongest and most disciplined of minds and the lady lysa was never that since her last stillbirth she has seen enemies in every shadow and the death of her lord husband left her shattered and lost so you are quite certain that jon arryn died of a sudden illness i am pycelle replied gravely if not illness my good lord what else could it be poison ned suggested quietly pycelles sleepy eyes flicked open the aged maester shifted uncomfortably in his seat a disturbing thought we are not the free cities where such things are common grand maester aethelmure wrote that all men carry murder in their hearts yet even so the poisoner is beneath contempt he fell silent for a moment his eyes lost in thought what you suggest is possible my lord yet i do not think it likely every hedge maester knows the common poisons and lord arryn displayed none of the signs and the hand was loved by all what sort of monster in mans flesh would dare to murder such a noble lord i have heard it said that poison is a womans weapon pycelle stroked his beard thoughtfully it is said women cravens and eunuchs he cleared his throat and spat a thick glob of phelm onto the rushes above them a raven cawed loudly in the rookery the lord varys was born a slave in lys did you know put not your trust in spiders my lord that was scarcely anything ned needed to be told there was something about varys that made his flesh crawl i will remember that maester and i thank you for your help i have taken enough of your time he stood grand maester pycelle pushed himself up from his chair slowly and escorted ned to the door i hope i have helped in some small way to put your mind at ease if there is any other service i might perform you need only ask one thing ned told him i should be curious to examine the book that you lent jon the day before he fell ill i fear you would find it of little interest pycelle said it was a ponderous tome by grand maester malleon on the lineages of the great houses still i should like to see it the old man opened the door as you wish i have it here some a gaml of thronls where when i find it i shall have it sent to your chambers straightaway you have been most courteous ned told him then almost as an afterthought he said one last question if you would be so kind you mentioned that the king was at lord arryns bedside when he died i wonder was the queen with him page why no pycelle said she and the children were making the journey to casterly rock in company with her father lord tywin had brought a retinue to the city for the tourney on prince joffreys name day no doubt hoping to see his son jaime win the champions crown in that he was sadly disappointed it fell to me to send the queen word of lord arryns sudden death never have i sent off a bird with a heavier heart dark wings dark words ned murmured it was a proverb old nan had taught him as a boy so the fishwives say grand maester pycelle agreed but we know it is not always so when maester luwins bird brought the word about your bran the message lifted every true heart in the castle did it not as you say maester the gods are merciful pycelle bowed his head come to me as often as you like lord eddard i am here to serve yes ned thought as the door swung shut but whom on the way back to his chambers he came upon his daughter arya on the winding steps of the tower of the hand windmilling her arms as she struggled to balance on one leg the rough stone had scuffed her bare feet ned stopped and looked at her arya what are you doing syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours her hands flailed at the air to steady herself ned had to smile which toe he teased any toe arya said exasperated with the question she hopped from her right leg to her left swaying dangerously before she regained her balance must you do your standing here he asked its a long hard fall down these steps syrio says a water dancer never falls she lowered her leg to stand on two feet father will bran come and live with us now not for a long time sweet one he told her he needs to win his strength back arya bit her lip what will bran do when hes of age ned knelt beside her he has years to find that answer arya for now it is enough to know that he will live the night the bird had come from winterfell eddard stark had taken the girls to the castle godswood an acre of elm and alder and black cottonwood overlooking the river the heart tree there was a great oak its ancient limbs overgrown with smokeberry vines they knelt before it to offer their thanksgiving as if it had been a weirwood sansa drifted to sleep as the moon rose arya several hours later curling up in the grass under neds cloak all through the dark hours he kept his vigil alone when dawn broke over the city the dark red blooms of dragons breath surrounded the girls where they lay i dreamed of bran sansa had whispered to him i saw him smiling page he was going to be a knight arya was saying now a knight of the kingsguard can he still be a knight no ned said he saw no use in lying to her yet someday he may be the lord of a great holdfast and sit on the kings council he might raise castles like brandon the builder or sail a ship across the sunset sea or enter your mothers faith and become the high septon but he will never run beside his wolf again he thought with a sadness too deep for words or lie with a woman or hold his own son in his arms arya cocked her head to one side can i be a kings councillor and build castles and become the high septon you ned said kissing her lightly on the brow will marry a king and rule his castle and your sons will be knights and princes and lords and yes perhaps even a high septon arya screwed up her face no she said thats sansa she folded up her right leg and resumed her balancing ned sighed and left her there inside his chambers he stripped off his sweatstained silks and sluiced cold water over his head from the basin beside the bed alyn entered as he was drying his face my lord he said lord baelish is without and begs audience escort him to my solar ned said reaching for a fresh tunic the lightest linen he could find ill see him at once littlefinger was perched on the window seat when ned entered watching the knights of the kingsguard practice at swords in the yard below if only old selmys mind were as nimble as his blade he said wistfully our council meetings would be a good deal livelier ser barristan is as valiant and honorable as any man in kings landing ned had come to have a deep respect for the aged whitehaired lord commander of the kingsguard and as tiresome littlefinger added though i daresay he should do well in the tourney last year he unhorsed the hound and it was only four years ago that he was champion the question of who might win the tourney interested eddard stark not in the least is there a reason for this visit lord petyr or are you here simply to enjoy the view from my window littlefinger smiled i promised cat i would help you in your inquiries and so i have that took ned aback promise or no promise he could not find it in him to trust lord petyr baelish who struck him as too clever by half you have something for me someone littlefinger corrected four someones if truth be told had you thought to question the hands servants page ned frowned would that i could lady arryn took her household back to the eyrie lysa had done him no favor in that regard all those who had stood closest to her husband had gone with her when she fled jons maester his steward the captain of his guard his knights and retainers most of her household littlefinger said not all a few remain a pregnant kitchen girl hastily wed to one of lord renlys grooms a stablehand who joined the city watch a potboy discharged from service for theft and lord arryns squire his squire ned was pleasantly surprised a mans squire often knew a great deal of his comings and goings ser hugh of the vale littlefinger named him the king knighted the boy after lord arryns death i shall send for him ned said and the others littlefinger winced my lord step over here to the window if you would be so kind why come and ill show you my lord frowning ned crossed to the window petyr baelish made a casual gesture there across the yard at the door of the armory do you see the boy squatting by the steps honing a sword with an oilstone what of him he reports to varys the spider has taken a great interest in you and all your doings he shifted in the window seat now glance at the wall farther west above the stables the guardsman leaning on the ramparts ned saw the man another of the eunuchs whisperers no this one belongs to the queen notice that he enjoys a fine view of the door to this tower the better to note who calls on you there are others many unknown even to me the red keep is full of eyes why do you think i hid cat in a brothel eddard stark had no taste for these intrigues seven hells he swore it did seem as though the man on the wahs was watching him suddenly uncomfortable ned moved away from the window is everyone someones informer in this cursed city scarcely said littlefinger he counted on the fingers on his hand why theres me you the king although come to think on it the king tells the queen much too much and im less than certain about you he stood up is there a man in your service that you trust utterly and completely yes said ned in that case i have a delightful palace in valyria that i would dearly love to sell you littlefinger said page with a mocking smile the wiser answer was no my lord but be that as it may send this paragon of yours to ser hugh and the others your own comings and goings will be noted but even varys the spider cannot watch every man in your service every hour of the day he started for the door lord petyr ned called after him i am grateful for your help perhaps i was wrong to distrust you littlefinger fingered his small pointed beard you are slow to learn lord eddard distrusting me was the wisest thing youve done since you climbed down off your horse jon jon was showing dareon how best to deliver a sidestroke when the new recruit entered the practice yard your feet should be farther apart he urged you dont want to lose your balance thats good now pivot as you deliver the stroke get all your weight behind the blade dareon broke off and lifted his visor seven gods he murmured would you look at this jon jon turned through the eye slit of his helm he beheld the fattest boy he had ever seen standing in the door of the armory by the look of him he must have weighed twenty stone the fur collar of his embroidered surcoat was lost beneath his chins pale eyes moved nervously in a great round moon of a face and plump sweaty fingers wiped themselves on the velvet of his doublet they they told me i was to come here for for training he said to no one in particular a lordling pyp observed to jon southron most like near highgarden pyp had traveled the seven kingdoms with a mummers troupe and bragged that he could tell what you were and where youd been born just from the sound of your voice a striding huntsman had been worked in scarlet thread upon the breast of the fat boys furtrimmed surcoat jon did not recognize the sigil ser alliser thorne looked over his new charge and said it would seem they have run short of poachers and thieves down south now they send us pigs to man the wall is fur and velvet your notion of armor my lord of ham it was soon revealed that the new recruit had brought his own armor with him padded doublet boiled leather mail and plate and helm even a great woodandleather shield blazoned with the same striding huntsman he wore on his surcoat as none of it was black however ser alliser insisted that he reequip himself from the armory that took half the morning his girth required donal noye to take apart a mail hauberk and refit it with leather panels at the sides to get a helm over his head the armorer had to detach the visor his leathers bound so tightly around his legs and under his arms that he could scarcely move dressed for battle the new boy looked like an overcooked sausage about to burst its skin let us hope you are not as inept as you look ser alliser said halder see what ser piggy can do jon snow winced halder had been born in a quarry and apprenticed as a stonemason he was sixteen tall and muscular and his blows were as hard as any jon had ever felt this will be uglier than a whores ass pyp muttered and it was page the fight lasted less than a minute before the fat boy was on the ground his whole body shaking as blood leaked through his shattered helm and between his pudgy fingers i yield he shrilled no more i yield dont hit me rast and some of the other boys were laughing even then ser alliser would not call an end on your feet ser piggy he called pick up your sword when the boy continued to cling to the ground thorne gestured to halder hit him with the flat of your blade until he finds his feet halder delivered a tentative smack to his foes upraised cheeks you can hit harder than that thorne taunted halder took hold of his longsword with both hands and brought it down so hard the blow split leather even on the flat the new boy screeched in pain jon snow took a step forward pyp laid a mailed hand on his arm jon no the small boy whispered with an anxious glance at ser alliser thorne on your feet thorne repeated the fat boy struggled to rise slipped and fell heavily again ser piggy is starting to grasp the notion ser alliser observed again halder lifted the sword for another blow cut us off a ham rast urged laughing jon shook off pyps hand halder enough halder looked to ser alliser the bastard speaks and the peasants tremble the masteratarms said in that sharp cold voice of his i remind you that i am the masteratarms here lord snow look at him haider jon urged ignoring thorne as best he could theres no honor in beating a fallen foe he yielded he knelt beside the fat boy haider lowered his sword he yielded he echoed ser allisers onyx eyes were fixed on jon snow it would seem our bastard is in love he said as jon helped the fat boy to his feet show me your steel lord snow jon drew his longsword he dared defy ser alliser only to a point and he feared he was well beyond it now thorne smiled the bastard wishes to defend his lady love so we shall make an exercise of it rat pimple help our stone head here rast and albett moved to join haider three of you ought to be sufficient to make lady piggy squeal all you need do is get past the bastard stay behind me jon said to the fat boy ser alliser had often sent two foes against him but never three he knew he would likely go to sleep bruised and bloody tonight he braced himself for the assault suddenly pyp was beside him three to two will make for better sport the small boy said cheerfully he dropped his visor and slid out his sword before jon could even think to protest grenn had stepped up to make a third the yard had grown deathly quiet jon could feel ser allisers eyes why are you waiting he asked page rast and the others in a voice gone deceptively soft but it was jon who moved first haider barely got his sword up in time jon drove him backward attacking with every blow keeping the older boy on the heels know your foe ser rodrik had taught him once jon knew haider brutally strong but short of patience with no taste for defense frustrate him and he would leave himself open as certain as sunset the clang of steel echoed through the yard as the others joined battle around him jon blocked a savage cut at his head the shock of impact running up his arm as the swords crashed together he slammed a sidestroke into haiders ribs and was rewarded with a muffled grunt of pain the counterstroke caught jon on the shoulder chainmail crunched and pain flared up his neck but for an instant haider was unbalanced jon cut his left leg from under him and he fell with a curse and a crash grenn was standing his ground as jon had taught him giving albett more than he cared for but pyp was hardpressed rast had two years george rr martin and forty pounds on him jon stepped up behind him and rang the rapers helm like a bell as rast went reeling pyp slid in under his guard knocked him down and leveled a blade at his throat by then jon had moved on facing two swords albett backed away i yield he shouted ser alliser thorne surveyed the scene with disgust the mummers farce has gone on long enough for today he walked away the session was at an end dareon helped halder to his feet the quarrymans son wrenched off his helm and threw it across the yard for an instant i thought i finally had you snow for an instant you did jon replied under his mail and leather his shoulder was throbbing he sheathed his sword and tried to remove his helm but when he raised his arm the pain made him grit his teeth let me a voice said thickfingered hands unfastened helm from gorget and lifted it off gently did he hurt you ive been bruised before he touched his shoulder and winced the yard was emptying around them blood matted the fat boys hair where halder had split his helm asunder my name is samwell tarly of horn he stopped and licked his lips i mean i was of horn hill until i left ive come to take the black my father is lord randyll a bannerman to the tyrells of highgarden i used to be his heir only his voice trailed off im jon snow ned starks bastard of winterfell samwell tarly nodded i page my mother calls me sam you can call him lord snow pyp said as he came up to join them you dont want to know what his mother calls him these two are grenn and pypar jon said grenns the ugly one pyp said grenn scowled youre uglier than me at least i dont have ears like a bat my thanks to all of you the fat boy said gravely why didnt you get up and fight grenn demanded i wanted to truly i just i couldnt i didnt want him to hit me anymore he looked at the ground i my lord father always said so grenn looked thunderstruck even pyp had no words to say to that and pyp had words for everything what sort of man would proclaim himself a coward samwell tarly must have read their thoughts on their faces his eyes if you want you can call me sam i fear im a coward met jons and darted away quick as frightened animals i im sorry he said i dont mean to to be like i am he walked heavily toward the armory jon called after him you were hurt he said tomorrow youll do better sam looked mournfully back over one shoulder no i wont he said blinking back tears i never do better when he was gone grenn frowned nobody likes cravens he said uncomfortably i wish we hadnt helped him what if they think were craven too youre too stupid to be craven pyp told him i am not grenn said yes you are if a bear attacked you in the woods youd be too stupid to run away i would not grenn insisted id run away faster than you he stopped suddenly scowling when he saw pyps grin and realized what hed just said his thick neck flushed a dark red jon left them there arguing as he returned to the armory hung up his sword and stripped off his battered armor page life at castle black followed certain patterns the mornings were for swordplay the afternoons for work the black brothers set new recruits to many different tasks to learn where their skills lay jon cherished the rare afternoons when he was sent out with ghost ranging at his side to bring back game for the lord commanders table but for every day spent hunting he gave a dozen to donal noye in the armory spinning the whetstone while the onearmed smith sharpened axes grown dull from use or pumping the bellows as noye hammered out a new sword other times he ran messages stood at guard mucked out stables fletched arrows assisted maester aemon with his birds or bowen marsh with his counts and inventories that afternoon the watch commander sent him to the winch cage with four barrels of freshcrushed stone to scatter gravel over the icy footpaths atop the wall it was lonely and boring work even with ghost along for company but jon found he did not mind on a clear day you could see half the world from the top of the wall and the air was always cold and bracing he could think here and he found himself thinking of samwell tarly and oddly of tyrion lannister he wondered what tyrion would have made of the fat boy most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it the dwarf had told him grinning the world was full of cravens who pretended to be heroes it took a queer sort of courage to admit to cowardice as samwell tarly had his sore shoulder made the work go slowly it was late afternoon before jon finished graveling the paths he lingered on high to watch the sun go down turning the western sky the color of blood finally as dusk was settling over the north jon rolled the empty barrels back into the cage and signaled the winch men to lower him the evening meal was almost done by the time he and ghost reached the common hall a group of the black brothers were dicing over mulled wine near the fire his friends were at the bench nearest the west wall laughing pyp was in the middle of a story the mummers boy with the big ears was a born liar with a hundred different voices and he did not tell his tales so much as live them playing all the parts as needed a king one moment and a swineherd the next when he turned into an alehouse girl or a virgin princess he used a high falsetto voice that reduced them all to tears of helpless laughter and his eunuchs were always eerily accurate caricatures of ser alliser jon took as much pleasure from pyps antics as anyone yet that night he turned away and went instead to the end of the bench where samwell tarly sat alone as far from the others as he could get he was finishing the last of the pork pie the cooks had served up for supper when jon sat down across from him the fat boys eyes widened at the sight of ghost is that a wolf a direwolf jon said his name is ghost the direwolf is the sigil of my fathers house ours is a striding huntsman samwell tarly said do you like to hunt the fat boy shuddered i hate it he looked as though he was going to cry again whats wrong now jon asked him why are you always so frightened sam stared at the last of his pork pie and gave a feeble shake of his head too scared even to talk a burst of laughter filled the hall jon heard pyp squeaking in a high voice he stood lets go outside page the round fat face looked up at him suspicious why what will we do outside talk jon said have you seen the wall im fat not blind samwell tarly said of course i saw it its seven hundred feet high yet he stood up all the same wrapped a furlined cloak over his shoulders and followed jon from the common hall still wary as if he suspected some cruel trick was waiting for him in the night ghost padded along beside them i never thought it would be like this sam said as they walked his words steaming in the a gaml of thronfs cold air already he was huffing and puffing as he tried to keep up all the buildings are falling down and its so so cold a hard frost was settling over the castle and jon could hear the soft crunch of grey weeds beneath his boots sam nodded miserably i hate the cold he said last night i woke up in the dark and the fire had gone out and i was certain i was going to freeze to death by morning it must have been warmer where you come from i never saw snow until last month we were crossing the barrowlands me and the men my father sent to see me north and this white stuff began to fall like a soft rain at first i thought it was so beautiful like feathers drifting from the sky but it kept on and on until i was frozen to the bone the men had crusts of snow in their beards and more on their shoulders and still it kept coming i was afraid it would never end jon smiled the wall loomed before them glimmering palely in the light of the half moon in the sky above the stars burned clear and sharp are they going to make me go up there sam asked his face curdled like old milk as he looked at the great wooden stairs ill die if i have to climb that theres a winch jon said pointing they can draw you up in a cage samwell tarly sniffled i dont like high places it was too much jon frowned incredulous are you afraid of everything he asked i dont understand if you are truly so craven why are you here why would a coward want to join the nights watch samwell tarly looked at him for a long moment and his round face seemed to cave in on itself he sat down on the frostcovered ground and began to cry huge choking sobs that made his whole body shake jon snow could only stand and watch like the snowfall on the barrowlands it seemed the tears would never end it was ghost who knew what to do silent as shadow the pale direwolf moved closer and began to lick the warm tears off samwell tarlys face the fat boy cried out startled and somehow in a heartbeat his sobs turned to laughter page jon snow laughed with him afterward they sat on the frozen ground huddled in their cloaks with ghost between them jon told the story of how he and robb had found the pups newborn in the late summer snows it seemed a thousand years ago now before long he found himself talking of winterfell sometimes i dream about it he said im walking down this long empty hall my voice echoes all around but no one answers so i walk faster opening doors shouting names i dont even know who im looking for most nights its my father but sometimes its robb instead or my little sister arya or my uncle the thought of benjen stark saddened him his uncle was still missing the old bear had sent out rangers in search of him ser jaremy rykker had led two sweeps and quorin halfhand had gone forth from the shadow tower but theyd found nothing aside from a few blazes in the trees that his uncle had left to mark his way in the stony highlands to the northwest the marks stopped abruptly and all trace of ben stark vanished do you ever find anyone in your dream sam asked jon shook his head no one the castle is always empty he had never told anyone of the dream and he did not understand why he was telling sam now yet somehow it felt good to talk of it even the ravens are gone from the rookery and the stables are full of bones that always scares me i start to run then throwing open doors climbing the tower three steps at a time screaming for someone for anyone and then i find myself in front of the door to the crypts its black inside and i can see the steps spiraling down somehow i know i have to go down there but i dont want to im afraid of what might be waiting for me the old kings of winter are down there sitting on their thrones with stone wolves at their feet and iron swords across their laps but its not them im afraid of i scream that im not a stark that this isnt my place but its no good i have to go anyway so i start down feeling the walls as i descend with no torch to light the way it gets darker and darker until i want to scream he stopped frowning embarrassed thats when i always wake his skin cold and clammy shivering in the darkness of his cell ghost would leap up beside him his warmth as comforting as daybreak he would go back to sleep with his face pressed into the direwolf s shaggy white fur do you dream of horn hill jon asked no sams mouth grew tight and hard i hated it there he scratched ghost behind the ear brooding and jon let the silence breathe after a long while samwell tarly began to talk and jon snow listened quietly and learned how it was that a selfconfessed coward found himself on the wall the tarlys were a family old in honor bannermen to mace tyrell lord of highgarden and warden of the south the eldest son of lord randyll tarly samwell was born heir to rich lands a strong keep and a storied twohanded greatsword named heartsbane forged of valyrian steel and passed down from father to son near five hundred years whatever pride his lord father might have felt at samwells birth vanished as the boy grew up plump soft and awkward sam loved to listen to music and make his own songs to wear soft velvets to play in the castle kitchen beside the cooks drinking in the rich smells as he snitched lemon cakes and blueberry tarts his passions were books and kittens and dancing clumsy as he was but he grew ill at the sight of blood and wept to see even a chicken slaughtered a dozen mastersatarms came and went at horn hill trying to turn samwell into the knight his father wanted the boy was cursed and caned slapped and starved one man had him sleep in his chainmail to make him more martial another dressed him in his page mothers clothing and paraded him through the bailey to shame him into valor he only grew fatter and more frightened until lord randylls disappointment turned to anger and then to loathing one time sam confided his voice dropping from a whisper two men came to the castle warlocks from qarth with white skin and blue lips they slaughtered a bull aurochs and made me bathe in the hot blood but it didnt make me brave as theyd promised i got sick and retched father had them scourged finally after three girls in as many years lady tarly gave her lord husband a second son from that day lord randyll ignored sam devoting all his time to the younger boy a fierce robust child more to his liking samwell had known several years of sweet peace with his music and his books until the dawn of his fifteenth name day when he had been awakened to find his horse saddled and ready three menatarms had escorted him into a wood near horn hill where his father was skinning a deer you are almost a man grown now and my heir lord randyll tarly had told his eldest son his long knife laying bare the carcass as he spoke you have given me no cause to disown you but neither will i allow you to inherit the land and title that should be dickons heartsbane must go to a man strong enough to wield her and you are not worthy to touch her hilt so i have decided that you shall this day announce that you wish to take the black you will forsake all claim to your brothers inheritance and start north before evenfall if you do not then on the morrow we shall have a hunt and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble and you will be thrown from the saddle to die or so i will tell your mother she has a womans heart and finds it in her to cherish even you and i have no wish to cause her pain please do not imagine that it will truly be that easy should you think to defy me nothing would please me more than to hunt you down like the pig you are his arms were red to the elbow as he laid the skinning knife aside so there is your choice the nights watchhe reached inside the deer ripped out its heart and held it in his fist red and drippingor this sam told the tale in a calm dead voice as if it were something that had happened to someone else not to him and strangely jon thought he did not weep not even once when he was done they sat together and listened to the wind for a time there was no other sound in all the world finally jon said we should go back to the common hall why sam asked jon shrugged theres hot cider to drink or mulled wine if you prefer some nights dareon sings for us if the mood is on him he was a singer before well not truly but almost an apprentice singer how did he come here sam asked lord rowan of goldengrove found him in bed with his daughter the girl was two years older and dareon swears she helped him through her window but under her fathers eye she named it rape so here he is when maester aemon heard him sing he said his voice was honey poured over thunder jon smiled toad sometimes sings too if you call it singing drinking songs he learned in his fathers winesink pyp says his voice is piss poured over a fart they laughed at that together i should like to hear them both sam admitted but they would not want me there his face was page troubled hes going to make me fight again on the morrow isnt he he is jon was forced to say sam got awkwardly to his feet i had better try to sleep he huddled down in his cloak and plodded off the others were still in the common room when jon returned alone but for ghost where haveyou been pyp asked talking with sam he said he truly is craven said grenn at supper there were still places on the bench when he got his pie but he was too scared to come sit with us the lord of ham thinks hes too good to eat with the likes of us suggested jeren i saw him eat a pork pie toad said smirking do you think it was a brother he began to make oinking noises stop it jon snapped angrily the other boys fell silent taken aback by his sudden fury listen to me jon said into the quiet and he told them how it was going to be pyp backed him as hed known he would but when halder spoke up it was a pleasant surprise grenn was anxious at the first but jon knew the words to move him one by one the rest fell in line jon persuaded some cajoled some shamed the others made threats where threats were required at the end they had all agreed all but rast you girls do as you please rast said but if thorne sends me against lady piggy im going to slice me off a rasher of bacon he laughed in jons face and left them there hours later as the castle slept three of them paid a call on his cell grenn held his arms while pyp sat on his legs jon could hear rasts rapid breathing as ghost leapt onto his chest the direwolfs eyes burned red as embers as his teeth nipped lightly at the soft skin of the boys throat just enough to draw blood remember we know where you sleep jon said softly the next morning jon heard rast tell albett and toad how his razor had slipped while he shaved from that day forth neither rast nor any of the others would hurt samwell tarly when ser alliser matched them against him they would stand their ground and swat aside his slow clumsy strokes if the masteratarms screamed for an attack they would dance in and tap sam lightly on breastplate or helm or leg ser alliser raged and threatened and called them all cravens and women and worse yet sam remained unhurt a few nights later at jons urging he joined them for the evening meal taking a place on the bench beside halder it was another fortnight before he found the nerve to join their talk but in time he was laughing at pyps faces and teasing grenn with the best of them fat and awkward and frightened he might be but samwell tarly was no fool one night he visited jon in page his cell i dont know what you did he said but i know you did it he looked away shyly ive never had a friend before were not friends jon said he put a hand on sams broad shoulder were brothers and so they were he thought to himself after sam had taken his leave robb and bran and rickon were his fathers sons and he loved them still yet jon knew that he had never truly been one of them catelyn stark had seen to that the grey walls of winterfell might still haunt his dreams but castle black was his life now and his brothers were sam and grenn and halder and pyp and the other castouts who wore the black of the nights watch my uncle spoke truly he whispered to ghost he wondered if he would ever see benjen stark again to tell him eddard its the hands tourney thats the cause of all the trouble my lords the commander of the city watch complained to the kings council the kings tourney ned corrected wincing i assure you the hand wants no part of it call it what you will my lord knights have been arriving from all over the realm and for every knight we get two freeriders three craftsmen six menatarms a dozen merchants two dozen whores and more thieves than i dare guess this cursed heat had half the city in a fever to start and now with all these visitors last night we had a drowning a tavern riot three knife fights a rape two fires robberies beyond count and a drunken horse race down the street of the sisters the night before a womans head was found in the great sept floating in the rainbow pool no one seems to know how it got there or who it belongs to how dreadful varys said with a shudder lord renly baratheon was less sympathetic if you cannot keep the kings peace janos perhaps the city watch should be commanded by someone who can stout jowly janos slynt puffed himself up like an angry frog his bald pate reddening aegon the dragon himself could not keep the peace lord renly i need more men how many ned asked leaning forward as ever robert had not troubled himself to attend the council session so it fell to his hand to speak for him as many as can be gotten lord hand hire fifty new men ned told him lord baelish will see that you get the coin i will littlefinger said you will you found forty thousand golden dragons for a champions purse surely you can scrape page together a few coppers to keep the kings peace ned turned back to janos slynt i will also give you twenty good swords from my own household guard to serve with the watch until the crowds have left all thanks lord hand slynt said bowing i promise you they shall be put to good use when the commander had taken his leave eddard stark turned to the rest of the council the sooner this folly is done with the better i shall like it as if the expense and trouble were not irksome enough all and sundry insisted on salting neds wound by calling it the hands tourney as if he were the cause of it and robert honestly seemed to think he should feel honored the realm prospers from such events my lord grand maester pycelle said they bring the great the chance of glory and the lowly a respite from their woes and put coins in many a pocket littlefinger added every inn in the city is full and the whores are walking bowlegged and jingling with each step lord renly laughed were fortunate my brother stannis is not with us remember the time he proposed to outlaw brothels the king asked him if perhaps hed like to outlaw eating shitting and breathing while he was at it if truth be told i ofttimes wonder how stannis ever got that ugly daughter of his he goes to his marriage bed like a man marching to a battlefield with a grim look in his eyes and a determination to do his duty ned had not joined the laughter i wonder about your brother stannis as well i wonder when he intends to end his visit to dragonstone and resume his seat on this council no doubt as soon as weve scourged all those whores into the sea littlefinger replied provoking more laughter i have heard quite enough about whores for one day ned said rising until the morrow harwin had the door when ned returned to the tower of the hand summon jory to my chambers and tell your father to saddle my horse ned told him too brusquely as you say my lord the red keep and the hands tourney were chafing him raw ned reflected as he climbed he yearned for the comfort of catelyns arms for the sounds of robb and jon crossing swords in the practice yard for the cool days and cold nights of the north in his chambers he stripped off his council silks and sat for a moment with the book while he waited for jory to arrive the lineages and histories of the great houses of the seven kingdoms with descliptions of many high lords and noble ladies and their children by grand maester malleon pycelle had spoken truly it made for ponderous reading yet jon arryn had asked for it and ned felt certain he had reasons there was something here some truth buried in these brittle yellow pages if only he could see it but what the tome was over a century old scarcely a man now alive had yet been born when malleon had compiled his dusty lists of weddings births and deaths he opened to the section on house lannister once more and turned the pages slowly hoping against page hope that something would leap out at him the lannisters were an old family tracing their descent back to lann the clever a trickster from the age of heroes who was no doubt as legendary as bran the builder though far more beloved of singers and taletellers in the songs lann was the fellow who winkled the casterlys out of casterly rock with no weapon but his wits and stole gold from the sun to brighten his curly hair ned wished he were here now to winkle the truth out of this damnable book a sharp rap on the door heralded jory cassel ned closed malleons tome and bid him enter ive promised the city watch twenty of my guard until the tourney is done he told him i rely on you to make the choice give alyn the command and make certain the men understand that they are needed to stop fights not start them rising ned opened a cedar chest and removed a light linen undertunic did you find the stableboy the watchman my lord jory said he vows hell never touch another horse what did he have to say he claims he knew lord arryn well fast friends they were jory snorted the hand always gave the lads a copper on their name days he says had a way with horses never rode his mounts too hard and brought them carrots and apples so they were always pleased to see him carrots and apples ned repeated it sounded as if this boy would be even less use than the others and he was the last of the four littlefinger had turned up jory had spoken to each of them in turn ser hugh had been brusque and uninformative and arrogant as only a newmade knight can be if the hand wished to talk to him he should be pleased to receive him but he would not be questioned by a mere captain of guards even if said captain was ten years older and a hundred times the swordsman the serving girl had at least been pleasant she said lord jon had been reading more than was good for him that he was troubled and melancholy over his young sons frailty and gruff with his lady wife the potboy now cordwainer had never exchanged so much as a word with lord jon but he was full of oddments of kitchen gossip the lord had been quarreling with the king the lord only picked at his food the lord was sending his boy to be fostered on dragonstone the lord had taken a great interest in the breeding of hunting hounds the lord had visited a master armorer to commission a new suit of plate wrought all in pale silver with a blue jasper falcon and a motherofpearl moon on the breast the kings own brother had gone with him to help choose the design the potboy said no not lord renly the other one lord stannis did our watchman recall anything else of note the lad swears lord jon was as strong as a man half his age often went riding with lord stannis he says stannis again ned thought he found that curious jon arryn and he had been cordial but never friendly and while robert had been riding north to winterfell stannis had removed himself to dragonstone the targaryen island fastness he had conquered in his brothers name he had given no word as to when he might return where did they go on these rides ned asked the boy says that they visited a brothel a brothel ned said the lord of the eyrie and hand of the king visited a brothel with stannis page baratheon he shook his head incredulous wondering what lord renly would make of this tidbit roberts lusts were the subject of ribald drinking songs throughout the realm but stannis was a different sort of man a bare year younger than the king yet utterly unlike him stern humorless unforgiving grim in his sense of duty the boy insists its true the hand took three guardsmen with him and the boy says they were joking of it when he took their horses afterward which brothel ned asked the boy did not know the guards would a pity lysa carried them off to the vale ned said dryly the gods are doing their best to vex us lady lysa maester colemon lord stannis everyone who might actually know the truth of what happened to jon arryn is a thousand leagues away will you summon lord stannis back from dragonstone not yet ned said not until i have a better notion of what this is all about and where he stands the matter nagged at him why did stannis leave had he played some part in jon arryns murder or was he afraid ned found it hard to imagine what could frighten stannis baratheon who had once held storms end through a year of siege surviving on rats and boot leather while the lords tyrell and redwyne sat outside with their hosts banqueting in sight of his walls bring me my doublet if you would the grey with the direwolf sigil i want this armorer to know who i am it might make him more forthcoming jory went to the wardrobe lord renly is brother to lord stannis as well as the king yet it seems that he was not invited on these rides ned was not sure what to make of renly with all his friendly ways and easy smiles a few days past he had taken ned aside to show him an exquisite rose gold locklet inside was a miniature painted in the vivid myrish style of a lovely young girl with does eyes and a cascade of soft brown hair renly had seemed anxious to know if the girl reminded him of anyone and when ned had no answer but a shrug he had seemed disappointed the maid was loras tyrells sister margaery hed confessed but there were those who said she looked like lyanna no ned had told him bemused could it be that lord renly who looked so like a young robert had conceived a passion for a girl he fancied to be a young lyanna that struck him as more than passing queer jory held out the doublet and ned slid his hands through the armholes perhaps lord stannis will return for roberts tourney he said as jory laced the garment up the back that would be a stroke of fortune my lord jory said ned buckled on a longsword in other words not bloody likely his smile was grim jory draped neds cloak across his shoulders and clasped it at the throat with the hands badge of office the armorer lives above his shop in a large house at the top of the street of steel alyn knows page the way my lord ned nodded the gods help this potboy if hes sent me off haring after shadows it was a slim enough staff to lean on but the jon arryn that ned stark had known was not one to wear jeweled and silvered plate steel was steel it was meant for protection not ornament he a gaml of thronls might have changed his views to be sure he would scarcely have been the first man who came to look on things differently after a few years at court but the change was marked enough to make ned wonder is there any other service i might perform i suppose youd best begin visiting whorehouses hard duty my lord jory grinned the men will be glad to help porther has made a fair start already neds favorite horse was saddled and waiting in the yard varly and jacks fell in beside him as he rode through the yard their steel caps and shirts of mail must have been sweltering yet they said no word of complaint as lord eddard passed beneath the kings gate into the stink of the city his grey and white cloak streaming from his shoulders he saw eyes everywhere and kicked his mount into a trot his guard followed he looked behind him frequently as they made their way through the crowded city streets tomard and desmond had left the castle early this morning to take up positions on the route they must take and watch for anyone following them but even so ned was uncertain the shadow of the kings spider and his little birds had him fretting like a maiden on her wedding night the street of steel began at the market square beside the river gate as it was named on maps or the mud gate as it was commonly called a mummer on stilts was striding through the throngs like some great insect with a horde of barefoot children trailing behind him hooting elsewhere two ragged boys no older than bran were dueling with sticks to the loud encouragement of some and the furious curses of others an old woman ended the contest by leaning out of her window and emptying a bucket of slops on the heads of the combatants in the shadow of the wall farmers stood beside their wagons bellowing out apples the best apples cheap at twice the price and blood melons sweet as honey and turnips onions roots here you go here here you go turnips onions roots here you go here the mud gate was open and a squad of city watchmen stood under the portcullis in their golden cloaks leaning on spears when a column of riders appeared from the west the guardsmen sprang into action shouting commands and moving the carts and foot traffic aside to let the knight enter with his escort the first rider through the gate carried a long black banner the silk rippled in the wind like a living thing across the fabric was blazoned a night sky slashed with purple lightning make way for lord beric the rider shouted make wayfor lord befic and close behind came the young lord himself a dashing i figure on a black courser with redgold hair and a black satin cloak dusted with stars here to fight in page the hands tourney my lord a guardsman called out to him here to win the hands tourney lord beric shouted back as the crowd cheered ned turned off the square where the street of steel began and followed its winding path up a long hill past blacksmiths working at open forges freeriders haggling over mail shirts and grizzled ironmongers selling old blades and razors from their wagons the farther they climbed the larger the buildings grew the man they wanted was all the way at the top of the hill in a huge house of timber and plaster whose upper stories loomed over the narrow street the double doors showed a hunting scene carved in ebony and weirwood a pair of stone knights stood sentry at the entrance armored in fanciful suits of polished red steel that transformed them into griffin and unicorn ned left his horse with jacks and shouldered his way inside the slim young serving girl took quick note of neds badge and the sigil on his doublet and the master came hurrying out all smiles and bows wine for the kings hand he told the girl gesturing ned to a couch i am tobho mott my lord please please put yourself at ease he wore a black velvet coat with hammers embroidered on the sleeves in silver thread around his neck was a heavy silver chain and a sapphire as large as a pigeons egg if you are in need of new arms for the hands tourney you have come to the right shop ned did not bother to correct him my work is costly and i make no apologies for that my lord he said as he filled two matching silver goblets you will not find craftsmanship equal to mine anywhere in the seven kingdoms i promise you visit every forge in kings landing if you like and compare for yourself any village smith can hammer out a shift of mail my work is art ned sipped his wine and let the man go on the knight of flowers bought all his armor here tobho boasted and many high lords the ones who knew fine steel and even lord renly the kings own brother perhaps the hand had seen lord renlys new armor the green plate with the golden antlers no other armorer in the city could get that deep a green he knew the secret of putting color in the steel itself paint and enamel were the crutches of a journeyman or mayhaps the hand wanted a blade tobho had learned to work valyrian steel at the forges of oohor as a boy only a man who knew the spells could take old weapons and forge them anew the direwolf was the sigil of house stark is it not i could fashion a direwolf helm so real that children will run from you in the street he vowed ned smiled did you make a falcon helm for lord arryn tobho mott paused a long moment and set aside his wine the hand did call upon me with lord stannis the kings brother i regret to say they did not honor me with their patronage ned looked at the man evenly saying nothing waiting he had found over the years that silence sometimes yielded more than questions and so it was this time they asked to see the boy the armorer said so i took them back to the forge the boy ned echoed he had no notion who the boy might be i should like to see the boy as well page tobho mott gave him a cool careful look as you wish my lord he said with no trace of his former friendliness he led ned out a rear door and across a narrow yard back to the cavernous stone barn where the work was done when the armorer opened the door the blast of hot air that came through made ned feel as though he were walking into a dragons mouth inside a forge blazed in each corner and the air stank of smoke and sulfur journeymen armorers glanced up from their hammers and tongs just long enough to wipe the sweat from their brows while barechested apprentice boys worked the bellows the master called over a tall lad about robbs age his arms and chest corded with muscle this is lord stark the new hand of the king he told him as the boy looked at ned through sullen blue eyes and pushed back sweatsoaked hair with his fingers thick hair shaggy and unkempt and black as ink the shadow of a new beard darkened his jaw this is gendry strong for his age and he works hard show the hand that helmet you made lad almost shyly the boy led them to his bench and a steel helm shaped like a bulls head with two great curving horns ned turned the helm over in his hands it was raw steel unpolished but expertly shaped this is fine work i would be pleased if you would let me buy it the boy snatched it out of his hands its not for sale tobho mott looked horrorstruck boy this is the kings hand if his lordship wants this helm make him a gift of it he honors you by asking i made it for me the boy said stubbornly a hundred pardons my lord his master said hurriedly to ned the boy is crude as new steel and like new steel would profit from some beating that helm is journeymans work at best forgive him and i promise i will craft you a helm like none you have ever seen hes done nothing that requires my forgiveness gendry when lord arryn came to see you what did you talk about he asked me questions is all mlord what sort of questions the boy shrugged how was and was i well treated and if i liked the work and stuff about my mother who she was and what she looked like and all what did you tell him ned asked the boy shoved a fresh fall of black hair off his forehead she died when i was little she had yellow hair and sometimes she used to sing to me i remember she worked in an alehouse did lord stannis question you as well the bald one no not him he never said no word just glared at me like i was some raper who done for his daughter page mind your filthy tongue the master said this is the kings own hand the boy lowered his eyes a smart boy but stubborn that helm the others call him bullheaded so he threw it in their teeth ned touched the boys head fingering the thick black hair look at me gendry the apprentice lifted his face ned studied the shape of his jaw the eyes like blue ice yes he thought i see it go back to your work lad im sorry to have bothered you he walked back to the house with the master who paid the boys apprentice fee he asked lightly mott looked fretful you saw the boy such a strong boy those hands of his those hands were made for hammers he had such promise i took him on without a fee the truth now ned urged the streets are full of strong boys the day you take on an apprentice without a fee will be the day the wall comes down who paid for him a lord the master said reluctantly he gave no name and wore no sigil on his coat he paid in gold twice the customary sum and said he was paying once for the boy and once for my silence describe him he was stout round of shoulder not so tall as you brown beard but there was a bit of red in it ill swear he wore a rich cloak that i do remember heavy purple velvet worked with silver threads but the hood shadowed his face and i never did see him clear he hesitated a moment my lord i want no trouble none of us wants trouble but i fear these are troubled times master mott ned said you know who the boy is i am only an armorer my lord i know what im told you know who the boy is ned repeated patiently that is not a question the boy is my apprentice the master said he looked ned in the eye stubborn as old iron who he was before he came to me thats none of my concern ned nodded he decided that he liked tobho mott master armorer if the day ever comes when gendry would rather wield a sword than forge one send him to me he has the look of a warrior until then you have my thanks master mott and my promise should i ever want a helm to frighten children this will be the first place i visit his guard was waiting outside with the horses did you find anything my lord jacks asked as ned mounted up i did ned told him wondering what had jon arryn wanted with a kings bastard and why was it worth his life catelyn page my lady you ought cover your head ser rodrik told her as their horses plodded north you will take a chill it is only water ser rodrik catelyn replied her hair hung wet and heavy a loose strand stuck to her forehead and she could imagine how ragged and wild she must look but for once she did not care the southern rain was soft and warm catelyn liked the feel of it on her face gentle as a mothers kisses it took her back to her childhood to long grey days at riverrun she remembered the godswood drooping branches heavy with moisture and the sound of her brothers laughter as he chased her through piles of damp leaves she remembered making mud pies with lysa the weight of them the mud slick and brown between her fingers they had served them to littlefinger giggling and hed eaten so much mud he was sick for a week how young they all had been catelyn had almost forgotten in the north the rain fell cold and hard and sometimes at night it turned to ice it was as likely to kill a crop as nurture it and it sent grown men running for the nearest shelter that was no rain for little girls to play in i am soaked through ser rodrik complained even my bones are wet the woods pressed close around them and the steady pattering of rain on leaves was accompanied by the small sucking sounds their horses made as their hooves pulled free of the mud we will want a fire tonight my lady and a hot meal would serve us both there is an inn at the crossroads up ahead catelyn told him she had slept many a night there in her youth traveling with her father lord hoster tully had been a restless man in his prime always riding somewhere she still remembered the innkeep a fat woman named masha heddle who chewed sourleaf night and day and seemed to have an endless supply of smiles and sweet cakes for the children the sweet cakes had been soaked with honey rich and heavy on the tongue but how catelyn had dreaded those smiles the sourleaf had stained mashas teeth a dark red and made her smile a bloody horror an inn ser rodrik repeated wistfully if only but we dare not risk it if we wish to remain unknown i think it best we seek out some small holdfast he broke off as they heard sounds up the road splashing water the clink of mail a horses whinny riders he warned his hand dropping to the hilt of his sword even on the kingsroad it never hurt to be wary they followed the sounds around a lazy bend of the road and saw them a column of armed men noisily fording a swollen stream catelyn reined up to let them pass the banner in the hand of the foremost rider hung sodden and limp but the guardsmen wore indigo cloaks and on their shoulders flew the silver eagle of seagard mallisters ser rodrik whispered to her as if she had not known my lady best pull up your hood catelyn made no move lord jason mallister himself rode with them surrounded by his knights his son patrek by his side and their squires close behind they were riding for kings landing and the hands tourney she knew for the past week the travelers had been thick as flies upon the kingsroad knights and freeriders singers with their harps and drums heavy wagons laden with hops or corn or casks of honey traders and craftsmen and whores and all of them moving south she studied lord jason boldly the last time she had seen him he had been jesting with her uncle at her wedding feast the mallisters stood bannermen to the tullys and his gifts had been lavish his brown hair page was salted with white now his face chiseled gaunt by time yet the years had not touched his pride he rode like a man who feared nothing catelyn envied him that she had come to fear so much as the riders passed lord jason nodded a curt greeting but it was only a high lords courtesy to strangers chance met on the road there was no recognition in those fierce eyes and his son did not even waste a look he did not know you ser rodrik said after wondering he saw a pair of mudspattered travelers by the side of the road wet and tired it would never occur to him to suspect that one of them was the daughter of his liege lord i think we shall be safe enough at the inn ser rodrik it was near dark when they reached it at the crossroads north of the great confluence of the trident masha heddle was fatter and greyer than catelyn remembered still chewing her sourleaf but she gave them only the most cursory of looks with nary a hint of her ghastly red smile two rooms at the top of the stair thats all there is she said chewing all the while theyre under the bell tower you wont be missing meals though theres some thinks it too noisy cant be helped were full up or near as makes no matter its those rooms or the road it was those rooms low dusty garrets at the top of a cramped narrow staircase leave your boots down here masha told them after shed taken their coin the boy will clean them i wont have you tracking mud up my stairs mind the bell those who come late to meals dont eat there were no smiles and no mention of sweet cakes when the supper bell rang the sound was deafening catelyn had changed into dry clothes she sat by the window watching rain run down the pane the glass was milky and full of bubbles and a wet dusk was falling outside catelyn could just make out the muddy crossing where the two great roads met the crossroads gave her pause if they turned west from here it was an easy ride down to riverrun her father had always given her wise counsel when she needed it most and she yearned to talk to him to warn him of the gathering storm if winterfell needed to brace for war how much more so riverrun so much closer to kings landing with the power of casterly rock looming to the west like a shadow if only her father had been stronger she might have chanced it but hoster tully had been bedridden these past two years and catelyn was loath to tax him now the eastern road was wilder and more dangerous climbing through rocky foothills and thick forests into the mountains of the moon past high passes and deep chasms to the vale of arryn and the stony fingers beyond above the vale the eyrie stood high and impregnable its towers reaching for the sky there she would find her sister and perhaps some of the answers ned sought surely lysa knew more than she had dared to put in her letter she might have the very proof that ned needed to bring the lannisters to ruin and if it came to war they would need the arryns and the eastern lords who owed them service yet the mountain road was perilous shadowcats prowled those passes rock slides were common and the mountain clans were lawless brigands descending from the heights to rob and kill and melting away like snow whenever the knights rode out from the vale in search of them even jon arryn as great a lord page as any the eyrie had ever known had always traveled in strength when he crossed the mountains catelyns only strength was one elderly knight armored in loyalty no she thought riverrun and the eyrie would have to wait her path ran north to winterfell where her sons and her duty were waiting for her as soon as they were safely past the neck she could declare herself to one of neds bannermen and send riders racing ahead with orders to mount a watch on the kingsroad the rain obscured the fields beyond the crossroads but catelyn saw the land clear enough in her memory the marketplace was just across the way and the village a mile farther on half a hundred white cottages surrounding a small stone sept there would be more now the summer had been long and peaceful north of here the kingsroad ran along the green fork of the trident through fertile valleys and green woodlands past thriving towns and stout holdfasts and the castles of the river lords catelyn knew them all the blackwoods and the brackens ever enemies whose quarrels her father was obliged to settle lady whent last of her line who dwelt with her ghosts in the cavernous vaults of harrenhal irascible lord frey who had outlived seven wives and filled his twin castles with children grandchildren and greatgrandchildren and bastards and grandbastards as well all of them were bannermen to the tullys their swords sworn to the service of riverrun catelyn wondered if that would be enough if it came to war her father was the staunchest man whod ever lived and she had no doubt that he would call his banners but would the banners come the darrys and rygers and mootons had sworn oaths to riverrun as well yet they had fought with rhaegar targaryen on the trident while lord frey had arrived with his levies well after the battle was over leaving some doubt as to which army he had planned to join theirs he had assured the victors solemnly in the aftermath but ever after her father had called him the late lord frey it must not come to war catelyn thought fervently they must not let it ser rodrik came for her just as the bell ceased its clangor we had best make haste if we hope to eat tonight my lady it might be safer if we were not knight and lady until we pass the neck she told him common travelers attract less notice a father and daughter taken to the road on some family business say as you say my lady ser rodrik agreed it was only when she laughed that he realized what hed done the old courtesies die hard mymy daughter he tried to tug on his missing whiskers and sighed with exasperation catelyn took his arm come father she said youll find that masha heddle sets a good table i think but try not to praise her you truly dont want to see her smile the common room was long and drafty with a row of huge wooden kegs at one end and a fireplace at the other a serving boy ran back and forth with skewers of meat while masha drew beer from the kegs chewing her sourleaf all the while the benches were crowded townsfolk and farmers mingling freely with all manner of travelers the crossroads made for odd companions dyers with black and purple hands shared a bench with rivermen reeking of fish an ironsmith thick with muscle squeezed in beside a wizened old septon hardbitten page sellswords and soft plump merchants swapped news like boon companions the company included more swords than catelyn would have liked three by the fire wore the red stallion badge of the brackens and there was a large party in blue steel ringmail and capes of a silvery grey on their shoulder was another familiar sigil the twin towers of house frey she studied their faces but they were all too young to have known her the senior among them would have been no older than bran when she went north ser rodrik found them an empty place on the bench near the kitchen across the table a handsome youth was fingering a woodharp seven blessings to you goodfolk he said as they sat an empty wine cup stood on the table before him and to you singer catelyn returned ser rodrik called for bread and meat and beer in a tone that meant now the singer a youth of some eighteen years eyed them boldly and asked where they were going and from whence they had come and what news they had letting the questions fly as quick as arrows and never pausing for an answer we left kings landing a fortnight ago catelyn replied answering the safest of his questions thats where im bound the youth said as she had suspected he was more interested in telling his own story than in hearing theirs singers loved nothing half so well as the sound of their own voices the hands tourney means rich lords with fat purses the last time i came away with more silver than i could carry or would have if i hadnt lost it all betting on the kingslayer to win the day the gods frown on the gambler ser rodrik said sternly he was of the north and shared the stark views on tournaments they frowned on me for certain the singer said your cruel gods and the knight of flowers altogether did me in no doubt that was a lesson for you ser rodrik said it was this time my coin will champion ser loras ser rodrik tried to tug at whiskers that were not there but before he could frame a rebuke the serving boy came scurrying up he laid trenchers of bread before them and filled them with chunks of browned meat off a skewer dripping with hot juice another skewer held tiny onions fire peppers and fat mushrooms ser rodrik set to lustily as the lad ran back to fetch them beer my name is marillion the singer said plucking a string on his woodharp doubtless youve heard me play somewhere his manner made catelyn smile few wandering singers ever ventured as far north as winterfell but she knew his like from her girlhood in riverrun i fear not she told him he drew a plaintive chord from the woodharp that is your loss he said who was the finest singer youve ever heard page alia of braavos ser rodrik answered at once oh im much better than that old stick marillion said if you have the silver for a song ill gladly show you i might have a copper or two but id sooner toss it down a well than pay for your howling ser rodrik groused his opinion of singers was well known music was a lovely thing for girls but he could not comprehend why any healthy boy would fill his hand with a harp when he might have had a sword your grandfather has a sour nature marillion said to catelyn i meant to do you honor an homage to your beauty in truth i was made to sing for kings and high lords oh i can see that catelyn said lord tully is fond of song i hear no doubt youve been to riverrun a hundred times the singer said airily they keep a chamber for me and the young lord is like a brother catelyn smiled wondering what edmure would think of that another singer had once bedded a girl her brother fancied he had hated the breed ever since and winterfell she asked him have you traveled north why would it marillion asked its all blizzards and bearskins up there and the starks know no music but the howling of wolves distantly she was aware of the door banging open at the far end of the room innkeep a servants voice called out behind her we have horses that want stabling and my lord of lannister requires a room and a hot bath oh gods ser rodrik said before catelyn reached out to silence him her fingers tightening hard around his forearm masha heddle was bowing and smiling her hideous red smile im sorry mlord truly were full up every room there were four of them catelyn saw an old man in the black of the nights watch two servants and him standing there small and bold as life my men will steep in your stable and as for myself well i do not require a large room as you can plainly see he flashed a mocking grin so long as the fires warm and the straw reasonably free of fleas i am a happy man masha heddle was beside herself mlord theres nothing its the tourney theres no help for it oh tyrion lannister pulled a coin from his purse and flicked it up over his head caught it tossed it again even across the room where catelyn sat the wink of gold was unmistakable a freerider in a faded blue cloak lurched to his feet youre welcome to my room mlord now theres a clever man lannister said as he sent the coin spinning across the room the freerider page snatched it from the air and a nimble one to boot the dwarf turned back to masha heddle you will be able to manage food i trust anything you like mord anything at all the innkeep promised and may he choke on it catelyn thought but it was bran she saw choking drowning on his own blood lannister glanced at the nearest tables my men will have whatever youre serving these people double portions weve had a long hard ride ill take a roast fowlchicken duck pigeon it makes no matter and send up a flagon of your best wine yoren will you sup with me aye mord i will the black brother replied the dwarf had not so much as glanced toward the far end of the room and catelyn was thinking how grateful she was for the crowded benches between them when suddenly marillion bounded to his feet my lord of lannister he called out i would be pleased to entertain you while you eat let me sing you the lay of your fathers great victory at kings landing nothing would be more likely to ruin my supper the dwarf said dryly his mismatched eyes considered the singer briefly started to move away and found catelyn he looked at her for a moment puzzled she turned her face away but too late the dwarf was smiling lady stark what an unexpected pleasure he said i was sorry to miss you at winterfell marillion gaped at her confusion giving way to chagrin as catelyn rose slowly to her feet she heatd set rodrik curse if only the man had lingered at the wall she thought if only lady stark masha heddle said thickly i was still catelyn tully the last time i bedded here she told the innkeep she could hear the muttering feel the eyes upon her catelyn glanced around the room at the faces of the knights and sworn swords and took a deep breath to slow the frantic beating of her heart did she dare take the risk there was no time to think it through only the moment and the sound of her own voice ringing in her ears you in the corner she said to an older man she had not noticed until now is that the black bat of harrenhal i see embroidered on your surcoat ser the man got to his feet it is my lady and is lady whent a true and honest friend to my father lord hoster tully of riverrun she is the man replied stoutly ser rodrik rose quietly and loosened his sword in its scabbard the dwarf was blinking at them blankfaced with puzzlement in his mismatched eyes the red stallion was ever a welcome sight in riverrun she said to the trio by the fire my father counts jonos bracken among his oldest and most loyal bannermen the three menatarms exchanged uncertain looks our lord is honored by his trust one of them said hesitantly page i envy your father all these fine friends lannister quipped but i do not quite see the purpose of this lady stark she ignored him turning to the large party in blue and grey they were the heart of the matter there were more than twenty of them i know your sigil as well the twin towers of frey how fares your good lord sers their captain rose lord walder is well my lady he plans to take a new wife on his ninetieth name day and has asked your lord father to honor the wedding with his presence tyrion lannister sniggered that was when catelyn knew he was hers this man came a guest into my house and there conspired to murder my son a boy of seven she proclaimed to the room at large i pointing ser rodrik moved to her side his sword in hand in the name of king robert and the good lords you serve i call upon you to seize him and help me return him to winterfell to await the kings justice she did not know what was more satisfying the sound of a dozen swords drawn as one or the look on tyrion lannisters face sansa sansa rode to the hands tourney with septa mordane and jeyne poole in a litter with curtains of yellow silk so fine she could see right through them they turned the whole world gold beyond the city walls a hundred pavilions had been raised beside the river and the common folk came out in the thousands to watch the games the splendor of it all took sansas breath away the shining armor the great chargers caparisoned in silver and gold the shouts of the crowd the banners snapping in the wind and the knights themselves the knights most of all it is better than the songs she whispered when they found the places that her father had promised her among the high lords and ladies sansa was dressed beautifully that day in a green gown that brought out the auburn of her hair and she knew they were looking at her and smiling they watched the heroes of a hundred songs ride forth each more fabulous than the last the seven knights of the kingsguard took the field all but jaime lannister in scaled armor the color of milk their cloaks as white as freshfallen snow ser jaime wore the white cloak as well but beneath it he was shining gold from head to foot with a lionshead helm and a golden sword ser gregor clegane the mountain that rides thundered past them like an avalanche sansa remembered lord yohn royce who had guested at winterfell two years glorgl rr martin before his armor is bronze thousands and thousands of years old engraved with magic runes that ward him against harm she whispered to jeyne septa mordane pointed out lord jason mallister in page indigo chased with silver the wings of an eagle on his helm he had cut down three of rhaegars bannermen on the trident the girls giggled over the warrior priest thoros of myr with his flapping red robes and shaven head until the septa told them that he had once scaled the walls of pyke with a flaming sword in hand other riders sansa did not know hedge knights from the fingers and highgarden and the mountains of dorne unsung freeriders and newmade squires the younger sons of high lords and the heirs of lesser houses younger men most had done no great deeds as yet but sansa and jeyne agreed that one day the seven kingdoms would resound to the sound of their names ser balon swann lord bryce caron of the marches bronze yohns heir ser andar royce and his younger brother ser robar their silvered steel plate filigreed in bronze with the same ancient runes that warded their father the twins ser horas and ser hobber whose shields displayed the grape cluster sigil of the redwynes burgundy on blue patrek mallister lord jasons son six freys of the crossing ser jared ser hosteen ser danwell ser emmon ser theo ser perwyn sons and grandsons of old lord walder frey and his bastard son martyn rivers as well jeyne poole confessed herself frightened by the look of jalabhar xho an exile prince from the summer isles who wore a cape of green and scarlet feathers over skin as dark as night but when she saw young lord beric dondarrion with his hair like red gold and his black shield slashed by lightning she pronounced herself willing to marry him on the instant the hound entered the lists as well and so too the kings brother handsome lord renly of storms end jory alyn and harwin rode for winterfell and the north jory looks a beggar among these others septa mordane sniffed when he appeared sansa could only agree jorys armor was bluegrey plate without device or ornament and a thin grey cloak hung from his shoulders like a soiled rag yet he acquitted himself well unhorsing horas redwyne in his first joust and one of the freys in his second in his third match he rode three passes at a freerider named lothor brune whose armor was as drab as his own neither man lost his seat but brunes lance was steadier and his blows better placed and the king gave him the victory alyn and harwin fared less well harwin was unhorsed in his first tilt by ser meryn of the kingsguard while alyn fell to ser balon swann the jousting went all day and into the dusk the hooves of the great warhorses pounding down the lists until the field was a ragged wasteland of torn earth a dozen times jeyne and sansa cried out in unison as riders crashed together lances exploding into splinters while the commons screamed for their favorites jeyne covered her eyes whenever a man fell like a frightened little girl but sansa was made of sterner stuff a great lady knew how to behave at tournaments even septa mordane noted her composure and nodded in approval the kingslayer rode brilliantly he overthrew ser andar royce and the marcher lord bryce caron as easily as if he were riding at rings and then took a hardfought match from whitehaired barristan selmy who had won his first two tilts against men thirty and forty years his junior sandor clegane and his immense brother ser gregor the mountain seemed unstoppable as well riding down one foe after the next in ferocious style the most terrifying moment of the day came during ser gregors second joust when his lance rode up and struck a young knight from the vale under the gorget with such force that it drove through his throat killing him instantly the youth fell not ten feet from where sansa was seated the point of ser gregors lance had snapped off in his neck and his lifes blood flowed out in slow pulses each weaker than the one before his armor was shiny new a bright streak of page fire ran down his outstretched arm as the steel caught the light then the sun went behind a cloud and it was gone his cloak was blue the color of the sky on a clear summers day trimmed with a border of crescent moons but as his blood seeped into it the cloth darkened and the moons turned red one by one jeyne poole wept so hysterically that septa mordane finally took her off to regain her composure but sansa sat with her hands folded in her lap watching with a strange fascination she had never seen a man die before she ought to be crying too she thought but the tears would not come perhaps she had used up all her tears for lady and bran it would be different if it had been jory or ser rodrik or father she told herself the young knight in the blue cloak was nothing to her some stranger from the vale of arryn whose name she had forgotten as soon as she heard it and now the world would forget his name too sansa realized there would be no songs sung for him that was sad after they carried off the body a boy with a spade ran onto the field and shoveled dirt over the spot where he had fallen to cover up the blood then the jousts resumed ser balon swann also fell to gregor and lord renly to the hound renly was unhorsed so violently that he seemed to fly backward off his charger legs in the air his head hit the ground with an audible crack that made the crowd gasp but it was just the golden antler on his helm one of the tines had snapped off beneath him when lord renly climbed to his feet the commons cheered wildly for king roberts handsome young brother was a great favorite he handed the broken tine to his conqueror with a gracious bow the hound snorted and tossed the broken antler into the crowd where the commons began to punch and claw over the little bit of gold until lord renly walked out among them and restored the peace by then septa mordane had returned alone jeyne had been feeling ill she explained she had helped her back to the castle sansa had almost forgotten about jeyne later a hedge knight in a checkered cloak disgraced himself by killing beric dondarrions horse and was declared forfeit lord beric shifted his saddle to a new mount only to be knocked right off it by thoros of myr ser aron santagar and lothor brune tilted thrice without result ser aron fell afterward to lord jason mallister and brune to yohn royces younger son robar in the end it came down to four the hound and his monstrous brother gregor jaime lannister the kingslayer and ser loras tyrell the youth they called the knight of flowers ser loras was the youngest son of mace tyrell the lord of highgarden and warden of the south at sixteen he was the youngest rider on the field yet he had unhorsed three knights of the kingsguard that morning in his first three jousts sansa had never seen anyone so beautiful his plate was intricately fashioned and enameled as a bouquet of a thousand different flowers and his snowwhite stallion was draped in a blanket of red and white roses after each victory ser loras would remove his helm and ride slowly round the fence and finally pluck a single white rose from the blanket and toss it to some fair maiden in the crowd his last match of the day was against the younger royce ser robars ancestral runes proved small protection as ser loras split his shield and drove him from his saddle to crash with an awful clangor in the dirt robar lay moaning as the victor made his circuit of the field finally they called for a litter and carried him off to his tent dazed and unmoving sansa never saw it her eyes were only for ser loras when the white horse stopped in front of her she thought her heart would burst page to the other maidens he had given white roses but the one he plucked for her was red sweet lady he said no victory is half so beautiful as you sansa took the flower timidly struck dumb by his gallantry his hair was a mass of lazy brown curls his eyes like liquid gold she inhaled the sweet fragrance of the rose and sat clutching it long after ser loras had ridden off when sansa finally looked up a man was standing over her staring he was short with a pointed beard and a silver streak in his hair almost as old as her father you must be one of her daughters he said to her he had greygreen eyes that did not smile when his mouth did you have the tully look im sansa stark she said ill at ease the man wore a heavy cloak with a fur collar fastened with a silver mockingbird and he had the effortless manner of a high lord but she did not know him i have not had the honor my lord septa mordane quickly took a hand sweet child this is lord petyr baelish of the kings small council your mother was my queen of beauty once the man said quietly his breath smelled of mint you have her hair his fingers brushed against her cheek as he stroked one auburn lock quite abruptly he turned and walked away by then the moon was well up and the crowd was tired so the king decreed that the last three matches would be fought the next morning before the melee while the commons began their walk home talking of the days jousts and the matches to come on the morrow the court moved to the riverside to begin the feast six monstrous huge aurochs had been roasting for hours turning slowly on wooden spits while kitchen boys basted them with butter and herbs until the meat crackled and spit tables and benches had been raised outside the pavilions piled high with sweetgrass and strawberries and freshbaked bread sansa and septa mordane were given places of high honor to the left of the raised dais where the king himself sat beside his queen when prince joffrey seated himself to her right she felt her throat tighten he had not spoken a word to her since the awful thing had happened and she had not dared to speak to him at first she thought she hated him for what theyd done to lady but after sansa had wept her eyes dry she told herself that it had not been joffreys doing not truly the queen had done it she was the one to hate her and arya nothing bad would have happened except for arya she could not hate joffrey tonight he was too beautiful to hate he wore a deep blue doublet studded with a double row of golden lions heads and around his brow a slim coronet made of gold and sapphires his hair was as bright as the metal sansa looked at him and trembled afraid that he might ignore her or worse turn hateful again and send her weeping from the table instead joffrey smiled and kissed her hand handsome and gallant as any prince in the songs and said ser loras has a keen eye for beauty sweet lady he was too kind she demurred trying to remain modest and calm though her heart was singing ser loras is a true knight do you think he will win tomorrow my lord page no jofftey said my dog will do for him or perhaps my uncle jaime and in a few years when i am old enough to enter the lists i shall do for them all he raised his hand to summon a servant with a flagon of iced surnmerwine and poured her a cup she looked anxiously at septa mordane until jofftey leaned over and filled the septas cup as well so she nodded and thanked him graciously and said not another word the servants kept the cups filled all night yet afterward sansa could not recall ever tasting the wine she needed no wine she was drunk on the magic of the night giddy with glamour swept away by beauties she had dreamt of all her life and never dared hope to know singers sat before the kings pavilion filling the dusk with music a juggler kept a cascade of burning clubs spinning through the air the kings own fool the piefaced simpleton called moon boy danced about on stilts all in motley making mock of everyone with such deft cruelty that sansa wondered if he was simple after all even septa mordane was helpless before him when he sang his little song about the high septon she laughed so hard she spilled wine on herself and joffrey was the soul of courtesy he talked to sansa all night showering her with compliments making her laugh sharing little bits of court gossip explaining moon boys japes sansa was so captivated that she quite forgot all her courtesies and ignored septa mordane seated to her left all the while the courses came and went a thick soup of barley and venison salads of sweetgrass and spinach and plums sprinkled with crushed nuts snails in honey and garlic sansa had never eaten snails before jofftey showed her how to get the snail out of the shell and fed her the first sweet morsel himself then came trout fresh from the river baked in clay her prince helped her crack open the hard casing to expose the flaky white flesh within and when the meat course was brought out he served her himself slicing a queens portion from the joint smiling as he laid it on her plate she could see from the way he moved that his right arm was still troubling him yet he uttered not a word of complaint later came sweetbreads and pigeon pie and baked apples fragrant with cinnamon and lemon cakes frosted in sugar but by then sansa was so stuffed that she could not manage more than two little lemon cakes as much as she loved them she was wondering whether she might attempt a third when the king began to shout king robert had grown louder with each course from time to time sansa could hear him laughing or roaring a command over the music and the clangor of plates and cutlery but they were too far away for her to make out his words now everybody heard him no he thundered in a voice that drowned out all other speech sansa was shocked to see the king on his feet red of face reeling he had a goblet of wine in one hand and he was drunk as a man could be you do not tell me what to do woman he screamed at queen cersei i am king here do you understand i rule here and if i say that i will fight tomorrow i will fight everyone was staring sansa saw ser barristan and the kings brother renly and the short man who had talked to her so oddly and touched her hair but no one made a move to interfere the queens face was a mask so bloodless that it might have been sculpted from snow she rose from the table gathered her skirts around her and stormed off in silence servants trailing behind jaime lannister put a hand on the kings shoulder but the king shoved him away hard lannister page stumbled and fell the king guffawed the great knight i can still knock you in the dirt remember that kingslayer he slapped his chest with the jeweled goblet splashing wine all over his satin tunic give me my hammer and not a man in the realm can stand before me jaime lannister rose and brushed himself off as you say your grace his voice was stiff lord renly came forward smiling youve spilled your wine robert let me bring you a fresh goblet sansa started as joffrey laid his hand on her arm it grows late the prince said he had a queer look on his face as if he were not seeing her at all do you need an escort back to the castle no sansa began she looked for septa mordane and was startled to find her with her head on the table snoring soft and ladylike snores i mean to say yes thank you that would be most kind i am tired and the way is so dark i should be glad for some protection joffrey called out dog sandor clegane seemed to take form out of the night so quickly did he appear he had exchanged his armor for a red woolen tunic with a leather dogs head sewn on the front the light of the torches made his burned face shine a dull red yes your grace he said take my betrothed back to the castle and see that no harm befalls her the prince told him brusquely and without even a word of farewell joffrey strode off leaving her there sansa could feel the hound watching her did you think joff was going to take you himself he laughed he had a laugh like the snarling of dogs in a pit small chance of that he pulled her unresisting to her feet come youre not the only one needs sleep ive drunk too much and i may need to kill my brother tomorrow he laughed again suddenly terrified sansa pushed at septa mordanes shoulder hoping to wake her but she only snored the louder king robert had stumbled off and half the benches were suddenly empty the feast was over and the beautiful dream had ended with it the hound snatched up a torch to light their way sansa followed close beside him the ground was rocky and uneven the flickering light made it seem to shift and move beneath her she kept her eyes lowered watching where she placed her feet they walked among the pavilions each with its banner and its armor hung outside the silence weighing heavier with every step sansa could not bear the sight of him he frightened her so yet she had been raised in all the ways of courtesy a true lady would not notice his face she told herself you rode gallantly today ser sandor she made herself say sandor clegane snarled at her spare me your empty little compliments girl and your sers i am no knight i spit on them and their vows my brother is a knight did you see him ride today yes sansa whispered trembling he was gallant the hound finished page he was mocking her she realized no one could withstand him she managed at last proud of herself it was no lie sandor clegane stopped suddenly in the middle of a dark and empty field she had no choice but to stop beside him some septa trained you well youre like one of those birds from the summer isles arent you a pretty little talking bird repeating all the pretty little words they taught you to recite thats unkind sansa could feel her heart fluttering in her chest youre frightening me i want to go now no one could withstand him the hound rasped thats truth enough no one could ever withstand gregor that boy today his second joust oh that was a pretty bit of business you saw that did you fool boy he had no business riding in this company no money no squire no one to help him with that armor that gorget wasnt fastened proper you think gregor didnt notice that you think ser gregors lance rode up by chance do you pretty little talking girl you believe that youre emptyheaded as a bird for true gregors lance goes where gregor wants it to go look at me look at me sandor clegane put a huge hand under her chin and forced her face up he squatted in front of her and moved the torch close theres a pretty for you take a good long stare you know you want to ive watched you turning away all the way down the kingsroad piss on that take your look his fingers held her jaw as hard as an iron trap his eyes watched hers drunken eyes sullen with anger she had to look the right side of his face was gaunt with sharp cheekbones and a grey eye beneath a heavy brow his nose was large and hooked his hair thin dark he wore it long and brushed it sideways because no hair grew on the other side of that face the left side of his face was a ruin his ear had been burned away there was nothing left but a hole his eye was still good but all around it was a twisted mass of scar slick black flesh hard as leather pocked with craters and fissured by deep cracks that gleamed red and wet when he moved down by his jaw you could see a hint of bone where the flesh had been seared away sansa began to cry he let go of her then and snuffed out the torch in the dirt no pretty words for that girl no little compliment the septa taught you when there was no answer he continued most of them they think it was some battle a siege a burning tower an enemy with a torch one fool asked if it was dragonsbreath his laugh was softer this time but just as bitter ill tell you what it was girl he said a voice from the night a shadow leaning so close now that she could smell the sour stench of wine on his breath i was younger than you six maybe seven a woodcarver set up shop in the village under my fathers keep and to buy favor he sent us gifts the old man made marvelous toys i dont remember what i got but it was gregors gift i wanted a wooden knight all painted up every joint pegged separate and fixed with strings so you could make him fight gregor is five years older than me the toy was nothing to him he was already a squire near six foot tall and muscled like an ox so i took his knight but there was no joy to it i tell you i was scared all the while and true enough he found me there was a brazier in the room gregor never said a word just picked me up under his arm and shoved the side of my face down in the burning coals and held me there while i screamed and screamed you saw how strong he is even then it took three grown men to drag him off me the septons preach about the seven hells what do they know only a man whos been burned knows what hell is truly like page george rr martin my father told everyone my bedding had caught fire and our maester gave me ointments ointments gregor got his ointments too four years later they anointed him with the seven oils and he recited his knightly vows and rhaegar targaryen tapped him on the shoulder and said arise ser gregor the rasping voice trailed off he squatted silently before her a hulking black shape shrouded in the night hidden from her eyes sansa could hear his ragged breathing she was sad for him she realized somehow the fear had gone away the silence went on and on so long that she began to grow afraid once more but she was afraid for him now not for herself she found his massive shoulder with her hand he was no true knight she whispered to him the hound threw back his head and roared sansa stumbled back away from him but he caught her arm no he growled at her no little bird he was no true knight the rest of the way into the city sandor clegane said not a word he led her to where the carts were waiting told a driver to take them back to the red keep and climbed in after her they rode in silence through the kings gate and up torchlit city streets he opened the postern door and led her into the castle his burned face twitching and his eyes brooding and he was one step behind her as they climbed the tower stairs he took her safe all the way to the corridor outside her bedchamber thank you my lord sansa said meekly the hound caught her by the arm and leaned close the things i told you tonight he said his voice sounding even rougher than usual if you ever tell joffrey your sister your father any of them i wont sansa whispered i promise it was not enough if you ever tell anyone he finished ill kill you eddard i stood last vigil for him myself ser barristan selmy said as they looked down at the body in the back of the cart he had no one else a mother in the vale i am told in the pale dawn light the young knight looked as though he were sleeping he had not been handsome but death had smoothed his roughhewn features and the silent sisters had dressed him in his best velvet tunic with a high collar to cover the ruin the lance had made of his throat eddard stark looked at his face and wondered if it had been for his sake that the boy had died slain by a lannister bannerman before ned could speak to him could that be mere happenstance he supposed he would never know hugh was jon arryns squire for four years selmy went on the king knighted him before he rode north in jons memory the lad wanted it desperately yet i fear he was not ready page ned had slept badly last night and he felt tired beyond his years none of us is ever ready he said for knighthood for death gently ned covered the boy with his cloak a bloodstained bit of blue bordered in crescent moons when his mother asked why her son was dead he reflected bitterly they would tell her he had fought to honor the kings hand eddard stark this was needless war should not be a game ned turned to the woman beside the cart shrouded in grey face hidden but for her eyes the silent sisters prepared men for the grave and it was ill fortune to look on the face of death send his armor home to the vale the mother will want to have it it is worth a fair piece of silver ser barristan said the boy had it forged special for the tourney plain work but good i do not know if he had finished paying the smith he paid yesterday my lord and he paid dearly ned replied and to the silent sister he said send the mother the armor i will deal with this smith she bowed her head afterward ser barristan walked with ned to the kings pavilion the camp was beginning to stir fat sausages sizzled and spit over firepits spicing the air with the scents of garlic and pepper young squires hurried about on errands as their masters woke yawning and stretching to meet the day a serving man with a goose under his arm bent his knee when he caught sight of them nilords he muttered as the goose honked and pecked at his fingers the shields displayed outside each tent heralded its occupant the silver eagle of seagard bryce carons field of nightingales a cluster of grapes for the redwynes brindled boar red ox burning tree white ram triple spiral purple unicorn dancing maiden blackadder twin towers horned owl and last the pure white blazons of the kingsguard shining like the dawn the king means to fight in the melee today ser barristan said as they were passing ser meryns shield its paint sullied by a deep gash where loras tyrells lance had scarred the wood as he drove him from his saddle yes ned said grimly jory had woken him last night to bring him that news small wonder he had slept so badly ser barristans look was troubled they say nights beauties fade at dawn and the children of wine are oft disowned in the morning light they say so ned agreed but not of robert other men might reconsider words spoken in drunken bravado but robert baratheon would remember and remembering would never back down the kings pavilion was close by the water and the morning mists off the river had wreathed it in wisps of grey it was all of golden silk the largest and grandest structure in the camp outside the entrance roberts warhammer was displayed beside an immense iron shield blazoned with the crowned stag of house baratheon ned had hoped to discover the king still abed in a winesoaked sleep but luck was not with him they found robert drinking beer from a polished horn and roaring his displeasure at two young squires who were trying to buckle him into his armor your grace one was page saying almost in tears its made too small it wont go he fumbled and the gorget he was trying to fit around roberts thick neck tumbled to the ground seven hells robert swore do i have to do it myself piss on the both of you pick it up dont just stand there gaping lance pick it up the lad jumped and the king noticed his company look at these oafs ned my wife insisted i take these two to squire for me and theyre worse than useless cant even put a mans armor on him properly squires they say i say theyre swineherds dressed up in silk ned only needed a glance to understand the difficulty the boys are not at fault he told the king youre too fat for your armor robert robert baratheon took a long swallow of beer tossed the empty horn onto his sleeping furs wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and said darkly fat fat is it is that how you speak to your king he let go his laughter sudden as a storm ah damn you ned why are you always right the squires smiled nervously until the king turned on them you yes both of you you heard the hand the king is too fat for his armor go find ser aron santagar tell him i need the breastplate stretcher now what are you waiting for the boys tripped over each other in their haste to be quit of the tent robert managed to keep a stern face until they were gone then he dropped back into a chair shaking with laughter ser barristan selmy chuckled with him even eddard stark managed a smile always though the graver thoughts crept in he could not help taking note of the two squires handsome boys fair and well made one was sansas age with long golden curls the other perhaps fifteen sandyhaired with a wisp of a mustache and the emeraldgreen eyes of the queen ah i wish i could be there to see santagars face robert said i hope hell have the wit to send them to someone else we ought to keep them running all day those boys ned asked him lannisters robert nodded wiping tears from his eyes cousins sons of lord tywins brother one of the dead ones or perhaps the live one now that i come to think on it i dont recall my wife comes from a very large family ned a very ambitious family ned thought he had nothing against the squires but it troubled him to see robert surrounded by the queens kin waking and sleeping the lannister appetite for offices and honors seemed to know no bounds the talk is you and the queen had angry words last night the mirth curdled on roberts face the woman tried to forbid me to fight in the melee shes sulking in the castle now damn her your sister would never have shamed me like that you never knew lyanna as i did robert ned told him you saw her beauty but not the iron underneath she would have told you that you have no business in the melee page you too the king frowned you are a sour man stark too long in the north all the juices have frozen inside you well mine are still running he slapped his chest to prove it you are the king ned reminded him i sit on the damn iron seat when i must does that mean i dont have the same hungers as other men a bit of wine now and again a girl squealing in bed the feel of a horse between my legs seven hells ned i want to hit someone ser barristan selmy spoke up your grace he said it is not seemly that the king should ride into the melee it would not be a fair contest who would dare strike you robert seemed honestly taken aback why all of them damn it if they can and the last man left standing will be you ned finished he saw at once that selmy had hit the mark the dangers of the melee were only a savor to robert but this touched on his pride ser barristan is right theres not a man in the seven kingdoms who would dare risk your displeasure by hurting you the king rose to his feet his face flushed are you telling me those prancing cravens will let me win for a certainty ned said and ser barristan selmy bowed his head in silent accord for a moment robert was so angry he could not speak he strode across the tent whirled strode back his face dark and angry he snatched up his breastplate from the ground and threw it at barristan selmy in a wordless fury selmy dodged get out the king said then coldly get out before i kill you ser barristan left quickly ned was about to follow when the king called out again not you ned ned turned back robert took up his horn again filled it with beer from a barrel in the corner and thrust it at ned drink he said brusquely ive no thirst diink your king commands it ned took the horn and drank the beer was black and thick so strong it stung the eyes robert sat down again damn you ned stark you and jon arryn i loved you both what have you done to me you were the one should have been king you or jon you had the better claim your grace i told you to drink not to argue you made me king you could at least have the courtesy to listen when i talk damn you look at me ned look at what kinging has done to me gods too fat for my armor how did it ever come to this page robert drink and stay quiet the king is talking i swear to you i was never so alive as when i was winning this throne or so dead as now that ive won it and cersei i have jon arryn to thank for her i had no wish to marry after lyanna was taken from me but jon said the realm needed an heir cersei lannister would be a good match he told me she would bind lord tywin to me should viserys targaryen ever try to win back his fathers throne the king shook his head i loved that old man i swear it but now i think he was a bigger fool than moon boy oh cersei is lovely to look at truly but cold the way she guards her cunt youd think she had all the gold of casterly rock between her legs here give me that beer if you wont drink it he took the horn upended it belched wiped his mouth i am sorry for your girl ned truly about the wolf i mean my son was lying id stake my soul on it my son you love your children dont you with all my heart ned said let me tell you a secret ned more than once i have dreamed of giving up the crown take ship for the free cities with my horse and my hammer spend my time warring and whoring thats what i was made for the sellsword king how the singers would love me you know what stops me the thought of joffrey on the throne with cersei standing behind him whispering in his ear my son how could i have made a son like that ned hes only a boy ned said awkwardly he had small liking for prince joffrey but he could hear the pain in roberts voice have you forgotten how wild you were at his age it would not trouble me if the boy was wild ned you dont know him as i do he sighed and shook his head ah perhaps you are right jon despaired of me often enough yet i grew into a good king robert looked at ned and scowled at his silence you might speak up and agree now you know your grace ned began carefully robert slapped ned on the back ah say that im a better king than aerys and be done with it you never could lie for love nor honor ned stark im still young and now that youre here with me things will be different well make this a reign to sing of and damn the lannisters to seven hells i smell bacon who do you think our champion will be today have you seen mace tyrells boy the knight of flowers they call him now theres a son any man would be proud to own to last tourney he dumped the kingslayer on his golden rump you ought to have seen the look on cerseis face i laughed till my sides hurt renly says he has this sister a maid of fourteen lovely as a dawn they broke their fast on black bread and boiled goose eggs and fish fried up with onions and bacon at a trestle table by the rivers edge the kings melancholy melted away with the morning mist and before long robert was eating an orange and waxing fond about a morning at the eyrie when they had been boys had given jon a barrel of oranges remember only the things had gone rotten so i flung mine across the table and hit dacks right in the nose you remember redforts pockfaced squire he tossed one back at me and before jon could so much as fart there were oranges flying across the high hall in every direction he laughed uproariously and even ned smiled remembering this was the boy he had grown up with he thought this was the robert baratheon hed known and loved if he could prove that the lannisters were behind the attack on bran prove that they had page murdered jon arryn this man would listen then cersei would fall and the kingslayer with her and if lord tywin dared to rouse the west robert would smash him as he had smashed rhaegar targaryen on the trident he could see it all so clearly that breakfast tasted better than anything eddard stark had eaten in a long time and afterward his smiles came easier and more often until it was time for the tournament to resume ned walked with the king to the jousting field he had promised to watch the final tilts with sansa septa mordane was ill today and his daughter was determined not to miss the end of the jousting as he saw robert to his place he noted that cersei lannister had chosen not to appear the place beside the king was empty that too gave ned cause to hope he shouldered his way to where his daughter was seated and found her as the horns blew for the days first joust sansa was so engrossed she scarcely seemed to notice his arrival sandor clegane was the first rider to appear he wore an olivegreen cloak over his sootgrey armor that and his houndshead helm were his only concession to ornament a hundred golden dragons on the kingslayer littlefinger announced loudly as jaime lannister entered the lists riding an elegant blood bay destrier the horse wore a blanket of gilded ringmail and jaime glittered from head to heel even his lance was fashioned from the golden wood of the summer isles done lord renly shouted back the hound has a hungry look about him this morning even hungry dogs know better than to bite the hand that feeds them littlefinger called dryly sandor clegane dropped his visor with an audible clang and took up his position ser jaime tossed a kiss to some woman in the commons gently lowered his visor and rode to the end of the lists both men couched their lances ned stark would have loved nothing so well as to see them both lose but sansa was watching it all moisteyed and eager the hastily erected gallery trembled as the horses broke into a gallop the hound leaned forward as he rode his lance rock steady but jaime shifted his seat deftly in the instant before impact cleganes point was turned harmlessly against the golden shield with the lion blazon while his own hit square wood shattered and the hound reeled fighting to keep his seat sansa gasped a ragged cheer went up from the commons i wonder how i ought spend your money littlefinger called down to lord renly the hound just managed to stay in his saddle he jerked his mount around hard and rode back to the lists for the second pass jaime lannister tossed down his broken lance and snatched up a fresh one jesting with his squire the hound spurred forward at a hard gallop lannister rode to meet him this time when jaime shifted his seat sandor clegane shifted with him both lances exploded and by the time the splinters had settled a riderless blood bay was trotting off in search of grass while ser jaime lannister rolled in the dirt golden and dented sansa said i knew the hound would win page littlefinger overheard if you know whos going to win the second match speak up now before lord renly plucks me clean he called to her ned smiled a pity the imp is not here with us lord renly said i should have won twice as much jaime lannister was back on his feet but his ornate lion helmet had been twisted around and dented in his fall and now he could not get it off the commons were hooting and pointing the lords and ladies were trying to stifle their chuckles and failing and over it all ned could hear king robert laughing louder than anyone finally they had to lead the lion of lannister off to a blacksmith blind and stumbling by then ser gregor clegane was in position at the head of the lists he was huge the biggest man that eddard stark had ever seen robert baratheon and his brothers were all big men as was the hound and back at winterfell there was a simpleminded stableboy named hodor who dwarfed them all but the knight they called the mountain that rides would have towered over hodor he was well over seven feet tall closer to eight with massive shoulders and arms thick as the trunks of small trees his destrier seemed a pony in between his armored legs and the lance he carried looked as small as a broom handle unlike his brother ser gregor did not live at court he was a solitary man who seldom left his own lands but for wars and tourneys he had been with lord tywin when kings landing fell a newmade knight of seventeen years even then distinguished by his size and his implacable ferocity some said it had been gregor whod dashed the skull of the infant prince aegon targaryen against a wall and whispered that afterward he had raped the mother the dornish princess elia before putting her to the sword these things were not said in gregors hearing ned stark could not recall ever speaking to the man though gregor had ridden with them during balon greyjoys rebellion one knight among thousands he watched him with disquiet ned seldom put much stock in gossip but the things said of ser gregor were more than ominous he was soon to be married for the third time and one heard dark whisperings about the deaths of his first two wives it was said that his keep was a grim place where servants disappeared unaccountably and even the dogs were afraid to enter the hall and there had been a sister who had died young under queer circumstances and the fire that had disfigured his brother and the hunting accident that had killed their father gregor had inherited the keep the gold and the family estates his younger brother sandor had left the same day to take service with the lannisters as a sworn sword and it was said that he had never returned not even to visit when the knight of flowers made his entrance a murmur ran through the crowd and he heard sansas fervent whisper oh hes so beautifuc ser loras tyrell was slender as a reed dressed in a suit of fabulous silver armor polished to a blinding sheen and filigreed with twining black vines and tiny blue forgetmenots the commons realized in the same instant as ned that the blue of the flowers came from sapphires a gasp went up from a thousand throats across the boys shoulders his cloak hung heavy it was woven of forgetmenots real ones hundreds of fresh blooms sewn to a heavy woolen cape page his courser was as slim as her rider a beautiful grey mare built for speed ser gregors huge stallion trumpeted as he caught her scent the boy from highgarden did something with his legs and his horse pranced sideways nimble as a dancer sansa clutched at his arm father dont let ser gregor hurt him she said ned saw she was wearing the rose that ser loras had given her yesterday jory had told him about that as well these are tourney lances he told his daughter they make them to splinter on impact so no one is hurt yet he remembered the dead boy in the cart with his cloak of crescent moons and the words were raw in his throat ser gregor was having trouble controlling his horse the stallion was screaming and pawing the ground shaking his head the mountain kicked at the animal savagely with an armored boot the horse reared and almost threw him the knight of flowers saluted the king rode to the far end of the list and couched his lance ready ser gregor brought his animal to the line fighting with the reins and suddenly it began the mountains stallion broke in a hard gallop plunging forward wildly while the mare charged as smooth as a flow of silk ser gregor wrenched his shield into position juggled with his lance and all the while fought to hold his unruly mount on a straight line and suddenly loras tyrell was on him placing the point of his lance just there and in an eye blink the mountain was failing he was so huge that he took his horse down with him in a tangle of steel and flesh ned heard applause cheers whistles shocked gasps excited muttering and over it all the rasping raucous laughter of the hound the knight of flowers reined up at the end of the lists his lance was not even broken his sapphires winked in the sun as he raised his visor smiling the commons went mad for him in the middle of the field ser gregor clegane disentangled himself and came boiling to his feet he wrenched off his helm and slammed it down onto the ground his face was dark with fury and his hair fell down into his eyes my sword he shouted to his squire and the boy ran it out to him by then his stallion was back on its feet as well gregor clegane killed the horse with a single blow of such ferocity that it half severed the animals neck cheers turned to shrieks in a heartbeat the stallion went to its knees screaming as it died by then gregor was striding down the lists toward ser loras tyrell his bloody sword clutched in his fist stop him ned shouted but his words were lost in the roar everyone else was yelling as well and sansa was crying it all happened so fast the knight of flowers was shouting for his own sword as ser gregor knocked his squire aside and made a grab for the reins of his horse the mare scented blood and reared loras tyrell kept his seat but barely ser gregor swung his sword a savage twohanded blow that took the boy in the chest and knocked him from the saddle the courser dashed away in panic as ser loras lay stunned in the dirt but as gregor lifted his sword for the killing blow a rasping voice warned leave him be and a steelclad hand wrenched him away from the boy the mountain pivoted in wordless fury swinging his longsword in a killing arc with all his massive strength behind it but the hound caught the blow and turned it and for what seemed an eternity the two brothers stood hammering at each other as a dazed loras tyrell was helped to safety thrice ned saw page ser gregor aim savage blows at the houndshead helmet yet not once did sandor send a cut at his brothers unprotected face it was the kings voice that put an end to it the kings voice and twenty swords jon arryn had told them that a commander needs a good battlefield voice and robert had proved the truth of that on the trident he used that voice now stop this madness he boomed in the name of your king the hound went to one knee ser gregors blow cut air and at last he came to his senses he dropped his sword and glared at robert surrounded by his kingsguard and a dozen other knights and guardsmen wordlessly he turned and strode off shoving past barristan selmy let him go robert said and as quickly as that it was over is the hound the champion now sansa asked ned no he told her there will be one final joust between the hound and the knight of flowers but sansa had the right of it after all a few moments later ser loras tyrell walked back onto the field in a simple linen doublet and said to sandor clegane i owe you my life the day is yours ser i am no ser the hound replied but he took the victory and the champions purse and for perhaps the first time in his life the love of the commons they cheered him as he left the lists to return to his pavilion as ned walked with sansa to the archery field littlefinger and lord renly and some of the others fell in with them tyrell had to know the mare was in heat littlefinger was saying i swear the boy planned the whole thing gregor has always favored huge illtempered stallions with more spirit than sense the notion seemed to amuse him it did not amuse ser barristan selmy there is small honor in tricks the old man said stiffly small honor and twenty thousand golds lord renly smiled that afternoon a boy named anguy an unheralded commoner from the dornish marches won the archery competition outshooting ser balon swann and jalabhar xho at a hundred paces after all the other bowmen had been eliminated at the shorter distances ned sent alyn to seek him out and offer him a position with the hands guard but the boy was flush with wine and victory and riches undreamed of and he refused the melee went on for three hours near forty men took part freeriders and hedge knights and newmade squires in search of a reputation they fought with blunted weapons in a chaos of mud and blood small troops fighting together and then turning on each other as alliances formed and fractured until only one man was left standing the victor was the red priest thoros of myr a madman who shaved his head and fought with a flaming sword he had won melees before the fire sword frightened the mounts of the other riders and nothing frightened thoros the final tally was three broken limbs a shattered collarbone a dozen smashed fingers two horses that had to be put down and more cuts sprains and bruises than anyone cared to count ned was desperately pleased that robert had not taken part page that night at the feast eddard stark was more hopeful than he had been in a great while robert was in high good humor the lannisters were nowhere to be seen and even his daughters were behaving jory brought arya down to join them and sansa spoke to her sister pleasantly the tournament was magnificent she sighed you should have come how was your dancing im sore all over arya reported happily proudly displaying a huge purple bruise on her leg you must be a terrible dancer sansa said doubtfully later while sansa was off listening to a troupe of singers perform the complex round of interwoven ballads called the dance of the dragons ned inspected the bruise himself i hope forel is not being too hard on you he said arya stood on one leg she was getting much better at that of late syrio says that every hurt is a lesson and every lesson makes you better ned frowned the man syrio forel had come with an excellent reputation and his flamboyant braavosi style was well suited to aryas slender blade yet still a few days ago she had been wandering around with a swatch of black silk tied over her eyes syrio was teaching her to see with her ears and her nose and her skin she told him before that he had her doing spins and back flips arya are you certain you want to persist in this she nodded tomorrow were going to catch cats cats ned sighed perhaps it was a mistake to hire this braavosi if you like i will ask jory to take over your lessons or i might have a quiet word with ser barristan he was the finest sword in the seven kingdoms in his youth i dont want them arya said i want syrio ned ran his fingers through his hair any decent masteratarms could give arya the rudiments of slashandparry without this nonsense of blindfolds cartwheels and hopping about on one leg but he knew his youngest daughter well enough to know there was no arguing with that stubborn jut of jaw as you wish he said surely she would grow tired of this soon try to be careful i will she promised solemnly as she hopped smoothly from her right leg to her left much later after he had taken the girls back through the city and seen them both safe in bed sansa with her dreams and arya with her bruises ned ascended to his own chambers atop the tower of the hand the day had been warm and the room was close and stuffy ned went to the window and unfastened the heavy shutters to let in the cool night air across the great yard he noticed the flickering glow of candlelight from littlefingers windows the hour was well past midnight down by the river the revels were only now beginning to dwindle and die he took out the dagger and studied it littlefingers blade won by tyrion lannister in a tourney wager sent to slay bran in his sleep why why would the dwarf want bran dead why would anyone want bran dead page the dagger brans fall all of it was linked somehow to the murder of jon arryn he could feel it in his gut but the truth of jons death remained as clouded to him as when he had started lord stannis had not returned to kings landing for the tourney lysa arryn held her silence behind the high walls of the eyrie the squire was dead and jory was still searching the whorehouses what did he have but roberts bastard that the armorers sullen apprentice was the kings son ned had no doubt the baratheon look was stamped on his face in his jaw his eyes that black hair renly was too young to have fathered a boy of that age stannis too cold and proud in his honor gendry had to be roberts yet knowing all that what had he learned the king had other baseborn children scattered throughout the seven kingdoms he had openly acknowledged one of his bastards a boy of brans age whose mother was highborn the lad was being fostered by lord renlys castellan at storms end ned remembered roberts first child as well a daughter born in the vale when robert was scarcely more than a boy himself a sweet little girl the young lord of storms end had doted on her he used to make daily visits to play with the babe long after he had lost interest in the mother ned was often dragged along for company whether he willed it or not the girl would be seventeen or eighteen now he realized older than robert had been when he fathered her a strange thought cersei could not have been pleased by her lord husbands byblows yet in the end it mattered little whether the king had one bastard or a hundred law and custom gave the baseborn few rights gendry the girl in the vale the boy at storms end none of them could threaten roberts trueborn children his musings were ended by a soft rap on his door a man to see you my lord harwin called he will not give his name send him in ned said wondering the visitor was a stout man in cracked mudcaked boots and a heavy brown robe of the coarsest roughspun his features hidden by a cowl his hands drawn up into voluminous sleeves who are you ned asked a friend the cowled man said in a strange low voice we must speak alone lord stark curiosity was stronger than caution harwin leave us he commanded not until they were alone behind closed doors did his visitor draw back his cowl lord varys ned said in astonishment lord stark varys said politely seating himself i wonder if i might trouble you for a drink ned filled two cups with surnmerwine and handed one to varys i might have passed within a foot of you and never recognized you he said incredulous he had never seen the eunuch dress in anything but silk and velvet and the richest damasks and this man smelled of sweat instead of lilacs page that was my dearest hope varys said it would not do if certain people learned that we had spoken in private the queen watches you closely this wine is very choice thank you how did you get past my other guards ned asked porther and cayn had been posted outside the tower and alyn on the stairs the red keep has ways known only to ghosts and spiders varys smiled apologetically i will not keep you long my lord there are things you must know you are the kings hand and the king is a fool the eunuchs cloying tones were gone now his voice was thin and sharp as a whip your friend i know yet a fool nonetheless and doomed unless you save him today was a near thing they had hoped to kill him during the melee for a moment ned was speechless with shock who varys sipped his wine if i truly need to tell you that you are a bigger fool than robert and i am on the wrong side the lannisters ned said the queen no i will not believe that not even of cersei she asked him not to fight she forbade him to fight in front of his brother his knights and half the court tell me truly do you know any surer way to force king robert into the melee i ask you ned had a sick feeling in his gut the eunuch had hit upon a truth tell robert baratheon he could not should not or must not do a thing and it was as good as done even if hed fought who would have dared to strike the king varys shrugged there were forty riders in the melee the lannisters have many friends amidst all that chaos with horses screaming and bones breaking and thoros of myr waving that absurd firesword of his who could name it murder if some chance blow felled his grace he went to the flagon and refilled his cup after the deed was done the slayer would be beside himself with grief i can almost hear him weeping so sad yet no doubt the gracious and compassionate widow would take pity lift the poor unfortunate to his feet and bless him with a gentle kiss of forgiveness good king joffrey would have no choice but to pardon him the eunuch stroked his cheek or perhaps cersei would let ser ilyn strike off his head less risk for the lannisters that way though quite an unpleasant surprise for their little friend ned felt his anger rise you knew of this plot and yet you did nothing i command whisperers not warriors you might have come to me earlier oh yes i confess it and you would have rushed straight to the king yes and when robert heard of his peril what would he have done i wonder ned considered that he would have damned them all and fought anyway to show he did not fear page them varys spread his hands i will make another confession lord eddard i was curious to see what you would do why not come to me you ask and i must answer why because i did not trust you my lord you did not trust me ned was frankly astonished the red keep shelters two sorts of people lord eddard varys said those who are loyal to the realm and those who are loyal only to themselves until this morning i could not say which you might be so i waited to see and now i know for a certainty he smiled a plump tight little smile and for a moment his private face and public mask were one i begin to comprehend why the queen fears you so much oh yes i do you are the one she ought to fear ned said no i am what i am the king makes use of me but it shames him a most puissant warrior is our robert and such a manly man has little love for sneaks and spies and eunuchs if a day should come when cersei whispers kill that man ilyn payne will snick my head off in a twinkling and who will mourn poor varys then north or south they sing no songs for spiders he reached out and touched ned with a soft hand but you lord stark i think no i know he would not kill you not even for his queen and there may lie our salvation it was all too much for a moment eddard stark wanted nothing so much as to return to winterfell to the clean simplicity of the north where the enemies were winter and the wildlings beyond the wall surely robert has other loyal friends he protested his brothers his wife varys finished with a smile that cut his brothers hate the lannisters true enough but hating the queen and loving the king are not quite the same thing are they ser barristan loves his honor grand maester pycelle loves his office and littlefinger loves littlefinger the kingsguard a paper shield the eunuch said try not to look so shocked lord stark jaime lannister is himself a sworn brother of the white swords and we all know what his oath is worth the days when men like ryam redwyne and prince aemon the dragonknight wore the white cloak are gone to dust and song of these seven only ser barristan selmy is made of the true steel and selmy is old ser boros and ser meryn are the queens creatures to the bone and i have deep suspicions of the others no my lord when the swords come out in earnest you will be the only true friend robert baratheon will have robert must be told ned said if what you say is true if even a part of it is true the king must hear it for himself and what proof shall we lay before him my words against theirs my little birds against the queen and the kingslayer against his brothers and his council against the wardens of east and west against all the might of casterly rock pray send for ser ilyn directly it will save us all some time i know where that road ends page yet if what you say is true they will only bide their time and make another attempt indeed they will said varys and sooner rather than later i do fear you are making them most anxious lord eddard but my little birds will be listening and together we may be able to forestall them you and u he rose and pulled up his cowl so his face was hidden once more thank you for the wine we will speak again when you see me next at council be certain to treat me with your accustomed contempt you should not find it difficult he was at the door when ned called varys the eunuch turned back how did jon arryn die i wondered when you would get around to that tell me the tears of lys they call it a rare and costly thing clear and sweet as water and it leaves no trace i begged lord arryn to use a taster in this very room i begged him but he would not hear of it only one who was less than a man would even think of such a thing he told me ned had to know the rest who gave him the poison some dear sweet friend who often shared meat and mead with him no doubt oh but which one there were many such lord arryn was a kindly trusting man the eunuch sighed there was one boy all he was he owed jon arryn but when the widow fled to the eyrie with her household he stayed in kings landing and prospered it always gladdens my heart to see the young rise in the world the whip was in his voice again every word a stroke he must have cut a gallant figure in the tourney him in his bright new armor with those crescent moons on his cloak a pity he died so untimely before you could talk to him ned felt halfpoisoned himself the squire he said ser hugh wheels within wheels within wheels neds head was pounding y why now jon arryn had been hand for fourteen years what was he doing that they had to kill him asking questions varys said slipping out the door tyrion as he stood in the predawn chill watching chiggen butcher his horse tyrion lannister chalked up one more debt owed the starks steam rose from inside the carcass when the squat sellsword opened the belly with his skinning knife his hands moved deftly with never a wasted cut the work had to be done quickly before the stink of blood brought shadowcats down from the heights none of us will go hungry tonight bronn said he was near a shadow himself bone thin and bone hard with black eyes and black hair and a stubble of beard some of us may tyrion told him i am not fond of eating horse particularly my horse meat is meat bronn said with a shrug the dothraki like horse more than beef or pork page do you take me for a dothraki tyrion asked sourly the dothraki ate horse in truth they also left deformed children out for the feral dogs who ran behind their khalasars dothraki customs had scant appeal for him chiggen sliced a thin strip of bloody meat off the carcass and held it up for inspection want a taste dwarf my brother jaime gave me that mare for my twentythird name day tyrion said in a flat voice thank him for us then if you ever see him again chiggen grinned showing yellow teeth and swallowed the raw meat in two bites tastes well bred better if you fry it up with onions bronn put in wordlessly tyrion limped away the cold had settled deep in his bones and his legs were so sore he could scarcely walk perhaps his dead mare was the lucky one he had hours more riding ahead of him followed by a few mouthfuls of food and a short cold sleep on hard ground and then another night of the same and another and another and the gods only knew how it would end damn her he muttered as he struggled up the road to rejoin his captors remembering damn her and all the starks the memory was still bitter one moment hed been ordering supper and an eye blink later he was facing a room of armed men with jyck reaching for a sword and the fat innkeep shrieking no swords not here please mlords tyrion wrenched down jycks arm hurriedly before he got them both hacked to pieces where are your courtesies jyck our good hostess said no swords do as she asks he forced a smile that must have looked as queasy as it felt youre making a sad mistake lady stark i had no part in any attack on your son on my honor lannister honor was all she said she held up her hands for all the room to see his dagger left these scars the blade he sent to open my sons throat tyrion felt the anger all around him thick and smoky fed by the deep cuts in the stark womans hands kill him hissed some drunken slattern from the back and other voices took up the call faster than he would have believed strangers all friendly enough only a moment ago and yet now they cried for his blood like hounds on a trail tyrion spoke up loudly trying to keep the quaver from his voice if lady stark believes i have some crime to answer for i will go with her and answer for it it was the only possible course trying to cut their way out of this was a sure invitation to an early grave a good dozen swords had responded to the stark womans plea for help the harrenhal man the three brackens a pair of unsavory sellswords who looked as though theyd kill him as soon as spit and some fool field hands who doubtless had no idea what they were doing against that what did tyrion have a dagger at his belt and two men jyck swung a fair enough sword but morrec scarcely counted he was part groom part cook part body servant and no soldier as for yoren whatever his feelings might have page been the black brothers were sworn to take no part in the quarrels of the realm yoren would do nothing and indeed the black brother stepped aside silently when the old knight by catelyn starks side said take their weapons and the sellsword bronn stepped forward to pull the sword from jycks fingers and relieve them all of their daggers good the old man said as the tension in the common room ebbed palpably excellent tyrion recognized the gruff voice winterfells masteratarms shorn of his whiskers scarlettinged spittle flew from the fat innkeeps mouth as she begged of catelyn stark dont kill him here dont kill him anywhere tyrion urged take him somewheres else no blood here mady i wants no high lordlins quarrels we are taking him back to winterfell she said and tyrion thought well perhaps by then hed had a moment to glance over the room and get a better idea of the situation he was not altogether displeased by what he saw oh the stark woman had been clever no doubt of it force them to make a public affirmation of the oaths sworn her father by the lords they served and then call on them for succor and her a woman yes that was sweet yet her success was not as complete as she might have liked there were close to fifty in the common room by his rough count catelyn starks plea had roused a bare dozen the others looked confused or frightened or sullen only two of the freys had stirred tyrion noted and theyd sat back down quick enough when their captain failed to move he might have smiled if hed dared winterfell it is then he said instead that was a long ride as he could well attest having just ridden it the other way so many things could happen along the way my father will wonder what has become of me he added catching the eye of the swordsman whod offered to yield up his room hell pay a handsome reward to any man who brings him word of what happened here today lord tywin would do no such thing of course but tyrion would make up for it if he won free ser rodrik glanced at his lady his look worried as well it might be his men come with him the old knight announced and well thank the rest of you to stay quiet about what youve seen here it was all tyrion could do not to laugh quiet the old fool unless he took the whole inn the word would begin to spread the instant they were gone the freerider with the gold coin in his pocket would fly to casterly rock like an arrow if not him then someone else yoren would carry the story south that fool singer might make a lay of it the freys would report back to their lord and the gods only knew what he might do lord walder frey might be sworn to riverrun but he was a cautious man who had lived a long time by making certain he was always on the winning side at the very least he would send his birds winging south to kings landing and he might well dare more than that catelyn stark wasted no time we must ride at once well want fresh mounts and provisions for the road you men know that you have the eternal gratitude of house stark if any of you choose to help us guard our captives and get them safe to winterfell i promise you shall be well rewarded that was all it page took the fools came rushing forward tyrion studied their faces they would indeed be well rewarded he vowed to himself but perhaps not quite as they imagined yet even as they were bundling him outside saddling the horses in the rain and tying his hands with a length of coarse rope tyrion lannister was not truly afraid they would never get him to winterfell he would have given odds on that riders would be after them within the day birds would take wing and surely one of the river lords would want to curry favor with his father enough to take a hand tyrion was congratulating himself on his subtlety when someone pulled a hood down over his eyes and lifted him up onto a saddle they set out through the rain at a hard gallop and before long tyrions thighs were cramped and aching and his butt throbbed with pain even when they were safely away from the inn and catelyn stark slowed them to a trot it was a miserable pounding journey over rough ground made worse by his blindness every twist and turn put him in danger of falling off his horse the hood muffled sound so he could not make out what was being said around him and the rain soaked through the cloth and made it cling to his face until even breathing was a struggle the rope chafed his wrists raw and seemed to grow tighter as the night wore on i was about to settle down to a warm fire and a roast fowl and that wretched singer had to open his mouth he thought mournfully the wretched singer had come along with them there is a great song to be made from this and im the one to make it he told catelyn stark when he announced his intention of riding with them to see how the splendid adventure turned out tyrion wondered whether the boy would think the adventure quite so splendid once the lannister riders caught up with them the rain had finally stopped and dawn light was seeping through the wet cloth over his eyes when catelyn stark gave the command to dismount rough hands pulled him down from his horse untied his wrists and yanked the hood off his head when he saw the narrow stony road the foothills rising high and wild all around them and the jagged snowcapped peaks on the distant horizon all the hope went out of him in a rush this is the high road he gasped looking at lady stark with accusation the eastem road you said we were riding for winterfell catelyn stark favored him with the faintest of smiles often and loudly she agreed no doubt your friends will ride that way when they come after us i wish them good speed even now long days later the memory filled him with a bitter rage all his life tyrion had prided himself on his cunning the only gift the gods had seen fit to give him and yet this seventimesdamned shewolf catelyn stark had outwitted him at every turn the knowledge was more galling than the bare fact of his abduction they stopped only as long as it took to feed and water the horses and then they were off again this time tyrion was spared the hood after the second night they no longer bound his hands and once they had gained the heights they scarcely bothered to guard him at all it seemed they did not fear his escape and why should they up here the land was harsh and wild and the high road little more than a stony track if he did run how far could he hope to go alone and without provisions the shadowcats would make a morsel of him and the clans that dwelt in the mountain fastnesses were brigands and murderers who bowed to no law but the sword yet still the stark woman drove them forward relentlessly he knew where they were bound he had known it since the moment they pulled off his hood these mountains were the domain of house arryn page and the late hands widow was a tully catelyn starks sister and no friend to the lannisters tyrion had known the lady lysa slightly during her years at kings landing and did not look forward to renewing the acquaintance his captors were clustered around a stream a short ways down the high road the horses had drunk their fill of the icy cold water and were grazing on clumps of brown grass that grew from clefts in the rock jyck and morrec huddled close sullen and miserable mohor stood over them leaning on his spear and wearing a rounded iron cap that made him look as if he had a bowl on his head nearby marillion the singer sat oiling his woodharp complaining of what the damp was doing to his strings we must have some rest my lady the hedge knight ser willis wode was saying to catelyn stark as tyrion approached he was lady whents man stiffnecked and stolid and the first to rise to aid catelyn stark back at the inn ser willis speaks truly my lady ser rodrik said this is the third horse we have lost we will lose more than horses if were overtaken by the lannisters she reminded them her face was windburnt and gaunt but it had lost none of its determination small chance of that here tyrion put in the lady did not ask your views dwarf snapped kurleket a great fat oaf with shortcropped hair and a pigs face he was one of the brackens a manatarms in the service of lord jonos tyrion had made a special effort to learn all their names so he might thank them later for their tender treatment of him a lannister always paid his debts kurleket would learn that someday as would his friends lharys and mohor and the good ser willis and the sellswords bronn and chiggen he planned an especially sharp lesson for marillion him of the woodharp and the sweet tenor voice who was struggling so manfully to rhyme imp with gimp and limp so he could make a song of this outrage let him speak lady stark commanded tyrion lannister seated himself on a rock by now our pursuit is likely racing across the neck chasing your lie up the kingsroad assuming there is a pursuit which is by no means certain oh no doubt the word has reached my father but my father does not love me overmuch and i am not at all sure that he will bother to bestir himself it was only half a lie lord tywin lannister cared not a fig for his deformed son but he tolerated no slights on the honor of his house this is a cruel land lady stark youll find no succor until you reach the vale and each mount you lose burdens the others all the more worse you risk losing me i am small and not strong and if i die then whats the point that was no lie at all tyrion did not know how much longer he could endure this pace it might be said that your death is the point lannister catelyn stark replied i think not tyrion said if you wanted me dead you had only to say the word and one of these staunch friends of yours would gladly have given me a red smile he looked at kurleket but the man was too dim to taste the mockery the starks do not murder men in their beds page nor do i he saidi tell you again i had no part in the attempt to kill your son the assassin was armed with your dagger tyrion felt the heat rise in him it was not my dagger he insisted how many times must i swear to that lady stark whatever you may believe of me i am not a stupid man only a fool would arm a common footpad with his own blade just for a moment he thought he saw a flicker of doubt in her eyes but what she said was why would petyr lie to me why does a bear shit in the woods he demanded because it is his nature lying comes as easily as breathing to a man like littlefinger you ought to know that you of all people she took a step toward him her face tight and what does that mean lannister tyrion cocked his head why every man at court has heard him tell how he took your maidenhead my lady that is a lie catelyn stark said oh wicked little imp marillion said shocked kurleket drew his dirk a vicious piece of black iron at your word mlady ill toss his lying tongue at your feet his pig eyes were wet with excitement at the prospect catelyn stark stared at tyrion with a coldness on her face such as he had never seen petyr baelish loved me once he was only a boy his passion was a tragedy for all of us but it was real and pure and nothing to be made mock of he wanted my hand that is the truth of the matter you are truly an evil man lannister and you are truly a fool lady stark littlefinger has never loved anyone but littlefinger and i promise you that it is not your hand that he boasts of its those ripe breasts of yours and that sweet mouth and the heat between your legs kurleket grabbed a handful of hair and yanked his head back in a hard jerk baring his throat tyrion felt the cold kiss of steel beneath his chin shall i bleed him my lady kill me and the truth dies with me tyrion gasped let him talk catelyn stark commanded kurleket let go of tyrions hair reluctantly tyrion took a deep breath how did littlefinger tell you i came by this dagger of his answer me that you won it from him in a wager during the tourney on prince joffreys name day when my brother jaime was unhorsed by the knight of flowers that was his story no page it was she admitted a line creased her brow riders the shriek came from the windcarved ridge above them ser rodrik had sent lharys scrambling up the rock face to watch the road while they took their rest for a long second no one moved catelyn stark was the first to react ser rodrik ser willis to horse she shouted get the other mounts behind us mohor guard the prisoners arm us tyrion sprang to his feet and seized her by the arm you will need every sword she knew he was right tyrion could see it the mountain clans cared nothing for the enmities of the great houses they would slaughter stark and lannister with equal fervor as they slaughtered each other they might spare catelyn herself she was still young enough to bear sons still she hesitated i hear them ser rodrik called out tyrion turned his head to listen and there it was hoofbeats a dozen horses or more coming nearer suddenly everyone was moving reaching for weapons running to their mounts pebbles rained down around them as lharys came springing and sliding down the ridge he landed breathless in front of catelyn stark an ungainlylooking man with wild tufts of rustcolored hair sticking out from under a conical steel cap twenty men maybe twentyfive he said breathless milk snakes or moon brothers by my guess they must have eyes out mady hidden watchers they know were here ser rodrik cassel was already ahorse a longsword in hand mohor crouched behind a boulder both hands on his irontipped spear a dagger between his teeth you singer ser willis wode called out help me with this breastplate marillion sat frozen clutching his woodharp his face as pale as milk but tyrions man morrec bounded quickly to his feet and moved to help the knight with his armor tyrion kept his grip on catelyn stark you have no choice he told her three of us and a fourth man wasted guarding us four men can be the difference between life and death up here give me your word that you will put down your swords again after the fight is done my word the hoofbeats were louder now tyrion grinned crookedly oh that you have my lady on my honor as a lannister for a moment he thought she would spit at him but instead she snapped arm them and as quick as that she was pulling away ser rodrik tossed jyck his sword and scabbard and wheeled to meet the foe morrec helped himself to a bow and quiver and went to one knee beside the road he was a better archer than swordsman and bronn rode up to offer tyrion a doublebladed axe i have never fought with an axe the weapon felt awkward and unfamiliar in his hands it had a short page haft a heavy head a nasty spike on top pretend youre splitting logs bronn said drawing his longsword from the scabbard across his back he spat and trotted off to form up beside chiggen and ser rodrik ser willis mounted up to join them fumbling with his helmet a metal pot with a thin slit for his eyes and a long black silk plume logs dont bleed tyrion said to no one in particular he felt naked without armor he looked around for a rock and ran over to where marillion was hiding move over go away the boy screamed back at him im a singer i want no part of this fight what lost your taste for adventure tyrion kicked at the youth until he slid over and not a moment too soon a heartbeat later the riders were on them there were no heralds no banners no horns nor drums only the twang of bowstrings as morrec and lharys let fly and suddenly the clansmen came thundering out of the dawn lean dark men in boiled leather and mismatched armor faces hidden behind barred halffielms in gloved hands were clutched all manner of weapons longswords and lances and sharpened scythes spiked clubs and daggers and heavy iron mauls at their head rode a big man in a striped shadowskin cloak armed with a twohanded greatsword ser rodrik shouted winterfell and rode to meet him with bronn and chiggen beside him screaming some wordless battle cry ser willis wode followed swinging a spiked morningstar around his head harrenhal harrenhal he sang tyrion felt a sudden urge to leap up brandish his axe and boom out casterly rock but the insanity passed quickly and he crouched down lower he heard the screams of frightened horses and the crash of metal on metal chiggens sword raked across the naked face of a mailed rider and bronn plunged through the clansmen like a whirlwind cutting down foes right and left ser rodrik hammered at the big man in the shadowskin cloak their horses dancing round each other as they traded blow for blow jyck vaulted onto a horse and galloped bareback into the fray tyrion saw an arrow sprout from the throat of the man in the shadowskin cloak when he opened his mouth to scream only blood came out by the time he fell ser rodrik was fighting someone else suddenly marillion shrieked covering his head with his woodharp as a horse leapt over their rock tyrion scrambled to his feet as the rider turned to come back at them hefting a spiked maul tyrion swung his axe with both hands the blade caught the charging horse in the throat with a meaty thunk angling upward and tyrion almost lost his grip as the animal screamed and collapsed he managed to wrench the axe free and lurch clumsily out of the way marillion was less fortunate horse and rider crashed to the ground in a tangle on top of the singer tyrion danced back in while the brigands leg was still pinned beneath his fallen mount and buried the axe in the mans neck just above the shoulder blades as he struggled to yank the blade loose he heard marillion moaning under the bodies someone help me the singer gasped gods have mercy im bleeding i believe thats horse blood tyrion said the singers hand came crawling out from beneath the dead animal scrabbling in the dirt like a spider with five legs tyrion put his heel on the grasping fingers and felt page a satisfying crunch close your eyes and pretend youre dead he advised the singer before he hefted the axe and turned away after that things ran together the dawn was full of shouts and screams and heavy with the scent of blood and the world had turned to chaos arrows hissed past his ear and clattered off the rocks he saw bronn unhorsed fighting with a sword in each hand tyrion kept on the fringes of the fight sliding from rock to rock and darting out of the shadows to hew at the legs of passing horses he found a wounded clansman and left him dead helping himself to the mans halfhelm it fit too snugly but tyrion was glad of any protection at all jyck was cut down from behind while he sliced at a man in front of him and later tyrion stumbled over kurlekets body the pig face had been smashed in with a mace but tyrion recognized the dirk as he plucked it from the mans dead fingers he was sliding it through his belt when he heard a womans scream catelyn stark was trapped against the stone face of the mountain with three men around her one still mounted and the other two on foot she had a dagger clutched awkwardly in her maimed hands but her back was to the rock now and they had penned her on three sides let them have the bitch tyrion thought and welcome to her yet somehow he was moving he caught the first man in the back of the knee before they even knew he was there and the heavy axehead split flesh and bone like rotten wood logs that bleed tyrion thought inanely as the second man came for him tyrion ducked under his sword lashed out with the axe the man reeled backward and catelyn stark stepped up behind him and opened his throat the horseman remembered an urgent engagement elsewhere and galloped off suddenly tyrion looked around the enemy were all vanquished or vanished somehow the fighting had ended when he wasnt looking dying horses and wounded men lay all around screaming or moaning to his vast astonishment he was not one of them he opened his fingers and let the axe thunk to the ground his hands were sticky with blood he could have sworn they had been fighting for half a day but the sun seemed scarcely to have moved at all your first battle bronn asked later as he bent over jycks body pulling off his boots they were good boots as befit one of lord tywins men heavy leather oiled and supple much finer than what bronn was wearing tyrion nodded my father will be so proud he said his legs were cramping so badly he could scarcely stand odd he had never once noticed the pain during the battle you need a woman now bronn said with a glint in his black eyes he shoved the boots into his saddlebag nothing like a woman after a mans been blooded take my word chiggen stopped looting the corpses of the brigands long enough to snort and lick his lips tyrion glanced over to where lady stark was dressing ser rodriks wounds im willing if she is he said the freeriders broke into laughter and tyrion grinned and thought theres a start afterward he knelt by the stream and washed the blood off his face in water cold as ice as he limped back to the others he glanced again at the slain the dead clansmen were thin ragged men their horses scrawny and undersized with every rib showing what weapons bronn and chiggen had left them were none too impressive mauls clubs a scythe he remembered the big man in the shadowskin cloak who had dueled ser rodrik with a twohanded greatsword but when he found his corpse sprawled on page the stony ground the man was not so big after all the cloak was gone and tyrion saw that the blade was badly notched its cheap steel spotted with rust small wonder the clansmen had left nine bodies on the ground they had only three dead two of lord brackens menatarms kurleket and mohor and his own man jyck who had made such a bold show with his bareback charge a fool to the end tyrion thought lady stark i urge you to press on with all haste ser willis wode said his eyes scanning the ridgetops warily through the slit in his helm we drove them off for the moment but they will not have gone far we must bury our dead ser willis she said these were brave men i will not leave them to the crows and shadowcats this soil is too stony for digging ser willis said then we shall gather stones for cairns gather all the stones you want bronn told her but do it without me or chiggen ive better things to do than pile rocks on dead men breathing for one he looked over the rest of the survivors any of you who hope to be alive come nightfall ride with us my lady i fear he speaks the truth ser rodrik said wearily the old knight had been wounded in the fight a deep gash in his left arm and a spear thrust that grazed his neck and he sounded his age if we linger here they will be on us again for a certainty and we may not live through a second attack tyrion could see the anger in catelyns face but she had no choice may the gods forgive us then we will ride at once there was no shortage of horses now tyrion moved his saddle to jycks spotted gelding who looked strong enough to last another three or four days at least he was about to mount when lharys stepped up and said ill take that dirk now dwarf let him keep it catelyn stark looked down from her horse and see that he has his axe back as well we may have need of it if we are attacked again you have my thanks lady tyrion said mounting up save them she said curtly i trust you no more than i did before she was gone before he could frame a reply tyrion adjusted his stolen helm and took the axe from bronn he remembered how he had begun the journey with his wrists bound and a hood pulled down over his head and decided that this was a definite improvement lady stark could keep her trust so long as he could keep the axe he would count himself ahead in the game ser willis wode led them out bronn took the rear with lady stark safely in the middle ser rodrik a shadow beside her marillion kept throwing sullen looks back at tyrion as they rode the singer had broken several ribs his woodharp and all four fingers on his playing hand yet the day had not been an page utter loss to him somewhere he had acquired a magnificent shadowskin cloak thick black fur slashed by stripes of white he huddled beneath its folds silently and for once had nothing to say they heard the deep growls of shadowcats behind them before they had gone half a mile and later the wild snarling of the beasts fighting over the corpses they had left behind marillion grew visibly pale tyrion trotted up beside him craven he said rhymes nicely with raven he kicked his horse and moved past the singer up to ser rodrik and catelyn stark she looked at him lips pressed tightly together as i was saying before we were so rudely interrupted tyrion began there is a serious flaw in littlefingers fable whatever you may believe of me lady stark i promise you this never bet against my family arya the oneeared black tom arched his back and hissed at her arya padded down the alley balanced lightly on the balls of her bare feet listening to the flutter of her heart breathing slow deep breaths quiet as a shadow she told herself light as a feather the tomcat watched her come his eyes wary catching cats was hard her hands were covered with halfhealed scratches and both knees were scabbed over where she had scraped them raw in tumbles at first even the cooks huge fat kitchen cat had been able to elude her but syrio had kept her at it day and night when shed run to him with her hands bleeding he had said so slow be quicker girl your enemies will give you more than scratches he had dabbed her wounds with myrish fire which burned so bad she had had to bite her lip to keep from screaming then he sent her out after more cats the red keep was full of cats lazy old cats dozing in the sun coldeyed mousers twitching their tails quick little kittens with claws like needles ladies cats all combed and trusting ragged shadows prowling the midden heaps one by one arya had chased them down and snatched them up and brought them proudly to syrio forel all but this one this oneeared black devil of a tomcat thats the real king of this castle right there one of the gold cloaks had told her older than sin and twice as mean one time the king was feasting the queens father and that black bastard hopped up on the table and snatched a roast quail right out of lord tywins fingers robert laughed so hard he like to burst you stay away from that one child he had run her halfway across the castle twice around the tower of the hand across the inner bailey through the stables down the serpentine steps past the small kitchen and the pig yard and the barracks of the gold cloaks along the base of the river wall and up more steps and back and forth over traitors walk and then down again and through a gate and around a well and in and out of strange buildings until arya didnt know where she was page now at last she had him high walls pressed close on either side and ahead was a blank windowless mass of stone quiet as a shadow she repeated sliding forward light as a feather when she was three steps away from him the tomcat bolted left then right he went and right then left went arya cutting off his escape he hissed again and tried to dart between her legs quick as a snake she thought her hands closed around him she hugged him to her chest whirling and laughing aloud as his claws raked at the front of her leather jerkin ever so fast she kissed him right between the eyes and jerked her head back an instant before his claws would have found her face the tomcat yowled and spit whats he doing to that cat startled arya dropped the cat and whirled toward the voice the torn bounded off in the blink of an eye at the end of the alley stood a girl with a mass of golden curls dressed as pretty as a doll in blue satin beside her was a plump little blond boy with a prancing stag sewn in pearls across the front of his doublet and a miniature sword at his belt princess myrcella and prince tommen arya thought a septa as large as a draft horse hovered over them and behind her two big men in crimson cloaks lannister house guards what were you doing to that cat boy myrcella asked again sternly to her brother she said hes a ragged boy isnt he look at him she giggled a ragged dirty smelly boy tommen agreed they dont know me arya realized they dont even know im a girl small wonder she was barefoot and dirty her hair tangled from the long run through the castle clad in a jerkin ripped by cat claws and brown roughspun pants hacked off above her scabby knees you dont wear skirts and silks when youre catching cats quickly she lowered her head and dropped to one knee maybe they wouldnt recognize her if they did she would never hear the end of it septa mordane would be mortified and sansa would never speak to her again from the shame the old fat septa moved forward boy how did you come here you have no business in this part of the castle you cant keep this sort out one of the red cloaks said like trying to keep out rats who do you belong to boy the septa demanded answer me whats wrong with you are you mute aryas voice caught in her throat if she answered tommen and myrcella would know her for certain godwyn bring him here the septa said the taller of the guardsmen started down the alley panic gripped her throat like a giants hand arya could not have spoken if her life had hung on it calm as still water she mouthed silently as godwyn reached for her arya moved quick as a snake she leaned to her left letting his fingers brush her arm spinning around him smooth as summer silk by the time he got himself turned she was page sprinting down the alley swift as a deer the septa was screeching at her arya slid between legs as thick and white as marble columns bounded to her feet bowled into prince tommen and hopped over him when he sat down hard and said oof spun away from the second guard and then she was past them all running full out she heard shouts then pounding footsteps closing behind her she dropped and rolled the red cloak went careening past her stumbling arya sprang back to her feet she saw a window above her high and narrow scarcely more than an arrow slit arya leapt caught the sill pulled herself up she held her breath as she wriggled through slippery as an eel dropping to the floor in front of a startled scrubwoman she hopped up brushed the rushes off her clothes and was off again out the door and along a long hall down a stair across a hidden courtyard around a corner and over a wall and through a low narrow window into a pitchdark cellar the sounds grew more and more distant behind her arya was out of breath and quite thoroughly lost she was in for it now if they had recognized her but she didnt think they had shed moved too fast swift as a deer she hunkered down in the dark against a damp stone wall and listened for the pursuit but the only sound was the beating of her own heart and a distant drip of water quiet as a shadow she told herself she wondered where she was when they had first come to kings landing she used to have bad dreams about getting lost in the castle father said the red keep was smaller than winterfell but in her dreams it had been immense an endless stone maze with walls that seemed to shift and change behind her she would find herself wandering down gloomy halls past faded tapestries descending endless circular stairs darting through courtyards or over bridges her shouts echoing unanswered in some of the rooms the red stone walls would seem to drip blood and nowhere could she find a window sometimes she would hear her fathers voice but always from a long way off and no matter how hard she ran after it it would grow fainter and fainter until it faded to nothing and arya was alone in the dark it was very dark right now she realized she hugged her bare knees tight against her chest and shivered she would wait quietly and count to ten thousand by then it would be safe for her to come creeping back out and find her way home by the time she had reached eightyseven the room had begun to lighten as her eyes adjusted to the blackness slowly the shapes around her took on form huge empty eyes stared at her hungrily through the gloom and dimly she saw the jagged shadows of long teeth she had lost the count she closed her eyes and bit her lip and sent the fear away when she looked again the monsters would be gone would never have been she pretended that syrio was beside her in the dark whispering in her ear calm as still water she told herself strong as a bear fierce as a wolverine she opened her eyes again the monsters were still there but the fear was gone arya got to her feet moving warily the heads were all around her she touched one curious wondering if it was real her fingertips brushed a massive jaw it felt real enough the bone was smooth beneath her hand cold and hard to the touch she ran her fingers down a tooth black and sharp a dagger made of darkness it made her shiver its dead she said aloud its just a skull it cant hurt me yet somehow the monster seemed to know she was there she could feel its empty eyes watching her through the gloom and there was something in page that dim cavernous room that did not love her she edged away from the skull and backed into a second larger than the first for an instant she could feel its teeth digging into her shoulder as if it wanted a bite of her flesh arya whirled felt leather catch and tear as a huge fang nipped at her jerkin and then she was running another skull loomed ahead the biggest monster of all but arya did not even slow she leapt over a ridge of black teeth as tall as swords dashed through hungry jaws and threw herself against the door her hands found a heavy iron ring set in the wood and she yanked at it the door resisted a moment before it slowly began to swing inward with a creak so loud arya was certain it could be heard all through the city she opened the door just far enough to slip through into the hallway beyond if the room with the monsters had been dark the hall was the blackest pit in the seven hells calm as still water arya told herself but even when she gave her eyes a moment to adjust there was nothing to see but the vague grey outline of the door she had come through she wiggled her fingers in front of her face felt the air move saw nothing she was blind a water dancer sees with all her senses she reminded herself she closed her eyes and steadied her breathing one two three drank in the quiet reached out with her hands her fingers brushed against rough unfinished stone to her left she followed the wall her hand skimming along the surface taking small gliding steps through the darkness all halls lead somewhere ere there is a way in there is a way out fear cuts deeper than swords arya would not be afraid it seemed as if she had been walking a long ways when the wall ended abruptly and a draft of cold air blew past her cheek loose hairs stirred faintly against her skin from somewhere far below her she heard noises the scrape of boots the distant sound of voices a flickering light brushed the wall ever so faintly and she saw that she stood at the top of a great black well a shaft twenty feet across plunging deep into the earth huge stones had been set into the curving walls as steps circling down and down dark as the steps to hell that old nan used to tell them of and something was coming up out of the darkness out of the bowels of the earth arya peered over the edge and felt the cold black breath on her face far below she saw the light of a single torch small as the flame of a candle two men she made out their shadows writhed against the sides of the well tall as giants she could hear their voices echoing up the shaft found one bastard one said the rest will come soon a day two days a fortnight and when he learns the truth what will he do a second voice asked in the liquid accents of the free cities the gods alone know the first voice said arya could see a wisp of grey smoke drifting up off the torch writhing like a snake as it rose the fools tried to kill his son and whats worse they made a mummers farce of it hes not a man to put that aside i warn you the wolf and lion will soon be at each others throats whether we will it or no too soon too soon the voice with the accent complained what good is war now we are not ready delay page as well bid me stop time do you take me for a wizard the other chuckled no less flames licked at the cold air the tall shadows were almost on top of her an instant later the man holding the torch climbed into her sight his companion beside him arya crept back away from the well dropped to her stomach and flattened herself against the wall she held her breath as the men reached the top of the steps what would you have me do asked the torchbearer a stout man in a leather half cape even in heavy boots his feet seemed to glide soundlessly over the ground a round scarred face and a stubble of dark beard showed under his steel cap and he wore mail over boiled leather and a dirk and shortsword at his belt it seemed to arya there was something oddly familiar about him if one hand can die why not a second replied the man with the accent and the forked yellow beard you have danced the dance before my friend he was no one arya had ever seen before she was certain of it grossly fat yet he seemed to walk lightly carrying his weight on the balls of his feet as a water dancer might his rings glimmered in the torchlight redgold and pale silver crusted with rubies sapphires slitted yellow tiger eyes every finger wore a ring some had two before is not now and this hand is not the other the scarred man said as they stepped out into the hall still as stone arya told herself quiet as a shadow blinded by the blaze of their own torch they did not see her pressed flat against the stone only a few feet away perhaps so the forked beard replied pausing to catch his breath after the long climb nonetheless we must have time the princess is with child the khal will not bestir himself until his son is born you know how they are these savages the man with the torch pushed at something arya heard a deep rumbling a huge slab of rock red in the torchlight slid down out of the ceiling with a resounding crash that almost made her cry out where the entry to the well had been was nothing but stone solid and unbroken if he does not bestir himself soon it may be too late the stout man in the steel cap said this is no longer a game for two players if ever it was stannis baratheon and lysa arryn have fled beyond my reach and the whispers say they are gathering swords around them the knight of flowers writes highgarden urging his lord father to send his sister to court the girl is a maid of fourteen sweet and beautiful and tractable and lord renly and ser loras intend that robert should bed her wed her and make a new queen littlefinger the gods only know what game littlefinger is playing yet lord starks the one who troubles my sleep he has the bastard he has the book and soon enough hell have the truth and now his wife has abducted tyrion lannister thanks to littlefingers meddling lord tywin will take that for an outrage and jaime has a queer affection for the imp if the lannisters move north that will bring the tullys in as well delay you say make haste i reply even the finest of jugglers cannot keep a hundred balls in the air forever you are more than a juggler old friend you are a true sorcerer all i ask is that you work your magic awhile longer they started down the hall in the direction arya had come past the room with the monsters page what i can do i will the one with the torch said softly i must have gold and another fifty birds she let them get a long way ahead then went creeping after them quiet as a shadow so many the voices were fainter as the light dwindled ahead of her the ones you need are hard to find so young to know their letters perhaps older not die so easy no the younger are safer treat them gently if they kept their tongues the risk long after their voices had faded away arya could still see the light of the torch a smoking star that bid her follow twice it seemed to disappear but she kept on straight and both times she found herself at the top of steep narrow stairs the torch glimmering far below her she hurried after it down and down once she stumbled over a rock and fell against the wall and her hand found raw earth supported by timbers whereas before the tunnel had been dressed stone she must have crept after them for miles finally they were gone but there was no place to go but forward she found the wall again and followed blind and lost pretending that nymeria was padding along beside her in the darkness at the end she was kneedeep in foulsmelling water wishing she could dance upon it as syrio might have and wondering if shed ever see light again it was full dark when finally arya emerged into the night air she found herself standing at the mouth of a sewer where it emptied into the river she stank so badly that she stripped right there dropping her soiled clothing on the riverbank as she dove into the deep black waters she swam until she felt clean and crawled out shivering some riders went past along the river road as arya was washing her clothes but if they saw the scrawny naked girl scrubbing her rags in the moonlight they took no notice she was miles from the castle but from anywhere in kings landing you needed only to look up to see the red keep high on aegons hill so there was no danger of losing her way her clothes were almost dry by the time she reached the gatehouse the portcullis was down and the gates barred so she turned aside to a postern door the gold cloaks who had the watch sneered when she told them to let her in off with you one said the kitchen scraps are gone and well have no begging after dark im not a beggar she said i live here i said off with you do you need a clout on the ear to help your hearing i want to see my father the guards exchanged a glance i want to fuck the queen myself for all the good it does me the younger one said the older scowled whos this father of yours boy the city ratcatcher the hand of the king arya told him page both men laughed but then the older one swung his fist at her casually as a man would swat a dog arya saw the blow coming even before it began she danced back out of the way untouched im not a boy she spat at them im arya stark of winterfell and if you lay a hand on me my lord father will have both your heads on spikes if you dont believe me fetch jory cassel or vayon poole from the tower of the hand she put her hands on her hips now are you going to open the gate or do you need a clout on the ear to help your hearing her father was alone in the solar when harwin and fat tom marched her in an oil lamp glowing softly at his elbow he was bent over the biggest book arya had ever seen a great thick tome with cracked yellow pages of crabbed script bound between faded leather covers but he closed it to listen to harwins report his face was stern as he sent the men away with thanks you realize i had half my guard out searching for you eddard stark said when they were alone septa mordane is beside herself with fear shes in the sept praying for your safe return arya you know you are never to go beyond the castle gates without my leave i didnt go out the gates she blurted well i didnt mean to i was down in the dungeons only they turned into this tunnel it was all dark and i didnt have a torch or a candle to see by so i had to follow i couldnt go back the way i came on account of the monsters father they were talking about killing you not the monsters the two men they didnt see me i was being still as stone and quiet as a shadow but i heard them they said you had a book and a bastard and if one hand could die why not a second is that the book jons the bastard i bet jon arya what are you talking about who said this they did she told him there was a fat one with rings and a forked yellow beard and another in mail and a steel cap and the fat one said they had to delay but the other one told him he couldnt keep juggling and the wolf and the lion were going to eat each other and it was a mummers farce she tried to remember the rest she hadnt quite understood everything shed heard and now it was all mixed up in her head the fat one said the princess was with child the one in the steel cap he had the torch he said that they had to hurry i think he was a wizard a wizard said ned unsmiling did he have a long white beard and tall pointed hat speckled with stars no it wasnt like old nans stories he didnt look like a wizard but the fat one said he was i warn you arya if youre spinning this thread of air no i told you it was in the dungeons by the place with the secret wall i was chasing cats and well she screwed up her face if she admitted knocking over prince tommen he would be really angry with her well i went in this window thats where i found the monsters monsters and wizards her father said it would seem youve had quite an adventure these men you heard you say they spoke of juggling and mummery yes arya admitted only page arya they were mummers her father told her there must be a dozen troupes in kings landing right now come to make some coin off the tourney crowds im not certain what these two were doing in the castle but perhaps the king has asked for a show no she shook her head stubbornly they werent you shouldnt be following people about and spying on them in any case nor do i cherish the notion of my daughter climbing in strange windows after stray cats look at you sweetling your arms are covered with scratches this has gone on long enough tell syrio forel that i want a word with hirn he was interrupted by a short sudden knock lord eddard pardons desmond called out opening the door a crack but theres a black brother here begging audience he says the matter is urgent i thought you would want to know my door is always open to the nights watch father said desmond ushered the man inside he was stooped and ugly with an unkempt beard and unwashed clothes yet father greeted him pleasantly and asked his name yoren as it please mord my pardons for the hour he bowed to arya and this must be your son he has your look im a girl arya said exasperated if the old man was down from the wall he must have come by way of winterfell do you know my brothers she asked excitedly robb and bran are at winterfell and jons on the wall jon snow hes in the nights watch too you must know him he has a direwolf a white one with red eyes is jon a ranger yet im arya stark the old man in his smelly black clothes was looking at her oddly but arya could not seem to stop talking when you ride back to the wall would you bring jon a letter if i wrote one she wished jon were here right now hed believe her about the dungeons and the fat man with the forked beard and the wizard in the steel cap my daughter often forgets her courtesies eddard stark said with a faint smile that softened his words i beg your forgiveness yoren did my brother benjen send you no one sent me mord saving old mormont im here to find men for the wall and when robert next holds court ill bend the knee and cry our need see if the king and his hand have some scum in the dungeons theyd be well rid of you might say as benjen stark is why were talking though his blood ran black made him my brother as much as yours its for his sake im come rode hard i did near killed my horse the way i drove her but i left the others well behind the others yoren spat sellswords and freeriders and like trash that inn was full o them and i saw them take the scent the scent of blood or the scent of gold they smell the same in the end not all o them made for kings landing either some went galloping for casterly rock and the rock lies closer lord tywin will have gotten the word by now you can count on it father frowned what word is this page yoren eyed arya one best spoken in private mord begging your pardons as you say desmond see my daughter to her chambers he kissed her on the brow well finish our talk on the morrow arya stood rooted to the spot nothing bads happened to jon has it she asked yoren or uncle benjen well as to stark i cant say the snow boy was well enough when i left the wall its not them as concerns me desmond took her hand come along milady you heard your lord father arya had no choice but to go with him wishing it had been fat tom with tom she might have been able to linger at the door on some excuse and hear what yoren was saying but desmond was too singleminded to trick how many guards does my father have she asked him as they descended to her bedchamber here at kings landing fifty you wouldnt let anyone kill him would you she asked desmond laughed no fear on that count little lady lord eddards guarded night and day hell come to no harm the lannisters have more than fifty men arya pointed out so they do but every northerner is worth ten of these southron swords so you can sleep easy what if a wizard was sent to kill him well as to that desmond replied drawing his longsword wizards die the same as other men once you cut their heads off eddard robert i beg of you ned pleaded hear what you are saying you are talking of murdering a child the whore is pregnant the kings fist slammed down on the council table loud as a thunderclap i warned you this would happen ned back in the barrowlands i warned you but you did not care to hear it well youll hear it now i want them dead mother and child both and that fool viserys as well is that plain enough for you i want them dead the other councillors were all doing their best to pretend that they were somewhere else no doubt they were wiser than he was eddard stark had seldom felt quite so alone you will dishonor yourself forever if you do this page then let it be on my head so long as it is done i am not so blind that i cannot see the shadow of the axe when it is hanging over my own neck there is no axe ned told his king only the shadow of a shadow twenty years removed if it exists at all if varys asked softly wringing powdered hands together my lord you wrong me would i bring ties to king and council ned looked at the eunuch coldly you would bring us the whisperings of a traitor half a world away my lord perhaps mormont is wrong perhaps he is lying ser jorah would not dare deceive me varys said with a sly smile rely on it my lord the princess is with child so you say if you are wrong we need not fear if the girl miscarries we need not fear if she births a daughter in place of a son we need not fear if the babe dies in infancy we need not fear but if it is a boy robert insisted if he lives the narrow sea would still lie between us i shall fear the dothraki the day they teach their horses to run on water the king took a swallow of wine and glowered at ned across the council table so you would counsel me to do nothing until the dragonspawn has landed his army on my shores is that it this dragonspawn is in his mothers belly ned said even aegon did no conquering until after he was weaned gods you are stubborn as an aurochs stark the king looked around the council table have the rest of you mislaid your tongues will no one talk sense to this frozenfaced fool varys gave the king an unctuous smile and laid a soft hand on neds sleeve i understand your qualms lord eddard truly i do it gave me no joy to bring this grievous news to council it is a terrible thing we contemplate a vile thing yet we who presume to rule must do vile things for the good of the realm howevermuch it pains us lord renly shrugged the matter seems simple enough to me we ought to have had viserys and his sister killed years ago but his grace my brother made the mistake of listening to jon arryn mercy is never a mistake lord renly ned replied on the trident ser barristan here cut down a dozen good men roberts friends and mine when they brought him to us grievously wounded and near death roose bolton urged us to cut his throat but your brother said i will not kill a man for loyalty nor for fighting well and sent his own maester to tend ser barristans wounds he gave the king a long cool look would that man were here today robert had shame enough to blush it was not the same he complained ser barristan was a knight of the kingsguard page whereas daenerys is a fourteenyearold girl ned knew he was pushing this well past the point of wisdom yet he could not keep silent robert i ask you what did we rise against aerys targaryen for if not to put an end to the murder of children to put an end to targaryens the king growled your grace i never knew you to fear rhaegar ned fought to keep the scorn out of his voice and failed have the years so unmanned you that you tremble at the shadow of an unborn child robert purpled no more ned he warned pointing not another word have you forgotten who is king here no your grace ned replied have you enough the king bellowed i am sick of talk ill be done with this or be damned what say you all she must be killed lord renly declared we have no choice murmured varys sadly sadly ser barristan selmy raised his pale blue eyes from the table and said your grace there is honor in facing an enemy on the battlefield but none in killing him in his mothers womb forgive me but i must stand with lord eddard grand maester pycelle cleared his throat a process that seemed to take some minutes my order serves the realm not the ruler once i counseled king aerys as loyally as i counsel king robert now so i bear this girl child of his no ill will yet i ask you thisshould war come again how many soldiers will die how many towns will burn how many children will be ripped from their mothers to perish on the end of a spear he stroked his luxuriant white beard infinitely sad infinitely weary is it not wiser even kinder that daenerys targaryen should die now so that tens of thousands might live kinder varys said oh well and truly spoken grand maester it is so true should the gods in their caprice grant daenerys targaryen a son the realm must bleed littlefinger was the last as ned looked to him lord petyr stifled a yawn when you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman the best thing to do is close your eyes and get on with it he declared waiting wont make the maid any prettier kiss her and be done with it kiss her ser barristan repeated aghast a steel kiss said littlefinger robert turned to face his hand well there it is ned you and selmy stand alone on this matter the only question that remains is who can we find to kill her mormont craves a royal pardon lord renly reminded them desperately varys said yet he craves life even more by now the princess nears vaes dothrak where it is death to draw a blade if i told you what the dothraki would do to the poor man who used page one on a khaleesi none of you would sleep tonight he stroked a powdered cheek now poison the tears of lys let us say khal drogo need never know it was not a natural death grand maester pycelles sleepy eyes flicked open he squinted suspiciously at the eunuch poison is a cowards weapon the king complained ned had heard enough you send hired knives to kill a fourteenyearold girl and still quibble about honor he pushed back his chair and stood do it yourself robert the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword look her in the eyes before you kill her see her tears hear her last words you owe her that much at least gods the king swore the word exploding out of him as if he could barely contain his fury you mean it damn you he reached for the flagon of wine at his elbow found it empty and flung it away to shatter against the wall i am out of wine and out of patience enough of this just have it done i will not be part of murder robert do as you will but do not ask me to fix my seal to it for a moment robert did not seem to understand what ned was saying defiance was not a dish he tasted often slowly his face changed as comprehension came his eyes narrowed and a flush crept up his neck past the velvet collar he pointed an angry finger at ned you are the kings hand lord stark you will do as i command you or ill find me a hand who will i wish him every success ned unfastened the heavy clasp that clutched at the folds of his cloak the ornate silver hand that was his badge of office he laid it on the table in front of the king saddened by the memory of the man who had pinned it on him the friend he had loved i thought you a better man than this robert i thought we had made a nobler king roberts face was purple out he croaked choking on his rage out damn you im done with you what are you waiting for go run back to winterfell and make certain i never look on your face again or i swear ill have your head on a spike ned bowed and turned on his heel without another word he could feel roberts eyes on his back as he strode from the council chambers the discussion resumed with scarcely a pause on braavos there is a society called the faceless men grand maester pycelle offered do you have any idea how costly they are littlefinger complained you could hire an army of common sellswords for half the price and thats for a merchant i dont dare think what they might ask for a princess the closing of the door behind him silenced the voices ser boros blount was stationed outside the chamber wearing the long white cloak and armor of the kingsguard he gave ned a quick curious glance from the corner of his eye but asked no questions the day felt heavy and oppressive as he crossed the bailey back to the tower of the hand he could feel the threat of rain in the air ned page would have welcomed it it might have made him feel a trifle less unclean when he reached his solar he summoned vayon poole the steward came at once you sent for me my lord hand hand no longer ned told him the king and i have quarreled we shall be returning to winterfell i shall begin making arrangements at once my lord we will need a fortnight to ready everything for the journey we may not have a fortnight we may not have a day the king mentioned something about seeing my head on a spike ned frowned he did not truly believe the king would harm him not robert he was angry now but once ned was safely out of sight his rage would cool as it always did always suddenly uncomfortably he found himself recalling rhaegar targaryen fifteen years dead yet robert hates him as much as ever it was a disturbing notion and there was the other matter the business with catelyn and the dwarf that yoren had warned him of last night that would come to light soon as sure as sunrise and with the king in such a black fury robert might not care a fig for tyrion lannister but it would touch on his pride and there was no telling what the queen might do it might be safest if i went on ahead he told poole i will take my daughters and a few guardsmen the rest of you can follow when you are ready inform jory but tell no one else and do nothing until the girls and i have gone the castle is full of eyes and ears and i would rather my plans were not known as you command my lord when he had gone eddard stark went to the window and sat brooding robert had left him no choice that he could see he ought to thank him it would be good to return to winterfell he ought never have left his sons were waiting there perhaps he and catelyn would make a new son together when he returned they were not so old yet and of late he had often found himself dreaming of snow of the deep quiet of the wolfswood at night and yet the thought of leaving angered him as well so much was still undone robert and his council of cravens and flatterers would beggar the realm if left unchecked or worse sell it to the lannisters in payment of their loans and the truth of jon arryns death still eluded him oh he had found a few pieces enough to convince him that jon had indeed been murdered but that was no more than the spoor of an animal on the forest floor he had not sighted the beast itself yet though he sensed it was there lurking hidden treacherous it struck him suddenly that he might return to winterfell by sea ned was no sailor and ordinarily would have preferred the kingsroad but if he took ship he could stop at dragonstone and speak with stannis baratheon pycelle had sent a raven off across the water with a polite letter from ned requesting lord stannis to return to his seat on the small council as yet there had been no reply but the silence only deepened his suspicions lord stannis shared the secret jon arryn had died for he was certain of it the truth he sought might very well be waiting for him on the ancient island fortress of house targaryen and when you have it what then some secrets are safer kept hidden some secrets are too dangerous to share even with those you love and trust ned slid the dagger that catelyn had brought him out of the sheath on his belt the imps knife why would the dwarf want bran dead to silence him surely page another secret or only a different strand of the same web could robert be part of it he would not have thought so but once he would not have thought robert could command the murder of women and children either catelyn had tried to warn him you knew the man she had said the king is a stranger to you the sooner he was quit of kings landing the better if there was a ship sailing north on the morrow it would be well to be on it he summoned vayon poole again and sent him to the docks to make inquiries quietly but quickly find me a fast ship with a skilled captain he told the steward i care nothing for the size of its cabins or the quality of its appointments so long as it is swift and safe i wish to leave at once poole had no sooner taken his leave than tomard announced a visitor lord baelish to see you mlord ned was halftempted to turn him away but thought better of it he was not free yet until he was he must play their games show him in tom lord petyr sauntered into the solar as if nothing had gone amiss that morning he wore a slashed velvet doublet in creamandsilver a grey silk cloak trimmed with black fox and his customary mocking smile ned greeted him coldly might i ask the reason for this visit lord baelish i wont detain you long im on my way to dine with lady tanda lamprey pie and roast suckling pig she has some thought to wed me to her younger daughter so her table is always astonishing if truth be told id sooner marry the pig but dont tell her i do love lamprey pie dont let me keep you from your eels my lord ned said with icy disdain at the moment i cannot think of anyone whose company i desire less than yours oh im certain if you put your mind to it you could come up with a few names varys say cersei or robert his grace is most wroth with you he went on about you at some length after you took your leave of us this morning the words insolence and ingratitude came into it frequently i seem to recall ned did not honor that with a reply nor did he offer his guest a seat but littlefinger took one anyway after you stormed out it was left to me to convince them not to hire the faceless men he continued blithely instead varys will quietly let it be known that well make a lord of whoever does in the targaryen girl ned was disgusted so now we grant titles to assassins littlefinger shrugged titles are cheap the faceless men are expensive if truth be told i did the targaryen girl more good than you with all your talk of honor let some sellsword drunk on visions of lordship try to kill her likely hell make a botch of it and afterward the dothraki will be on their guard if wed sent a faceless man after her shed be as good as buried ned frowned you sit in council and talk of ugly women and steel kisses and now you expect me to believe that you tried to protect the girl how big a fool do you take me for well quite an enormous one actually said littlefinger laughing page do you always find murder so amusing lord baelish its not murder i find amusing lord stark its you you rule like a man dancing on rotten ice i daresay you will make a noble splash i believe i heard the first crack this morning the first and last said ned ive had my fill when do you mean to return to winterfell my lord as soon as i can what concern is that of yours none but if perchance youre still here come evenfall id be pleased to take you to this brothel your man jory has been searching for so ineffectually littlefinger smiled and i wont even tell the lady catelyn catelyn my lady you should have sent word of your coming ser donnel waynwood told her as their horses climbed the pass we would have sent an escort the high road is not as safe as it once was for a party as small as yours we learned that to our sorrow ser donnel catelyn said sometimes she felt as though her heart had turned to stone six brave men had died to bring her this far and she could not even find it in her to weep for them even their names were fading the clansmen harried us day and night we lost three men in the first attack and two more in the second and lannisters serving man died of a fever when his wounds festered when we heard your men approaching i thought us doomed for certain they had drawn up for a last desperate fight blades in hand and backs to the rock the dwarf had been whetting the edge of his axe and making some mordant jest when bronn spotted the banner the riders carried before them the moonandfalcon of house arryn skyblue and white catelyn had never seen a more welcome sight the clans have grown bolder since lord jon died ser donnel said he was a stocky youth of twenty years earnest and homely with a wide nose and a shock of thick brown hair if it were up to me i would take a hundred men into the mountains root them out of their fastnesses and teach them some sharp lessons but your sister has forbidden it she would not even permit her knights to fight in the hands tourney she wants all our swords kept close to home to defend the vale against what no one is certain shadows some say he looked at her anxiously as if he had suddenly remembered who she was i hope i have not spoken out of turn my lady i meant no offense frank talk does not offend me ser donnel catelyn knew what her sister feared not shadows lannisters she thought to herself glancing back to where the dwarf rode beside bronn the two of them had grown thick as thieves since chiggen had died the little man was more cunning than she liked when they had entered the mountains he had been her captive bound and helpless what was he now her captive still yet he rode along with a dirk through his belt and an axe strapped to his saddle wearing the shadowskin cloak hed won dicing with the singer and the chainmail hauberk hed taken off chiggens page corpse two score men flanked the dwarf and the rest of her ragged band knights and menatarms in service to her sister lysa and jon arryns young son and yet tyrion betrayed no hint of fear could i be wrong catelyn wondered not for the first time could he be innocent after all of bran and jon arryn and all the rest and if he was what did that make her six men had died to bring him here resolute she pushed her doubts away when we reach your keep i would take it kindly if you could send for maester colemon at once ser rodrik is feverish from his wounds more than once she had feared the gallant old knight would not survive the journey toward the end he could scarcely sit his horse and bronn had urged her to leave him to his fate but catelyn would not hear of it they had tied him in the saddle instead and she had commanded marillion the singer to watch over him ser donnel hesitated before he answered the lady lysa has commanded the maester to remain at the eyrie at all times to care for lord robert he said we have a septon at the gate who tends to our wounded he can see to your mans hurts catelyn had more faith in a maesters learning than a septons prayers she was about to say as much when she saw the battlements ahead long parapets built into the very stone of the mountains on either side of them where the pass shrank to a narrow defile scarce wide enough for four men to ride abreast twin watchtowers clung to the rocky slopes joined by a covered bridge of weathered grey stone that arched above the road silent faces watched from arrow slits in tower battlements and bridge when they had climbed almost to the top a knight rode out to meet them his horse and his armor were grey but his cloak was the rippling blueandred of riverrun and a shiny black fish wrought in gold and obsidian pinned its folds against his shoulder who would pass the bloody gate he called ser donnel waynwood with the lady catelyn stark and her companions the young knight answered the knight of the gate lifted his visor i thought the lady looked familiar you are far from home little cat and you uncle she said smiling despite all she had been through hearing that hoarse smoky voice again took her back twenty years to the days of her childhood my home is at my back he said gruffly your home is in my heart catelyn told him take off your helm i would look on your face again the years have not improved it i fear brynden tully said but when he lifted off the helm catelyn saw that he lied his features were lined and weathered and time had stolen the auburn from his hair and left him only grey but the smile was the same and the bushy eyebrows fat as caterpillars and the laughter in his deep blue eyes did lysa know you were coming there was no time to send word ahead catelyn told him the others were coming up behind her i fear we ride before the storm uncle may we enter the vale ser donnel asked the waynwoods were ever ones for ceremony in the name of robert arryn lord of the eyrie defender of the vale true warden of the east i bid you enter freely and charge you to keep his peace ser brynden replied come page and so she rode behind him beneath the shadow of the bloody gate where a dozen armies had dashed themselves to pieces in the age of heroes on the far side of the stoneworks the mountains opened up suddenly upon a vista of green fields blue sky and snowcapped mountains that took her breath away the vale of arryn bathed in the morning light it stretched before them to the misty cast a tranquil land of rich black soil wide slowmoving rivers and hundreds of small lakes that shone like mirrors in the sun protected on all sides by its sheltering peaks wheat and corn and barley grew high in its fields and even in highgarden the pumpkins were no larger nor the fruit any sweeter than here they stood at the western end of the valley where the high road crested the last pass and began its winding descent to the bottomlands two miles below the vale was narrow here no more than a half days ride across and the northern mountains seemed so close that catelyn could almost reach out and touch them looming over them all was the jagged peak called the giants lance a mountain that even mountains looked up to its head lost in icy mists three and a half miles above the valley floor over its massive western shoulder flowed the ghost torrent of alyssas tears even from this distance catelyn could make out the shining silver thread bright against the dark stone when her uncle saw that she had stopped he moved his horse closer and pointed its there beside alyssas tears all you can see from here is a flash of white every now and then if you look hard and the sun hits the walls just right seven towers ned had told her like white daggers thrust into the belly of the sky so high you can stand on the parapets and look down on the clouds how long a ride she asked we can be at the mountain by evenfall uncle brynden said but the climb will take another day ser rodrik cassel spoke up from behind my lady he said i fear i can go no farther today his face sagged beneath his ragged newgrown whiskers and he looked so weary catelyn feared he might fall off his horse nor should you she said you have done all i could have asked of you and a hundred times more my uncle will see me the rest of the way to the eyrie lannister must come with me but there is no reason that you and the others should not rest here and recover your strength we should be honored to have them to guest ser donnel said with the grave courtesy of the young beside ser rodrik only bronn ser willis wode and marillion the singer remained of the party that had ridden with her from the inn by the crossroads my lady marillion said riding forward i beg you allow me to accompany you to the eyrie to see the end of the tale as i saw its beginnings the boy sounded haggard yet strangely determined he had a fevered shine to his eyes catelyn had never asked the singer to ride with them that choice he had made himself and how he had come to survive the journey when so many braver men lay dead and unburied behind them she could never say yet here he was with a scruff of beard that made him look almost a man perhaps she owed him something for having come this far very well she told him page ill come as well bronn announced she liked that less well without bronn she would never have reached the vale she knew the sellsword was as fierce a fighter as she had ever seen and his sword had helped cut them through to safety yet for all that catelyn misliked the man courage he had and strength but there was no kindness in him and little loyalty and she had seen him riding beside lannister far too often talking in low voices and laughing at some private joke she would have preferred to separate him from the dwarf here and now but having agreed that marillion might continue to the eyrie she could see no gracious way to deny that same right to bronn as you wish she said although she noted that he had not actually asked her permission ser willis wode remained with ser rodrik a softspoken septon fussing over their wounds their horses were left behind as well poor ragged things ser donnel promised to send birds ahead to the eyrie and the gates of the moon with the word of their coming fresh mounts were brought forth from the stables surefooted mountain stock with shaggy coats and within the hour they set forth once again catelyn rode beside her uncle as they began the descent to the valley floor behind came bronn tyrion lannister marillion and six of bryndens men not until they were a third of the way down the mountain path well out of earshot of the others did brynden tully turn to her and say so child tell me about this storm of yours i have not been a child in many years uncle catelyn said but she told him nonetheless it took longer than she would have believed to tell it all lysas letter and brans fall the assassins dagger and littlefinger and her chance meeting with tyrion lannister in the crossroadsinn her uncle listened silently heavy brows shadowing his eyes as his frown grew deeper brynden tully had always known how to listen to anyone but her father he was lord hosters brother younger by five years but the two of them had been at war as far back as catelyn could remember during one of their louder quarrels when catelyn was eight lord hoster had called brynden the black goat of the tully flock laughing brynden had pointed out that the sigil of their house was a leaping trout so he ought to be a black fish rather than a black goat and from that day forward he had taken it as his personal emblem the war had not ended until the day she and lysa had been wed it was at their wedding feast that brynden told his brother he was leaving riverrun to serve lysa and her new husband the lord of the eyrie lord hoster had not spoken his brothers name since from what edmure told her in his infrequent letters nonetheless during all those years of catelyns girlhood it had been brynden the blackfish to whom lord hosters children had run with their tears and their tales when father was too busy and mother too ill catelyn lysa edmure and yes even petyr baelish their fathers ward he had listened to them all patiently as he listened now laughing at their triumphs and sympathizing with their childish misfortunes when she was done her uncle remained silent for a long time as his horse negotiated the steep rocky page trail your father must be told he said at last if the lannisters should march winterfell is remote and the vale walled up behind its mountains but riverrun lies right in their path id had the same fear catelyn admitted i shall ask maester colemon to send a bird when we reach the eyrie she had other messages to send as well the commands that ned had given her for his bannermen to ready the defenses of the north what is the mood in the vale she asked angry brynden tully admitted lord jon was much loved and the insult was keenly felt when the king named jaime lannister to an office the arryns had held for near three hundred years lysa has commanded us to call her son the true warden of the east but no one is fooled nor is your sister alone in wondering at the manner of the hands death none dare say jon was murdered not openly but suspicion casts a long shadow he gave catelyn a look his mouth tight and there is the boy the boy what of him she ducked her head as they passed under a low overhang of rock and around a sharp turn her uncles voice was troubled lord robert he sighed six years old sickly and prone to weep if you take his dolls away jon arryns trueborn heir by all the gods yet there are some who say he is too weak to sit his fathers seat nestor royce has been high steward these past fourteen years while lord jon served in kings landing and many whisper that he should rule until the boy comes of age others believe that lysa must marry again and soon already the suitors gather like crows on a battlefield the eyrie is full of them i might have expected that catelyn said small wonder there lysa was still young and the kingdom of mountain and vale made a handsome wedding gift will lysa take another husband she says yes provided she finds a man who suits her brynden tully said but she has already rejected lord nestor and a dozen other suitable men she swears that this time she will choose her lord husband you of all people can scarce fault her for that ser brynden snorted nor do but it seems to me lysa is only playing at courtship she enjoys the sport but i believe your sister intends to rule herself until her boy is old enough to be lord of the eyrie in truth as well as name a woman can rule as wisely as a man catelyn said the tight woman can her uncle said with a sideways glance make no mistake cat lysa is not you he hesitated a moment if truth be told i fear you may not find your sister as helpful as you would like she was puzzled what do you mean the lysa who came back from kings landing is not the same girl who went south when her husband was named hand those years were hard for her you must know lord arryn was a dutiful husband but their marriage was made from politics not passion as was my own page they began the same but your ending has been happier than your sisters two babes stillborn twice as many miscarriages lord arryns death catelyn the gods gave lysa only the one child and he is all your sister lives for now poor boy small wonder she fled rather than see him handed over to the lannisters your sister is afraid child and the lannisters are what she fears most she ran to the vale stealing away from the red keep like a thief in the night and all to snatch her son out of the lions mouth and now you have brought the lion to her door in chains catelyn said a crevasse yawned on her right falling away into darkness she reined up her horse and picked her way along step by careful step oh her uncle glanced back to where tyrion lannister was making his slow descent behind them i see an axe on his saddle a dirk at his belt and a sellsword that trails after him like a hungry shadow where are the chains sweet one catelyn shifted uneasily in her seat the dwarf is here and not by choice chains or no he is my prisoner lysa will want him to answer for his crimes no less than it was her own lord husband the lannisters murdered and her own letter that first warned us against them brynden blackfish gave her a weary smile i hope you are right child he sighed in tones that said she was wrong the sun was well to the west by the time the slope began to flatten beneath the hooves of their horses the road widened and grew straight and for the first time catelyn noticed wildflowers and grasses growing once they reached the valley floor the going was faster and they made good time cantering through verdant greenwoods and sleepy little hamlets past orchards and golden wheat fields splashing georgl rr martin across a dozen sunlit streams her uncle sent a standardbearer ahead of them a double banner flying from his staff the moonandfalcon of house arryn on high and below it his own black fish farm wagons and merchants carts and riders from lesser houses moved aside to let them pass even so it was full dark before they reached the stout castle that stood at the foot of the giants lance torches flickered atop its ramparts and the horned moon danced upon the dark waters of its moat the drawbridge was up and the portcullis down but catelyn saw lights burning in the gatehouse and spilling from the windows of the square towers beyond the gates of the moon her uncle said as the party drew rein his standardbearer rode to the edge of the moat to hail the men in the gatehouse lord nestors seat he should be expecting us look up catelyn raised her eyes up and up and up at first all she saw was stone and trees the looming mass of the great mountain shrouded in night as black as a starless sky then she noticed the glow of distant fires well above them a tower keep built upon the steep side of the mountain its lights like orange eyes staring down from above above that was another higher and more distant and still higher a third no more than a flickering spark in the sky and finally up where the falcons soared a flash of white in the moonlight vertigo washed over her as she stared upward at the pale towers so far above the eyrie she heard marillion murmur awed the sharp voice of tyrion lannister broke in the arryns must not be overfond of company if youre page planning to make us climb that mountain in the dark id rather you kill me here well spend the night here and make the ascent on the morrow brynden told him i can scarcely wait the dwarf replied how do we get up there ive no experience at riding goats mules brynden said smiling there are steps carved into the mountain catelyn said ned had told her about them when he talked of his youth here with robert baratheon and jon arryn her uncle nodded it is too dark to see them but the steps are there too steep and narrow for horses but mules can manage them most of the way the path is guarded by three waycastles stone and snow and sky the mules will take us as far up as sky tyrion lannister glanced up doubtfully and beyond that brynden smiled beyond that the path is too steep even for mules we ascend on foot the rest of the way or perchance youd prefer to ride a basket the eyrie clings to the mountain directly above sky and in its cellars are six great winches with long iron chains to draw supplies up from below if you prefer my lord of lannister i can arrange for you to ride up with the bread and beer and apples the dwarf gave a bark of laughter would that i were a pumpkin he said alas my lord father would no doubt be most chagrined if his son of lannister went to his fate like a load of turnips if you ascend on foot i fear i must do the same we lannisters do have a certain pride pride catelyn snapped his mocking tone and easy manner made her angry arrogance some might call it arrogance and avarice and lust for power my brother is undoubtedly arrogant tyrion lannister replied my father is the soul of avarice and my sweet sister cersei lusts for power with every waking breath however am innocent as a little lamb shall i bleat for you he grinned the drawbridge came creaking down before she could reply and they heard the sound of oiled chains as the portcullis was drawn up menatarms carried burning brands out to light their way and her uncle led them across the moat lord nestor royce high steward of the vale and keeper of the gates of the moon was waiting in the yard to greet them surrounded by his knights lady stark he said bowing he was a massive barrelchested man and his bow was clumsy catelyn dismounted to stand before him lord nestor she said she knew the man only by reputation bronze yohns cousin from a lesser branch of house royce yet still a formidable lord in his own right we have had a long and tiring journey i would beg the hospitality of your roof tonight if i might my roof is yours my lady lord nestor returned gruffly but your sister the lady lysa has sent down word from the eyrie she wishes to see you at once the rest of your party will be housed here and sent up at first light page her uncle swung off his horse what madness is this he said bluntly brynden tully had never been a man to blunt the edge of his words a night ascent with the moon not even full even lysa should know thats an invitation to a broken neck the mules know the way ser brynden a wiry girl of seventeen or eighteen years stepped up beside lord nestor her dark hair was cropped short and straight around her head and she wore riding leathers and a light shirt of silvered ringmail she bowed to catelyn more gracefully than her lord i promise you my lady no harm will come to you it would be my honor to take you up ive made the dark climb a hundred times mychel says my father must have been a goat she sounded so cocky that catelyn had to smile do you have a name child mya stone if it please you my lady the girl said it did not please her it was an effort for catelyn to keep the smile on her face stone was a bastards name in the vale as snow was in the north and flowers in highgarden in each of the seven kingdoms custom had fashioned a surname for children born with no names of their own catelyn had nothing against this girl but suddenly she could not help but think of neds bastard on the wall and the thought made her angry and guilty both at once she struggled to find words for a reply lord nestor filled the silence myas a clever girl and if she vows she will bring you safely to the lady lysa i believe her she has not failed me yet then i put myself in your hands mya stone catelyn said lord nestor i charge you to keep a close guard on my prisoner and i charge you to bring the prisoner a cup of wine and a nicely crisped capon before he dies of hunger lannister said a girl would be pleasant as well but i suppose thats too much to ask of you the sellsword bronn laughed aloud lord nestor ignored the banter as you say my lady so it will be done only then did he look at the dwarf see our lord of lannister to a tower cell and bring him meat and mead catelyn took her leave of her uncle and the others as tyrion lannister was led off then followed the bastard girl through the castle two mules were waiting in the upper bailey saddled and ready mya helped her mount one while a guardsman in a skyblue cloak opened the narrow postern gate beyond was dense forest of pine and spruce and the mountain like a black wall but the steps were there chiseled deep into the rock ascending into the sky some people find it easier if they close their eyes mya said as she led the mules through the gate into the dark wood when they get frightened or dizzy sometimes they hold on to the mule too tight they dont like that i was born a tully and wed to a stark catelyn said i do not frighten easily do you plan to light a torch the steps were black as pitch the girl made a face torches just blind you on a clear night like this the moon and the stars are enough mychel says i have the eyes of the owl she mounted and urged her mule up the first step catelyns animal followed of its own accord page a gane of thrones you mentioned mychel before catelyn said the mules set the pace slow but steady she was perfectly content with that mychels my love mya explained mychel redfort hes squire to ser lyn corbray were to wed as soon as he becomes a knight next year or the year after she sounded so like sansa so happy and innocent with her dreams catelyn smiled but the smile was tinged with sadness the redforts were an old name in the vale she knew with the blood of the first men in their veins his love she might be but no redfort would ever wed a bastard his family would arrange a more suitable match for him to a corbray or a waynwood or a royce or perhaps a daughter of some greater house outside the vale if mychel redfort laid with this girl at all it would be on the wrong side of the sheet the ascent was easier than catelyn had dared hope the trees pressed close leaning over the path to make a rustling green roof that shut out even the moon so it seemed as though they were moving up a long black tunnel but the mules were surefooted and tireless and mya stone did indeed seem blessed with nighteyes they plodded upward winding their way back and forth across the face of the mountain as the steps twisted and turned a thick layer of fallen needles carpeted the path so the shoes of their mules made only the softest sound on the rock the quiet soothed her and the gentle rocking motion set catelyn to swaying in her saddle before long she was fighting sleep perhaps she did doze for a moment for suddenly a massive ironbound gate was looming before them stone mya announced cheerily dismounting iron spikes were set along the tops of formidable stone walls and two fat round towers overtopped the keep the gate swung open at myas shout inside the portly knight who commanded the waycastle greeted mya by name and offered them skewers of charred meat and onions still hot from the spit catelyn had not realized how hungry she was she ate standing in the yard as stablehands moved their saddles to fresh mules the hot juices ran down her chin and dripped onto her cloak but she was too famished to care then it was up onto a new mule and out again into the starlight the second part of the ascent seemed more treacherous to catelyn the trail was steeper the steps more worn and here and there littered with pebbles and broken stone mya had to dismount a halfdozen times to move fallen rocks from their path you dont want your mule to break a leg up here she said catelyn was forced to agree she could feel the altitude more now the trees were sparser up here and the wind blew more vigorously sharp gusts that tugged at her clothing and pushed her hair into her eyes from time to time the steps doubled back on themselves and she could see stone below them and the gates of the moon farther down its torches no brighter than candles snow was smaller than stone a single fortified tower and a timber keep and stable hidden behind a low wall of unmortared rock yet it nestled against the giants lance in such a way as to command the entire stone stair above the lower waycastle an enemy intent on the eyrie would have to fight his way from stone step by step while rocks and arrows rained down from snow above the commander an anxious young knight with a pockmarked face offered bread and cheese and the chance to warm themselves before his fire but mya declined we ought to keep going my lady she said if it please you catelyn page nodded again they were given fresh mules hers was white mya smiled when she saw him whiteys a good one my lady sure of foot even on ice but you need to be careful hell kick if he doesnt like you the white mule seemed to like catelyn there was no kicking thank the gods there was no ice either and she was grateful for that as well my mother says that hundreds of years ago this was where the snow began mya told her it was always white above here and the ice never melted she shrugged i cant remember ever seeing snow this far down the mountain but maybe it was that way once in the olden times so young catelyn thought trying to remember if she had ever been like that the girl had lived half her life in summer and that was all she knew winter is coming child she wanted to tell her the words were on her lips she almost said them perhaps she was becoming a stark at last above snow the wind was a living thing howling around them like a wolf in the waste then falling off to nothing as if to lure them into complacency the stars seemed brighter up here so close that she could almost touch them and the horned moon was huge in the clear black sky as they climbed catelyn found it was better to look up than down the steps were cracked and broken from centuries of freeze and thaw and the tread of countless mules and even in the dark the heights put her heart in her throat when they came to a high saddle between two spires of rock mya dismounted its best to lead the mules over she said the wind can be a little scary here my lady catelyn climbed stiffly from the shadows and looked at the path ahead twenty feet long and close to three feet wide but with a precipitous drop to either side she could hear the wind shrieking mya stepped lightly out her mule following as calmly as if they were crossing a bailey it was her turn yet no sooner had she taken her first step than fear caught catelyn in its jaws she could feel the emptiness the vast black gulfs of air that yawned around her she stopped trembling afraid to move the wind screamed at her and wrenched at her cloak trying to pull her over the edge catelyn edged her foot backward the most timid of steps but the mule was behind her and she could not retreat i am going to die here she thought she could feel cold sweat trickling down her back lady stark mya called across the gulf the girl sounded a thousand leagues away are you well catelyn tully stark swallowed what remained of her pride i i cannot do this child she called out yes you can the bastard girl said i know you can look how wide the path is i dont want to look the world seemed to be spinning around her mountain and sky and mules whirling like a childs top catelyn closed her eyes to steady her ragged breathing ill come back for you mya said dont move my lady moving was about the last thing catelyn was about to do she listened to the skirling of the wind and the scuffling sound of leather on stone then mya was there taking her gently by the arm keep your eyes closed if you like let go of the rope now whitey will take care of himself very good my lady ill lead you over its easy youll see give me a step now thats it move your foot just slide it forward see page now another easy you could run across another one go on yes and so foot by foot step by step the bastard girl led catelyn across blind and trembling while the white mule followed placidly behind them the waycastle called sky was no more than a high crescentshaped wall of unmortared stone raised against the side of the mountain but even the topless towers of valyria could not have looked more beautiful to catelyn stark here at last the snow crown began skys weathered stones were rimed with frost and long spears of ice hung from the slopes above dawn was breaking in the east as mya stone hallooed for the guards and the gates opened before them inside the walls there was only a series of ramps and a great tumble of boulders and stones of all sizes no doubt it would be the easiest thing in the world to begin an avalanche from here a mouth yawned in the rock face in front of them the stables and barracks are in there mya said the last part is inside the mountain it can be a little dark but at least youre out of the wind this is as far as the mules can go past here well its a sort of chimney more like a stone ladder than proper steps but its not too bad another hour and well be there catelyn looked up directly overhead pale in the dawn light she could see the foundations of the eyrie it could not be more than six hundred feet above them from below it looked like a small white honeycomb she remembered what her uncle had said of baskets and winches the lannisters may have their pride she told mya but the tullys are born with better sense i have ridden all day and the best part of a night tell them to lower a basket i shall ride with the turnips the sun was well above the mountains by the time catelyn stark finally reached the eyrie a stocky silverhaired man in a skyblue cloak and hammered moonandfalcon breastplate helped her from the basket ser vardis egen captain of jon arryns household guard beside him stood maester colemon thin and nervous with too little hair and too much neck lady stark ser vardis said the pleasure is as great as it is unanticipated maester colemon bobbed his head in agreement indeed it is my lady indeed it is i have sent word to your sister she left orders to be awakened the instant you arrived i hope she had a good nights rest catelyn said with a certain bite in her tone that seemed to go unnoticed the men escorted her from the winch room up a spiral stair the eyrie was a small castle by the standards of the great houses seven slender white towers bunched as tightly as arrows in a quiver on a shoulder of the great mountain it had no need of stables nor smithys nor kennels but ned said its granary was as large as winterfells and its towers could house five hundred men yet it seemed strangely deserted to catelyn as she passed through it its pale stone halls echoing and empty lysa was waiting alone in her solar still clad in her bed robes her long auburn hair tumbled unbound across bare white shoulders and down her back a maid stood behind her brushing out the nights tangles but when catelyn entered her sister rose to her feet smiling cat she said oh cat how good it is to see you my sweet sister she ran across the chamber and wrapped her sister in her arms how long it has been lysa murmured against her oh how very very long it had been five years in truth five cruel years for lysa they had taken their toll her sister was two years the younger yet she looked older now shorter than catelyn lysa had grown thick of body pale page and puffy of face she had the blue eyes of the tullys but hers were pale and watery never still her small mouth had turned petulant as catelyn held her she remembered the slender highbreasted girl whod waited beside her that day in the sept at riverrun how lovely and full of hope she had been all that remained of her sisters beauty was the great fall of thick auburn hair that cascaded to her waist you look well catelyn lied but tired her sister broke the embrace tired yes oh yes she seemed to notice the others then her maid maester colemon ser vardis leave us she told them i wish to speak to my sister alone she held catelyns hand as they withdrew and dropped it the instant the door closed catelyn saw her face change it was as if the sun had gone behind a cloud have you taken leave of your senses lysa snapped at her to bring him here without a word of permission without so much as a warning to drag us into your quarrels with the lannisters my quarrels catelyn could scarce believe what she was hearing a great fire burned in the hearth but there was no trace of warmth in lysas voice they were your quarrels first sister it was you who sent me that cursed letter you who wrote that the lannisters had murdered your husband to warn you so you could stay away from them i never meant to fight them gods cat do you know what youve done mother a small voice said lysa whirled her heavy robe swirling around her robert arryn lord of the eyrie stood in the doorway clutching a ragged cloth doll and looking at them with large eyes he was a painfully thin child small for his age and sickly all his days and from time to time he trembled the shaking sickness the maesters called it i heard voices small wonder catelyn thought lysa had almost been shouting still her sister looked daggers at her this is your aunt catelyn baby my sister lady stark do you remember the boy glanced at her blankly i think so he said blinking though he had been less than a year old the last time catelyn had seen him lysa seated herself near the fire and said come to mother my sweet one she straightened his bedclothes and fussed with his fine brown hair isnt he beautiful and strong too dont you believe the things you hear jon knew the seed is strong he told me his last words he kept saying roberts name and he grabbed my arm so hard he left marks tell them the seed is strong his seed he wanted everyone to know what a good strong boy my baby was going to be lysa catelyn said if youre right about the lannisters all the more reason we must act quickly we not in front of the baby lysa said he has a delicate temper dont you sweet one the boy is lord of the eyrie and defender of the vale catelyn reminded her and these are no times page for delicacy ned thinks it may come to war quiet lysa snapped at her youre scaring the boy little robert took a quick peek over his shoulder at catelyn and began to tremble his doll fell to the rushes and he pressed himself against his mother dont be afraid my sweet baby lysa whispered mothers here nothing will hurt you she opened her robe and drew out a pale heavy breast tipped with red the boy grabbed for it eagerly buried his face against her chest and began to suck lysa stroked his hair catelyn was at a loss for words jon anyns son she thought incredulously she remembered her own baby threeyearold rickon half the age of this boy and five times as fierce small wonder the lords of the vale were restive for the first time she understood why the king had tried to take the child away from his mother to foster with the lannisters were safe here lysa was saying whether to her or to the boy catelyn was not sure dont be a fool catelyn said the anger rising in her no one is safe if you think hiding here will make the lannisters forget you you are sadly mistaken lysa covered her boys ear with her hand even if they could bring an army through the mountains and past the bloody gate the eyrie is impregnable you saw for yourself no enemy could ever reach us up here catelyn wanted to slap her uncle brynden had tried to warn her she realized no castle is impregnable this one is lysa insisted everyone says so the only thing is what am i to do with this imp you have brought me is he a bad man the lord of the eyrie asked his mothers breast popping from his mouth the nipple wet and red a very bad man lysa told him as she covered herself but mother wont let him harm my little baby make him fly robert said eagerly lysa stroked her sons hair perhaps we will she murmured perhaps that is just what we will do eddard he found littlefinger in the brothels common room chatting amiably with a tall elegant woman who wore a feathered gown over skin as black as ink by the hearth heward and a buxom wench were playing at forfeits from the look of it hed lost his belt his cloak his mail shirt and his right boot so far while the girl had been forced to unbutton her shift to the waist jory cassel stood beside a rainstreaked window with a wry smile on his face watching heward turn over tiles and enjoying the view page ned paused at the foot of the stair and pulled on his gloves its time we took our leave my business here is done heward lurched to his feet hurriedly gathering up his things as you will my lord jory said ill help wyl bring round the horses he strode to the door littlefinger took his time saying his farewells he kissed the black womans hand whispered some joke that made her laugh aloud and sauntered over to ned your business he said lightly or roberts they say the hand dreams the kings dreams speaks with the kings voice and rules with the kings sword does that also mean you fuck with the kings lord baelish ned interrupted you presume too much i am not ungrateful for your help it might have taken us years to find this brothel without you that does not mean i intend to endure your mockery and i am no longer the kings hand the direwolf must be a prickly beast said littlefinger with a sharp twist of his mouth a warm rain was pelting down from a starless black sky as they walked to the stables ned drew up the hood of his cloak jory brought out his horse young wyl came right behind him leading littlefingers mare with one hand while the other fumbled with his belt and the lacings of his trousers a barefoot whore leaned out of the stable door giggling at him will we be going back to the castle now my lord jory asked ned nodded and swung into the saddle littlefinger mounted up beside him jory and the others followed chataya runs a choice establishment littlefinger said as they rode ive half a mind to buy it brothels are a much sounder investment than ships ive found whores seldom sink and when they are boarded by pirates why the pirates pay good coin like everyone else lord petyr chuckled at his own wit ned let him prattle on after a time he quieted and they rode in silence the streets of kings landing were dark and deserted the rain had driven everyone under their roofs it beat down on neds head warm as blood and relentless as old guilts fat drops of water ran down his face robert will never keep to one bed lyanna had told him at winterfell on the night long ago when their father had promised her hand to the young lord of storms end i hear he has gotten a child on some girl in the vale ned had held the babe in his arms he could scarcely deny her nor would he lie to his sister but he had assured her that what robert did before their betrothal was of no matter that he was a good man and true who would love her with all his heart lyanna had only smiled love is sweet dearest ned but it cannot change a mans nature the girl had been so young ned had not dared to ask her age no doubt shed been a virgin the better brothels could always find a virgin if the purse was fat enough she had light red hair and a powdering of freckles across the bridge of her nose and when she slipped free a breast to give her nipple to the babe he saw that her bosom was freckled as well i named her barra she said as the child nursed she looks so like him does she not milord she has his nose and his hair she does eddard stark had touched the babys fine dark hair it page flowed through his fingers like black silk roberts firstborn had had the same fine hair he seemed to recall tell him that when you see him milord as it as it please you tell him how beautiful she is i will ned had promised her that was his curse robert would swear undying love and forget them before evenfall but ned stark kept his vows he thought of the promises hed made lyanna as she lay dying and the price hed paid to keep them and tell him ive not been with no one else i swear it milord by the old gods and new chataya said i could have half a year for the baby and for hoping hed come back so youll tell him im waiting wont you i dont want no jewels or nothing just him he was always good to me truly good to you ned thought hollowly i will tell him child and i promise you barra shall not go wanting she had smiled then a smile so tremulous and sweet that it cut the heart out of him riding through the rainy night ned saw jon snows face in front of him so like a younger version of his own if the gods frowned so on bastards he thought dully why did they fill men with such lusts lord baelish what do you know of roberts bastards well he has more than you for a start how many littlefinger shrugged rivulets of moisture twisted down the back of his cloak does it matter if you bed enough women some will give you presents and his grace has never been shy on that count i know hes acknowledged that boy at storms end the one he fathered the night lord stannis wed he could hardly do otherwise the mother was a florent niece to the lady selyse one of her bedmaids renly says that robert carried the girl upstairs during the feast and broke in the wedding bed while stannis and his bride were still dancing lord stannis seemed to think that was a blot on the honor of his wifes house so when the boy was born he shipped him off to renly he gave ned a sideways glance ive also heard whispers that robert got a pair of twins on a serving wench at casterly rock three years ago when he went west for lord tywins tourney cersei had the babes killed and sold the mother to a passing slaver too much an affront to lannister pride that close to home ned stark grimaced ugly tales like that were told of every great lord in the realm he could believe it of cersei lannister readily enough but would the king stand by and let it happen the robert he had known would not have but the robert he had known had never been so practiced at shutting his eyes to things he did not wish to see why would jon arryn take a sudden interest in the kings baseborn children the short man gave a sodden shrug he was the kings hand doubtless robert asked him to see that they were provided for page ned was soaked through to the bone and his soul had grown cold it had to be more than that or why kill him littlefinger shook the rain from his hair and laughed now i see lord arryn learned that his grace had filled the bellies of some whores and fishwives and for that he had to be silenced small wonder allow a man like that to live and next hes like to blurt out that the sun rises in the east there was no answer ned stark could give to that but a frown for the first time in years he found himself remembering rhaegar targaryen he wondered if rhaegar had frequented brothels somehow he thought not the rain was falling harder now stinging the eyes and drumming against the ground rivers of black water were running down the hill when jory called out my lord his voice hoarse with alarm and in an instant the street was full of soldiers ned glimpsed ringmail over leather gauntlets and greaves steel helms with golden lions on the crests their cloaks clung to their backs sodden with rain he had no time to count but there were ten at least a line of them on foot blocking the street with longswords and irontipped spears behind he heard wyl cry and when he turned his horse there were more in back of them cutting off their retreat jorys sword came singing from its scabbard make way or die the wolves are howling their leader said ned could see rain running down his face such a small pack though littlefinger walked his horse forward step by careful step what is the meaning of this this is the hand of the king he was the hand of the king the mud muffled the hooves of the blood bay stallion the line parted before him on a golden breastplate the lion of lannister roared its defiance now if truth be told im not sure what he is lannister this is madness littlefinger said let us pass we are expected back at the castle what do you think youre doing he knows what hes doing ned said calmly jaime lannister smiled quite true im looking for my brother you remember my brother dont you lord stark he was with us at winterfell fairhaired mismatched eyes sharp of tongue a short man i remember him well ned replied it would seem he has met some trouble on the road my lord father is quite vexed you would not perchance have any notion of who might have wished my brother ill would you your brother has been taken at my command to answer for his crimes ned stark said littlefinger groaned in dismay my lords ser jaime ripped his longsword from its sheath and urged his stallion forward show me your steel page lord eddard ill butcher you like aerys if i must but id sooner you died with a blade in your hand he gave littlefinger a cool contemptuous glance lord baelish id leave here in some haste if i did not care to get bloodstains on my costly clothing littlefinger did not need to be urged i will bring the city watch he promised ned the lannister line parted to let him through and closed behind him littlefinger put his heels to his mare and vanished around a corner neds men had drawn their swords but they were three against twenty eyes watched from nearby windows and doors but no one was about to intervene his party was mounted the lannisters on foot save for jaime himself a charge might win them free but it seemed to eddard stark that they had a surer safer tactic kill me he warned the kingslayer and catelyn will most certainly slay tyrion jaime lannister poked at neds chest with the gilded sword that had sipped the blood of the last of the dragonkings would she the noble catelyn tully of riverrun murder a hostage i think not he sighed but i am not willing to chance my brothers life on a womans honor jaime slid the golden sword into its sheath so i suppose ill let you run back to robert to tell him how i frightened you i wonder if hell care jaime pushed his wet hair back with his fingers and wheeled his horse around when he was beyond the line of swordsmen he glanced back at his captain tregar see that no harm comes to lord stark as you say mlord still we wouldnt want him to leave here entirely unchastened sothrough the night and the rain he glimpsed the white of jaimes smilekill his men no ned stark screamed clawing for his sword jaime was already cantering off down the street as he heard wyl shout men closed from both sides ned rode one down cutting at phantoms in red cloaks who gave way before him jory cassel put his heels into his mount and charged a steelshod hoof caught a lannister guardsman in the face with a sickening crunch a second man reeled away and for an instant jory was free wyl cursed as they pulled him off his dying horse swords slashing in the rain ned galloped to him bringing his longsword down on tregars helm the jolt of impact made him grit his teeth tregar stumbled to his knees his lion crest sheared in half blood running down his face heward was hacking at the hands that had seized his bridle when a spear caught him in the belly suddenly jory was back among them a red rain flying from his sword no ned shouted jory away neds horse slipped under him and came crashing down in the mud there was a moment of blinding pain and the taste of blood in his mouth he saw them cut the legs from jorys mount and drag him to the earth swords rising and failing as they closed in around him when neds horse lurched back to its feet he tried to rise only to fall again choking on his scream he could see the splintered bone poking through his calf it was the last thing he saw for a time the rain came down and down and down when he opened his eyes again lord eddard stark was alone with his dead his horse moved closer caught the rank scent of blood and galloped away ned began to drag himself through the mud gritting his teeth at the agony in his leg it seemed to take years faces watched from candlelit windows and people began to emerge from alleys and doors but no one moved to help page littlefinger and the city watch found him there in the street cradling jory cassels body in his arms somewhere the gold cloaks found a litter but the trip back to the castle was a blur of agony and ned lost consciousness more than once he remembered seeing the red keep looming ahead of him in the first grey light of dawn the rain had darkened the pale pink stone of the massive walls to the color of blood then grand maester pycelle was looming over him holding a cup whispering drink my lord here the milk of the poppy for your pain he remembered swallowing and pycelle was telling someone to heat the wine to boiling and fetch him clean silk and that was the last he knew daenerys the horse gate of vaes dothrak was made of two gigantic bronze stallions rearing their hooves meeting a hundred feet above the roadway to form a pointed arch dany could not have said why the city needed a gate when it had no walls and no buildings that she could see yet there it stood immense and beautiful the great horses framing the distant purple mountain beyond the bronze stallions threw long shadows across the waving grasses as khal drogo led the khalasar under their hooves and down the godsway his bloodriders beside him dany followed on her silver escorted by ser jorah mormont and her brother viserys mounted once more after the day in the grass when she had left him to walk back to the khalasar the dothraki had laughingly called him khal rhae mhar the sorefoot king khal drogo had offered him a place in a cart the next day and viserys had accepted in his stubborn ignorance he had not even known he was being mocked the carts were for eunuchs cripples women giving birth the very young and the very old that won him yet another name khal rhaggat the cart king her brother had thought it was the khals way of apologizing for the wrong dany had done him she had begged ser jorah not to tell him the truth lest he be shamed the knight had replied that the king could well do with a bit of shame yet he had done as she bid it had taken much pleading and all the pillow tricks doreah had taught her before dany had been able to make drogo relent and allow viserys to rejoin them at the head of the column where is the city she asked as they passed beneath the bronze arch there were no buildings to be seen no people only the grass and the road lined with ancient monuments from all the lands the dothraki had sacked over the centuries ahead ser jorah answered under the mountain beyond the horse gate plundered gods and stolen heroes loomed to either side of them the forgotten deities of dead cities brandished their broken thunderbolts at the sky as dany rode her silver past their feet stone kings looked down on her from their thrones their faces chipped and stained even their names lost in the mists of time lithe young maidens danced on marble plinths draped only in flowers or poured air from shattered jars monsters stood in the grass beside the road black iron dragons with jewels for eyes roaring griffins manticores with their barbed tails poised to strike and other beasts she page could not name some of the statues were so lovely they took her breath away others so misshapen and terrible that dany could scarcely bear to look at them those ser jorah said had likely come from the shadow lands beyond asshai so many she said as her silver stepped slowly onward and from so many lands viserys was less impressed the trash of dead cities he sneered he was careful to speak in the common tongue which few dothraki could understand yet even so dany found herself glancing back at the men of her khas to make certain he had not been overheard he went on blithely all these savages know how to do is steal the things better men have built and kill he laughed they do know how to kill otherwise id have no use for them at all they are my people now dany said you should not call them savages brother the dragon speaks as he likes viserys said in the common tongue he glanced over his shoulder at aggo and rakharo riding behind them and favored them with a mocking smile see the savages lack the wit to understand the speech of civilized men a mosseaten stone monolith loomed over the road fifty feet tall viserys gazed at it with boredom in his eyes how long must we linger amidst these ruins before drogo gives me my army i grow tired of waiting the princess must be presented to the dosh khaleen the crones yes her brother interrupted and theres to be some mummers show of a prophecy for the whelp in her belly you told me what is that to me im tired of eating horsemeat and im sick of the stink of these savages he sniffed at the wide floppy sleeve of his tunic where it was his custom to keep a sachet it could not have helped much the tunic was filthy all the silk and heavy wools that viserys had worn out of pentos were stained by hard travel and rotted from sweat ser jorah mormont said the western market will have food more to your taste your grace the traders from the free cities come there to sell their wares the khal will honor his promise in his own time he had better viserys said grimly i was promised a crown and i mean to have it the dragon is not mocked spying an obscene likeness of a woman with six breasts and a ferrets head he rode off to inspect it more closely dany was relieved yet no less anxious i pray that my sunandstars will not keep him waiting too long she told ser jorah when her brother was out of earshot the knight looked after viserys doubtfully your brother should have bided his time in pentos there is no place for him in a khalasar illyrio tried to warn him he will go as soon as he has his ten thousand my lord husband promised a golden crown ser jorah grunted yes khaleesi but the dothraki look on these things differently than we do in the west i have told him as much as illyrio told him but your brother does not listen the horselords are no traders viserys thinks he sold you and now he wants his price yet khal drogo would say he had you page as a gift he will give viserys a gift in return yes in his own time you do not demand a gift not of a khal you do not demand anything of a khal it is not right to make him wait dany did not know why she was defending her brother yet she was viserys says he could sweep the seven kingdoms with ten thousand dothraki screamers ser jorah snorted viserys could not sweep a stable with ten thousand brooms dany could not pretend to surprise at the disdain in his tone what what if it were not viserys she asked if it were someone else who led them someone stronger could the dothraki truly conquer the seven kingdoms ser jorahs face grew thoughtful as their horses trod together down the godsway when i first went into exile i looked at the dothraki and saw halfnaked barbarians as wild as their horses if you had asked me then princess i should have told you that a thousand good knights would have no trouble putting to flight a hundred times as many dothraki but if i asked you now now the knight said i am less certain they are better riders than any knight utterly fearless and their bows outrange ours in the seven kingdoms most archers fight on foot from behind a shieldwall or a barricade of sharpened stakes the dothraki fire from horseback charging or retreating it makes no matter they are full as deadly and there are so many of them my lady your lord husband alone counts forty thousand mounted warriors in his khalasar is that truly so many your brother rhaegar brought as many men to the trident ser jorah admitted but of that number no more than a tenth were knights the rest were archers freeriders and foot soldiers armed with spears and pikes when rhaegar fell many threw down their weapons and fled the field how long do you imagine such a rabble would stand against the charge of forty thousand screamers howling for blood how well would boiled leather jerkins and mailed shirts protect them when the arrows fall like rain not long she said not well he nodded mind you princess if the lords of the seven kingdoms have the wit the gods gave a goose it will never come to that the riders have no taste for siegecraft i doubt they could take even the weakest castle in the seven kingdoms but if robert baratheon were fool enough to give them battle is he dany asked a fool i mean ser jorah considered that for a moment robert should have been born dothraki he said at last your khal would tell you that only a coward hides behind stone walls instead of facing his enemy with a blade in hand the usurper would agree he is a strong man brave and rash enough to meet a dothraki horde in the open field but the men around him well their pipers play a different tune his brother stannis lord tywin lannister eddard stark he spat page you hate this lord stark dany said he took from me all i loved for the sake of a few liceridden poachers and his precious honor ser jorah said bitterly from his tone she could tell the loss still pained him he changed the subject quickly there he announced pointing vaes dothrak the city of the horselords khal drogo and his bloodriders led them through the great bazaar of the western market down the broad ways beyond dany followed close on her silver staring at the strangeness about her vaes dothrak was at once the largest city and the smallest that she had ever known she tho ught it must be ten times as large as pentos a vastness without walls or limits its broad windswept streets paved in grass and mud and carpeted with wildflowers in the free cities of the west towers and manses and hovels and bridges and shops and halls all crowded in on one another but vaes dothrak sprawled languorously baking in the warm sun ancient arrogant and empty even the buildings were so queer to her eyes she saw carved stone pavilions manses of woven grass as large as castles rickety wooden towers stepped pyramids faced with marble log halls open to the sky in place of walls some palaces were surrounded by thorny hedges none of them are alike she said your brother had part of the truth ser jorah admitted the dothraki do not build a thousand years ago to make a house they would dig a hole in the earth and cover it with a woven grass roof the buildings you see were made by slaves brought here from lands theyve plundered and they built each after the fashion of their own peoples most of the halls even the largest seemed deserted where are the people who live here dany asked the bazaar had been full of running children and men shouting but elsewhere she had seen only a few eunuchs going about their business only the crones of the dosh khaleen dwell permanently in the sacred city them and their slaves and servants ser jorah replied yet vaes dothrak is large enough to house every man of every khalasar should all the khals return to the mother at once the crones have prophesied that one day that will come to pass and so vaes dothrak must be ready to embrace all its children khal drogo finally called a halt near the eastern market where the caravans from yi ti and asshai and the shadow lands came to trade with the mother of mountains looming overhead dany smiled as she recalled magister illyrios slave girl and her talk of a palace with two hundred rooms and doors of solid silver the palace was a cavernous wooden feasting hall its roughhewn timbered walls rising forty feet its roof sewn silk a vast billowing tent that could be raised to keep out the rare rains or lowered to admit the endless sky around the hall were broad grassy horse yards fenced with high hedges firepits and hundreds of round earthen houses that bulged from the ground like miniature hills covered with grass a small army of slaves had gone ahead to prepare for khal drogos arrival as each rider swung down from his saddle he unbelted his arakh and handed it to a waiting slave and any other weapons he carried as well even khal drogo himself was not exempt ser jorah george rr marun page had explained that it was forbidden to carry a blade in vaes dothrak or to shed a free mans blood even warring khalasars put aside their feuds and shared meat and mead together when they were in sight of the mother of mountains in this place the crones of the dosh khaleen had decreed all dothraki were one blood one khalasar one herd cohollo came to dany as irri and jhiqui were helping her down off her silver he was the oldest of drogos three bloodriders a squat bald man with a crooked nose and a mouth full of broken teeth shattered by a mace twenty years before when he saved the young khalakka from sellswords who hoped to sell him to his fathers enemies his life had been bound to drogos the day her lord husband was born every khal had his bloodriders at first dany had thought of them as a kind of dothraki kingsguard sworn to protect their lord but it went further than that jhiqui had taught her that a bloodrider was more than a guard they were the khals brothers his shadows his fiercest friends blood of my blood drogo called them and so it was they shared a single life the ancient traditions of the horselords demanded that when the khal died his bloodriders died with him to ride at his side in the night lands if the khal died at the hands of some enemy they lived only long enough to avenge him and then followed him joyfully into the grave in some khalasars jhiqui said the bloodriders shared the khals wine his tent and even his wives though never his horses a mans mount was his own daenerys was glad that khal drogo did not hold to those ancient ways she should not have liked being shared and while old cohollo treated her kindly enough the others frightened her haggo huge and silent often glowered as if he had forgotten who she was and qotho had cruel eyes and quick hands that liked to hurt he left bruises on doreahs soft white skin whenever he touched her and sometimes made irri sob in the night even his horses seemed to fear him yet they were bound to drogo for life and death so daenerys had no choice but to accept them and sometimes she found herself wishing her father had been protected by such men in the songs the white knights of the kingsguard were ever noble valiant and true and yet king aerys had been murdered by one of them the handsome boy they now called the kingslayer and a second ser barristan the bold had gone over to the usurper she wondered if all men were as false in the seven kingdoms when her son sat the iron throne she would see that he had bloodriders of his own to protect him against treachery in his kingsguard khaleesi cohollo said to her in dothraki drogo who is blood of my blood commands me to tell you that he must ascend the mother of mountains this night to sacrifice to the gods for his safe return only men were allowed to set foot on the mother dany knew the khals bloodriders would go with him and return at dawn tell my sunandstars that i dream of him and wait anxious for his return she replied thankful dany tired more easily as the child grew within her in truth a night of rest would be most welcome her pregnancy only seemed to have inflamed drogos desire for her and of late his embraces left her exhausted doreah led her to the hollow hill that had been prepared for her and her khal it was cool and dim within like a tent made of earth jhiqui a bath please she commanded to wash the dust of travel from her skin and soak her weary bones it was pleasant to know that they would linger here for a while that she would not need to climb back on her silver on the morrow page the water was scalding hot as she liked it i will give my brother his gifts tonight she decided as jhiqui was washing her hair he should look a king in the sacred city doreah run and find him and invite him to sup with me viserys was nicer to the lysene girl than to her dothraki handmaids perhaps because magister illyrio had let him bed her back in pentos irri go to the bazaar and buy fruit and meat anything but horseflesh horse is best irri said horse makes a man strong viserys hates horsemeat as you say khaleesi she brought back a haunch of goat and a basket of fruits and vegetables jhiqui roasted the meat with sweetgrass and firepods basting it with honey as it cooked and there were melons and pomegranates and plums and some queer eastern fruit dany did not know while her handmaids prepared the meal dany laid out the clothing shed had made to her brothers measure a tunic and leggings of crisp white linen leather sandals that laced up to the knee a bronze medallion belt a leather vest painted with firebreathing dragons the dothraki would respect him more if he looked less a beggar she hoped and perhaps he would forgive her for shaming him that day in the grass he was still her king after all and her brother they were both blood of the dragon she was arranging the last of his giftsa sandsilk cloak green as grass with a pale grey border that would bring out the silver in his hairwhen viserys arrived dragging doreah by the arm her eye was red where hed hit her how dare you send this whore to give me commands he said he shoved the handmaid roughly to the carpet the anger took dany utterly by surprise i only wanted doreah what did you say khaleesi pardons forgive me i went to him as you bid and told him you commanded him to join you for supper no one commands the dragon viserys snarled i am your king i should have sent you back her head the lysene girl quailed but dany calmed her with a touch dont be afraid he wont hurt you sweet brother please forgive her the girl misspoke herself i told her to ask you to sup with me if it pleases your grace she took him by the hand and drew him across the room look these are for you viserys frowned suspiciously what is all this new raiment i had it made for you dany smiled shyly he looked at her and sneered dothraki rags do you presume to dress me now please youll be cooler and more comfortable and i thought maybe if you dressed like them the dothraki dany did not know how to say it without waking his dragon next youll want to braid my hair page id never why was he always so cruel she had only wanted to help you have no right to a braid you have won no victories yet it was the wrong thing to say fury shone from his lilac eyes yet he dared not strike her not with her handmaids watching and the warriors of her khas outside viserys picked up the cloak and sniffed at it this stinks of manure perhaps i shall use it as a horse blanket i had doreah sew it specially for you she told him wounded these are garments fit for a khal i am the lord of the seven kingdoms not some grassstained savage with bells in his hair viserys spat back at her he grabbed her arm you forget yourself slut do you think that big belly will protect you if you wake the dragon his fingers dug into her arm painfully and for an instant dany felt like a child again quailing in the face of his rage she reached out with her other hand and grabbed the first thing she touched the belt shed hoped to give him a heavy chain of ornate bronze medallions she swung it with all her strength it caught him full in the face viserys let go of her blood ran down his cheek where the edge of one of the medallions had sliced it open you are the one who forgets himself dany said to him didnt you learn anything that day in the grass leave me now before i summon my khas to drag you out and pray that khal drogo does not hear of this or he will cut open your belly and feed you your own entrails viserys scrambled back to his feet when i come into my kingdom you will rue this day slut he walked off holding his torn face leaving her gifts behind him drops of his blood had spattered the beautiful sandsilk cloak dany clutched the soft cloth to her cheek and sat crosslegged on her sleeping mats your supper is ready khaleesi jhiqui announced im not hungry dany said sadly she was suddenly very tired share the food among yourselves and send some to ser jorah if you would after a moment she added please bring me one of the dragons eggs irri fetched the egg with the deep green shell bronze flecks shining amid its scales as she turned it in her small hands dany curled up on her side pulling the sandsilk cloak across her and cradling the egg in the hollow between her swollen belly and small tender breasts she liked to hold them they were so beautiful and sometimes just being close to them made her feel stronger braver as if somehow she were drawing strength from the stone dragons locked inside she was lying there holding the egg when she felt the child move within her as if he were reaching out brother to brother blood to blood you are the dragon dany whispered to him the true dragon i know it i know it and she smiled and went to sleep dreaming of home bran a light snow was falling bran could feel the flakes on his face melting as they touched his skin like the page gentlest of rains he sat straight atop his horse watching as the iron portcullis was winched upward try as he might to keep calm his heart was fluttering in his chest are you ready robb asked bran nodded trying not to let his fear show he had not been outside winterfell since his fall but he was determined to ride out as proud as any knight lets ride then robb put his heels into his big greyandwhite gelding and the horse walked under the portcullis go bran whispered to his own horse he touched her neck lightly and the small chestnut filly started forward bran had named her dancer she was two years old and joseth said she was smarter than any horse had a right to be they had trained her special to respond to rein and voice and touch up to now bran had only ridden her around the yard at first joseth or hodor would lead her while bran sat strapped to her back in the oversize saddle the imp had drawn up for him but for the past fortnight he had been riding her on his own trotting her round and round and growing bolder with every circuit they passed beneath the gatehouse over the drawbridge through the outer walls summer and grey wind came loping beside them sniffing at the wind close behind came theon greyjoy with his longbow and a quiver of broadheads he had a mind to take a deer he had told them he was followed by four guardsmen in mailed shirts and coifs and joseth a stickthin stableman whom robb had named master of horse while hullen was away maester luwin brought up the rear riding on a donkey bran would have liked it better if he and robb had gone off alone just the two of them but hal mollen would not hear of it and maester luwin backed him if bran fell off his horse or injured himself the maester was determined to be with him beyond the castle lay the market square its wooden stalls deserted now they rode down the muddy streets of the village past rows of small neat houses of log and undressed stone less than one in five were occupied thin tendrils of woodsmoke curling up from their chimneys the rest would fill up one by one as it grew colder when the snow fell and the ice winds howled down out of the north old nan said farmers left their frozen fields and distant holdfasts loaded up their wagons and then the winter town came alive bran had never seen it happen but maester luwin said the day was looming closer the end of the long summer was near at hand winter is coming a few villagers eyed the direwolves anxiously as the riders went past and one man dropped the wood he was carrying as he shrank away in fear but most of the townfolk had grown used to the sight they bent the knee when they saw the boys and robb greeted each of them with a lordly nod with his legs unable to grip the swaying motion of the horse made bran feel unsteady at first but the huge saddle with its thick horn and high back cradled him comfortingly and the straps around his chest and thighs would not allow him to fall after a time the rhythm began to feel almost natural his anxiety faded and a tremulous smile crept across his face two serving wenches stood beneath the sign of the smoking log the local alehouse when theon greyjoy called out to them the younger girl turned red and covered her face theon spurred his mount to move up beside robb sweet kyra he said with a laugh she squirms like a weasel in bed but say a word to her on the street and she blushes pink as a maid did i ever tell you about the night that she and page bessa not where my brother can hear theon robb warned him with a glance at bran bran looked away and pretended not to have heard but he could feel greyjoys eyes on him no doubt he was smiling he smiled a lot as if the world were a secret joke that only he was clever enough to understand robb seemed to admire theon and enjoy his company but bran had never warmed to his fathers ward robb rode closer you are doing well bran i want to go faster bran replied robb smiled as you will he sent his gelding into a trot the wolves raced after him bran snapped the reins sharply and dancer picked up her pace he heard a shout from theon greyjoy and the hoofbeats of the other horses behind him brans cloak billowed out rippling in the wind and the snow seemed to rush at his face robb was well ahead glancing back over his shoulder from time to time to make sure bran and the others were following he snapped the reins again smooth as silk dancer slid into a gallop the distance closed by the time he caught robb on the edge of the wolfswood two miles beyond the winter town they had left the others well behind i can tide bran shouted grinning it felt almost as good as flying id race you but i fear youd win robbs tone was light and joking yet bran could tell that something was troubling his brother underneath the smile i dont want to race bran looked around for the direwolves both had vanished into the wood did you hear summer howling last night grey wind was restless too robb said his auburn hair had grown shaggy and unkempt and a reddish stubble covered his jaw making him look older than his fifteen years sometimes i think they know things sense things robb sighed i never know how much to tell you bran i wish you were older im eight now bran said eight isnt so much younger than fifteen and im the heir to winterfell after you so you are robb sounded sad and even a little scared bran i need to tell you something there was a bird last night from kings landing maester luwin woke me bran felt a sudden dread dark wings dark words old nan always said and of late the messenger ravens had been proving the truth of the proverb when robb wrote to the lord commander of the nights watch the bird that came back brought word that uncle benjen was still missing then a message had arrived from the eyrie from mother but that had not been good news either she did not say when she meant to return only that she had taken the imp as prisoner bran had sort of liked the little man yet the name lannister sent cold fingers creeping up his spine there was something about the lannisters page something he ought to remember but when he tried to think what he felt dizzy and his stomach clenched hard as a stone robb spent most of that day locked behind closed doors with maester luwin theon greyjoy and hallis mollen afterward riders were sent out on fast horses carrying robbs commands throughout the north bran heard talk of moat cailin the ancient stronghold the first men had built at the top of the neck no one ever told him what was happening yet he knew it was not good and now another raven another message bran clung to hope was the bird from mother is she coming home the message was from alyn in kings landing jory cassel is dead and wyl and heward as well murdered by the kingslayer robb lifted his face to the snow and the flakes melted on his cheeks may the gods give them rest bran did not know what to say he felt as if hed been punched jory had been captain of the household guard at winterfell since before bran was born they killed jory he remembered all the times jory had chased him over the roofs he could picture him striding across the yard in mail and plate or sitting at his accustomed place on the bench in the great hall joking as he ate why would anyone kill jory robb shook his head numbly the pain plain in his eyes i dont know and bran thats not the worst of it father was caught beneath a falling horse in the fight alyn says his leg was shattered and maester pycelle has given him the milk of the poppy but they arent sure when when he the sound of hoofbeats made him glance down the road to where theon and the others were coming up when he will wake robb finished he laid his hand on the pommel of his sword then and went on in the solemn voice of robb the lord bran i promise you whatever might happen i will not let this be forgotten something in his tone made bran even more fearful what will you do he asked as theon greyjoy reined in beside them theon thinks i should call the banners robb said blood for blood for once greyjoy did not smile his lean dark face had a hungry look to it and black hair fell down across his eyes only the lord can call the banners bran said as the snow drifted down around them if your father dies theon said robb will be lord of winterfell he wont die bran screamed at him robb took his hand he wont die not father he said calmly still the honor of the north is in my hands now when our lord father took his leave of us he told me to be strong for you and for rickon im almost a man grown bran bran shivered i wish mother was back he said miserably he looked around for maester luwin his donkey was visible in the far distance trotting over a rise does maester luwin say to call the banners page too the maester is timid as an old woman said theon father always listened to his counsel bran reminded his brother mother too i listen to him robb insisted i listen to everyone the joy bran had felt at the ride was gone melted away like the snowflakes on his face not so long ago the thought of robb calling the banners and riding off to war would have filled him with excitement but now he felt only dread can we go back now he asked im cold robb glanced around we need to find the wolves can you stand to go a bit longer i can go as long as you can maester luwin had warned him to keep the ride short for fear of saddle sores but bran would not admit to weakness in front of his brother he was sick of the way everyone was always fussing over him and asking how he was lets hunt down the hunters then robb said side by side they urged their mounts off the kingsroad and struck out into the wolfswood theon dropped back and followed well behind them talking and joking with the guardsmen it was nice under the trees bran kept dancer to a walk holding the reins lightly and looking all around him as they went he knew this wood but he had been so long confined to winterfell that he felt as though he were seeing it for the first time the smells filled his nostrils the sharp fresh tang of pine needles the earthy odor of wet rotting leaves the hints of animal musk and distant cooking fires he caught a glimpse of a black squirrel moving through the snowcovered branches of an oak and paused to study the silvery web of an empress spider theon and the others fell farther and farther behind until bran could no longer hear their voices from ahead came the faint sound of rushing waters it grew louder until they reached the stream tears stung his eyes bran robb asked whats wrong bran shook his head i was just remembering he said jory brought us here once to fish for trout you and me and jon do you remember i remember robb said his voice quiet and sad i didnt catch anything bran said but jon gave me his fish on the way back to winterfell will we ever see jon again we saw uncle benjen when the king came to visit robb pointed out jon will visit too youll see the stream was running high and fast robb dismounted and led his gelding across the ford in the deepest part of the crossing the water came up to midthigh he tied his horse to a tree on the far side and waded back across for bran and dancer the current foamed around rock and root and bran could feel the spray on his face as robb led him over it made him smile for a moment he felt strong again page and whole he looked up at the trees and dreamed of climbing them right up to the very top with the whole forest spread out beneath him they were on the far side when they heard the howl a long rising wail that moved through the trees like a cold wind bran raised his head to listen summer he said no sooner had he spoken than a second voice joined the first theyve made a kill robb said as he remounted id best go and bring them back wait here theon and the others should be along shortly i want to go with you bran said ill find them faster by myself robb spurred his gelding and vanished into the trees once he was gone the woods seemed to close in around bran the snow was falling more heavily now where it touched the ground it melted but all about him rock and root and branch wore a thin blanket of white as he waited he was conscious of how uncomfortable he felt he could not feel his legs hanging useless in the stirrups but the strap around his chest was tight and chafing and the melting snow had soaked through his gloves to chill his hands he wondered what was keeping theon and maester luwin and joseth and the rest when he heard the rustle of leaves bran used the reins to make dancer turn expecting to see his friends but the ragged men who stepped out onto the bank of the stream were strangers good day to you he said nervously one look and bran knew they were neither foresters nor farmers he was suddenly conscious of how richly he was dressed his surcoat was new dark grey wool with silver buttons and a heavy silver pin fastened his furtrimmed cloak at the shoulders his boots and gloves were lined with fur as well all alone are you said the biggest of them a bald man with a raw windburnt face lost in the wolfswood poor lad im not lost bran did not like the way the strangers were looking at him he counted four but when he turned his head he saw two others behind him my brother rode off just a moment ago and my guard will be here shortly your guard is it a second man said grey stubble covered his gaunt face and what would they be guarding my little lord is that a silver pin i see there on your cloak pretty said a womans voice she scarcely looked like a woman tall and lean with the same hard face as the others her hair hidden beneath a bowlshaped halfhelm the spear she held was eight feet of black oak tipped in rusted steel lets have a look said the big bald man bran watched him anxiously the mans clothes were filthy fallen almost to pieces patched here with brown and here with blue and there with a dark green and faded everywhere to grey but once that cloak might have been black the grey stubbly man wore black rags too he saw with a sudden start page suddenly bran remembered the oathbreaker his father had beheaded the day they had found the wolf pups that man had worn black as well and father said he had been a deserter from the nights watch no man is more dangerous he remembered lord eddard saying the deserter knows his life is forfeit if he is taken so he will notflinch from any crime no matter how vile or cruel the pin lad the big man said he held out his hand well take the horse too said another of them a woman shorter than robb with a broad fiat face and lank yellow hair get down and be quick about it a knife slid from her sleeve into her hand its edge jagged as a saw no bran blurted i cant the big man grabbed his reins before bran could think to wheel dancer around and gallop off you can lordling and will if you know whats good for you stiv look how hes strapped on the tall woman pointed with her spear might be its the truth hes telling straps is it stiv said he drew a dagger from a sheath at his belt theres ways to deal with straps you some kind of cripple asked the short woman bran flared im brandon stark of winterfell and you better let go of my horse or ill see you all dead the gaunt man with the grey stubbled face laughed the boys a stark true enough only a stark would be fool enough to threaten where smarter men would beg cut his little cock off and stuff it in his mouth suggested the short woman that should shut him up youre as stupid as you are ugly hali said the tall woman the boys worth nothing dead but alive gods be damned think what mance would give to have benjen starks own blood to hostage mance be damned the big man cursed you want to go back there osha more fool you think the white walkers will care if you have a hostage he turned back to bran and slashed at the strap around his thigh the leather parted with a sigh the stroke had been quick and careless biting deep looking down bran glimpsed pale flesh where the wool of his leggings had parted then the blood began to flow he watched the red stain spread feeling lightheaded curiously apart there had been no pain not even a hint of feeling the big man grunted in surprise put down your steel now and i promise you shall have a quick and painless death robb called out bran looked up in desperate hope and there he was the strength of the words were undercut by the way his voice cracked with strain he was mounted the bloody carcass of an elk slung across the back of his horse his sword in a gloved hand the brother said the man with the grey stubbly face page hes a fierce one he is mocked the short woman hali they called her you mean to fight us boy dont be a fool lad youre one against six the tall woman osha leveled her spear off the horse and throw down the sword well thank you kindly for the mount and for the venison and you and your brother can be on your way robb whistled they heard the faint sound of soft feet on wet leaves the undergrowth parted lowhanging branches giving up their accumulation of snow and grey wind and summer emerged from the green summer sniffed the air and growled wolves gasped hali direwolves bran said still halfgrown they were as large as any wolf he had ever seen but the differences were easy to spot if you knew what to look for maester luwin and farlen the kennelmaster had taught him a direwolf had a bigger head and longer legs in proportion to its body and its snout and jaw were markedly leaner and more pronounced there was something gaunt and terrible about them as they stood there amid the gently falling snow fresh blood spotted grey winds muzzle dogs the big bald man said contemptuously yet im told theres nothing like a wolfskin cloak to warm a man by night he made a sharp gesture take them robb shouted winterfell and kicked his horse the gelding plunged down the bank as the ragged men closed a man with an axe rushed in shouting and heedless robbs sword caught him full in the face with a sickening crunch and a spray of bright blood the man with the gaunt stubbly face made a grab for the reins and for half a second he had them and then grey wind was on him bearing him down he fell back into the stream with a splash and a shout flailing wildly with his knife as his head went under the direwolf plunged in after him and the white water turned red where they had vanished robb and osha matched blows in midstream her long spear was a steelheaded serpent flashing out at his chest once twice three times but robb parried every thrust with his longsword turning the point aside on the fourth or fifth thrust the tall woman overextended herself and lost her balance just for a second robb charged riding her down a few feet away summer darted in and snapped at hali the knife bit at his flank summer slid away snarling and came rushing in again this time his jaws closed around her calf holding the knife with both hands the small woman stabbed down but the direwolf seemed to sense the blade coming he pulled free for an instant his mouth full of leather and cloth and bloody flesh when hali stumbled and fell he came at her again slamming her backward teeth tearing at her belly the sixth man ran from the carnage but not far as he went scrambling up the far side of the bank grey wind emerged from the stream dripping wet he shook the water off and bounded after the running man hamstringing him with a single snap of his teeth and going for the throat as the screaming man slid back down toward the water and then there was no one left but the big man stiv he slashed at brans chest strap grabbed his arm and yanked suddenly bran was falling he sprawled on the ground his legs tangled under him one foot page in the stream he could not feel the cold of the water but he felt the steel when stiv pressed his dagger to his throat back away the man warned or ill open the boys windpipe i swear it robb reined his horse in breathing hard the fury went out of his eyes and his sword arm dropped in that moment bran saw everything summer was savaging hali pulling glistening blue snakes from her belly her eyes were wide and staring bran could not tell whether she was alive or dead the grey stubbly man and the one with the axe lay unmoving but osha was on her knees crawling toward her fallen spear grey wind padded toward her dripping wet call him off the big man shouted call them both off or the cripple boy dies now grey wind summer to me robb said the direwolves stopped turned their heads grey wind loped back to robb summer stayed where he was his eyes on bran and the man beside him he growled his muzzle was wet and red but his eyes burned osha used the butt end of her spear to lever herself back to her feet blood leaked from a wound on the upper arm where robb had cut her bran could see sweat trickling down the big mans face stiv was as scared as he was he realized starks the man muttered bloody starks he raised his voice osha kill the wolves and get his sword kill them yourself she replied ill not be getting near those monsters for a moment stiv was at a loss his hand trembled bran felt a trickle of blood where the knife pressed against his neck the stench of the man filled his nose he smelled of fear you he called out to robb you have a name i am robb stark the heir to winterfell this is your brother yes you want him alive you do what i say off the horse robb hesitated a moment then slowly and deliberately he dismounted and stood with his sword in hand now kill the wolves robb did not move you do it the wolves or the boy no bran screamed if robb did as they asked stiv would kill them both anyway once the direwolves were dead the bald man took hold of his hair with his free hand and twisted it cruelly till bran sobbed in pain you page shut your mouth cripple you hear me he twisted harder you hear me a low thrum came from the woods behind them stiv gave a choked gasp as a half foot of razortipped broadhead suddenly exploded out of his chest the arrow was bright red as if it had been painted in blood the dagger fell away from brans throat the big man swayed and collapsed facedown in the stream the arrow broke beneath him bran watched his life go swirling off in the water osha glanced around as fathers guardsmen appeared from beneath the trees steel in hand she threw down her spear mercy mlord she called to robb the guardsmen had a strange pale look to their faces as they took in the scene of slaughter they eyed the wolves uncertainly and when summer returned to halis corpse to feed joseth dropped his knife and scrambled for the bush heaving even maester luwin seemed shocked as he stepped from behind a tree but only for an instant then he shook his head and waded across the stream to brans side are you hurt he cut my leg bran said but i couldnt feel it as the maester knelt to examine the wound bran turned his head theon greyjoy stood beside a sentinel tree his bow in hand he was smiling ever smiling a halfdozen arrows were thrust into the soft ground at his feet but it had taken only one a dead enemy is a thing of beauty he announced jon always said you were an ass greyjoy robb said loudly i ought to chain you up in the yard and let bran take a few practice shots at you you should be thanking me for saving your brothers life what if you had missed the shot robb said what if youd only wounded him what if you had made his hand jump or hit bran instead for all you knew the man might have been wearing a breastplate all you could see was the back of his cloak what would have happened to my brother then did you ever think of that greyjoy theons smile was gone he gave a sullen shrug and began to pull his arrows from the ground one by one robb glared at his guardsmen where were you he demanded of them i was sure you were close behind us the men traded unhappy glances we were following mlord said quent the youngest of them his beard a soft brown fuzz only first we waited for maester luwin and his ass begging your pardons and then well as it were he glanced over at theon and quickly looked away abashed i spied a turkey theon said annoyed by the question how was i to know that youd leave the boy alone robb turned his head to look at theon once more bran had never seen him so angry yet he said page nothing finally he knelt beside maester luwin how badly is my brother wounded no more than a scratch the maester said he wet a cloth in the stream to clean the cut two of them wear the black he told robb as he worked robb glanced over at where stiv lay sprawled in the stream his ragged black cloak moving fitfully as the rushing waters tugged at it deserters from the nights watch he said grimly they must have been fools to come so close to winterfell folly and desperation are ofttimes hard to tell apart said maester luwin a gaml of thronls shall we bury them mlord asked quent they would not have buried us robb said hack off their heads well send them back to the wall leave the rest for the carrion crows and this one quent jerked a thumb toward osha robb walked over to her she was a head taller than he was but she dropped to her knees at his approach give me my life mord of stark and i am yours mine what would i do with an oathbreaker i broke no oaths stiv and wallen flew down off the wall not me the black crows got no place for women theon greyjoy sauntered closer give her to the wolves he urged robb the womans eyes went to what was left of hali and just as quickly away she shuddered even the guardsmen looked queasy shes a woman robb said a wildling bran told him she said they should keep me alive so they could take me to mance rayder do you have a name robb asked her osha as it please the lord she muttered sourly maester luwin stood we might do well to question her bran could see the relief on his brothers face as you say maester wayn bind her hands shell come back to winterfell with us and live or die by the truths she gives us tyrion yu want eat mord asked glowering he had a plate of oiled beans in one thick stubfingered hand page tyrion lannister was starved but he refused to let this brute see him cringe a leg of lamb would be pleasant he said from the heap of soiled straw in the corner of his cell perhaps a dish of peas and onions some fresh baked bread with butter and a flagon of mulled wine to wash it down or beer if thats easier i try not to be overly particular is beans mord said here he held out the plate tyrion sighed the turnkey was twenty stone of gross stupidity with brown rotting teeth and small dark eyes the left side of his face was slick with scar where an axe had cut off his ear and part of his cheek he was as predictable as he was ugly but tyrion was hungry he reached up for the plate mord jerked it away grinning is here he said holding it out beyond tyrions reach the dwarf climbed stiffly to his feet every joint aching must we play the same fools game with every meal he made another grab for the beans mord shambled backward grinning through his rotten teeth is here dwarf man he held the plate out at arms length over the edge where the cell ended and the sky began you not want eat here come take tyrions arms were too short to reach the plate and he was not about to step that close to the edge all it would take would be a quick shove of mords heavy white belly and he would end up a sickening red splotch on the stones of sky like so many other prisoners of the eyrie over the centuries come to think on it im not hungry after all he declared retreating to the corner of his cell mord grunted and opened his thick fingers the wind took the plate flipping it over as it fell a handful of beans sprayed back at them as the food tumbled out of sight the turnkey laughed his gut shaking like a bowl of pudding tyrion felt a pang of rage you fucking son of a poxridden ass he spat i hope you die of a bloody flux for that mord gave him a kick driving a steeltoed boot hard into tyrions ribs on the way out i take it back he gasped as he doubled over on the straw ill kill you myself i swear it the heavy ironbound door slammed shut tyrion heard the rattle of keys for a small man he had been cursed with a dangerously big mouth he reflected as he crawled back to his corner of what the arryns laughably called their dungeon he huddled beneath the thin blanket that was his only bedding staring out at a blaze of empty blue sky and distant mountains that seemed to go on forever wishing he still had the shadowskin cloak hed won from marillion at dice after the singer had stolen it off the body of that brigand chief the skin had smelled of blood and mold but it was warm and thick mord had taken it the moment he laid eyes on it the wind tugged at his blanket with gusts sharp as talons his cell was miserably small even for a dwarf not five feet away where a wall ought to have been where a wall would be in a proper dungeon the floor ended and the sky began he had plenty of fresh air and sunshine and the moon and stars by night but tyrion would have traded it all in an instant for the dankest gloomiest pit in the bowels of the casterly rock page you fly mord had promised him when hed shoved him into the cell twenty day thirty fifty maybe then you fly the arryns kept the only dungeon in the realm where the prisoners were welcome to escape at will that first day after girding up his courage for hours tyrion had lain flat on his stomach and squirmed to the edge to poke out his head and look down sky was six hundred feet below with nothing between but empty air if he craned his neck out as far as it could go he could see other cells to his right and left and above him he was a bee in a stone honeycomb and someone had torn off his wings it was cold in the cell the wind screamed night and day and worst of all the floor sloped ever so slightly yet it was enough he was afraid to close his eyes afraid that he might roll over in his steep and wake in sudden terror as he went sliding off the edge small wonder the sky cells drove men mad gods save me some previous tenant had written on the wall in something that looked suspiciously like blood the blue is calling at first tyrion wondered who hed been and what had become of him later he decided that he would rather not know if only he had shut his mouth the wretched boy had started it looking down on him from a throne of carved weirwood beneath the moonandfalcon banners of house arryn tyrion lannister had been looked down on all his life but seldom by rheumyeyed sixyearolds who needed to stuff fat cushions under their cheeks to lift them to the height of a man is he the bad man the boy had asked clutching his doll he is the lady lysa had said from the lesser throne beside him she was all in blue powdered and perfumed for the suitors who filled her court hes so small the lord of the eyrie said giggling this is tyrion the imp of house lannister who murdered your father she raised her voice so it carried down the length of high hall of the eyrie ringing off the milkwhite walls and the slender pillars so every man could hear it he slew the hand of the king oh did i kill him too tyrion had said like a fool that would have been a very good time to have kept his mouth closed and his head bowed he could see that now seven hells he had seen it then the high hall of the arryns was long and austere with a forbidding coldness to its walls of blueveined white marble but the faces around him had been colder by far the power of casterly rock was far away and there were no friends of the lannisters in the vale of arryn submission and silence would have been his best defenses but tyrions mood had been too foul for sense to his shame he had faltered during the last leg of their daylong climb up to the eyrie his stunted legs unable to take him any higher brorm had carried him the rest of the way and the humiliation poured oil on the flames of his anger it would seem ive been a busy little fellow he said with bitter sarcasm i wonder when i found the time to do all this slaying and murdering page he ought to have remembered who he was dealing with lysa arryn and her halfsane weakling son had not been known at court for their love of wit especially when it was directed at them imp lysa said coldly you will guard that mocking tongue of yours and speak to my son politely or i promise you will have cause to regret it remember where you are this is the eyrie and these are knights of the vale you see around you true men who loved jon arryn well every one of them would die for me lady arryn should any harm come to me my brother jaime will be pleased to see that they do even as he spat out the words tyrion knew they were folly can you fly my lord of lannister lady lysa asked does a dwarf have wings if not you would be wiser to swallow the next threat that comes to mind i made no threats tyrion said that was a promise little lord robert hopped to his feet at that so upset he dropped his doll you cant hurt us he screamed no one can hurt us here tell him mother tell him he cant hurt us here the boy began to twitch the eyrie is impregnable lysa arryn declared calmly she drew her son close holding him safe in the circle of her plump white arms the imp is trying to frighten us sweet baby the lannisters are all liars no one will hurt my sweet boy the hell of it was she was no doubt right having seen what it took to get here tyrion could well imagine how it would be for a knight trying to fight his way up in armor while stones and arrows poured down from above and enemies contested with him for every step nightmare did not begin to describe it small wonder the eyrie had never been taken still tyrion had been unable to silence himself not impregnable he said merely inconvenient young robert pointed down his hand trembling youre a liar mother i want to see him fly two guardsmen in skyblue cloaks seized tyrion by the arms lifting him off his floor the gods only know what might have happened then were it not for catelyn stark sister she called out from where she stood below the thrones i beg you to remember this man is my prisoner i will not have him harmed lysa arryn glanced at her sister coolly for a moment then rose and swept down on tyrion her long skirts trailing after her for an instant he feared she would strike him but instead she commanded them to release him her men shoved him to the floor his legs went out from under him and tyrion fell he must have made quite a sight as he struggled to his knees only to feel his right leg spasm sending him sprawling once more laughter boomed up and down the high hall of the arryns page my sisters little guest is too weary to stand lady lysa announced ser vardis take him down to the dungeon a rest in one of our sky cells will do him much good the guardsmen jerked him upright tyrion lannister dangled between them kicking feebly his face red with shame i will remember this he told them all as they carried him off and so he did for all the good it did him at first he had consoled himself that this imprisonment could not last long lysa arryn wanted to humble him that was all she would send for him again and soon if not her then catelyn stark would want to question him this time he would guard his tongue more closely they dare not kill him out of hand he was still a lannister of casterly rock and if they shed his blood it would mean war or so he had told himself now he was not so certain perhaps his captors only meant to let him rot here but he feared he did not have the strength to rot for long he was growing weaker every day and it was only a matter of time until mords kicks and blows did him serious harm provided the gaoler did not starve him to death first a few more nights of cold and hunger and the blue would start calling to him too he wondered what was happening beyond the walls such as they were of his cell lord tywin would surely have sent out riders when the word reached him jaime might be leading a host through the mountains of the moon even now unless he was riding north against winterfell instead did anyone outside the vale even suspect where catelyn stark had taken him he wondered what cersei would do when she heard the king could order him freed but would robert listen to his queen or his hand tyrion had no illusions about the kings love for his sister if cersei kept her wits about her she would insist the king sit in judgment of tyrion himself even ned stark could scarcely object to that not without impugning the honor of the king and tyrion would be only too glad to take his chances in a trial whatever murders they might lay at his door the starks had no proof of anything so far as he could see let them make their case before the iron throne and the lords of the land it would be the end of them if only cersei were clever enough to see that tyrion lannister sighed his sister was not without a certain low a gaml of thronls cunning but her pride blinded her she would see the insult in this not the opportunity and jaime was even worse rash and headstrong and quick to anger his brother never untied a knot when he could slash it in two with his sword he wondered which of them had sent the footpad to silence the stark boy and whether they had truly conspired at the death of lord arryn if the old hand had been murdered it was deftly and subtly done men of his age died of sudden illness all the time in contrast sending some oaf with a stolen knife after brandon stark struck him as unbelievably clumsy and wasnt that peculiar come to think on it tyrion shivered now there was a nasty suspicion perhaps the direwolf and the lion were not the only beasts in the woods and if that was true someone was using him as a catspaw tyrion lannister hated being used page he would have to get out of here and soon his chances of overpowering mord were small to none and no one was about to smuggle him a sixhundredfootlong rope so he would have to talk himself free his mouth had gotten him into this cell it could damn well get him out tyrion pushed himself to his feet doing his best to ignore the slope of the floor beneath him with its eversosubtle tug toward the edge he hammered on the door with a fist mord he shouted turnkey mord i want you he had to keep it up a good ten minutes before he heard footsteps tyrion stepped back an instant before the door opened with a crash making noise mord growled with blood in his eyes dangling from one meaty hand was a leather strap wide and thick doubled over in his fist never show them youre afraid tyrion reminded himself how would you like to be rich he asked mord hit him he swung the strap backhand lazily but the leather caught tyrion high on the arm the force of it staggered him and the pain made him grit his teeth no mouth dwarf man mord warned him gold tyrion said miming a smile casterly rock is full of gold ahhhh this time the blow was a forehand and mord put more of his arm into the swing making the leather crack and jump it caught tyrion in the ribs and dropped him to his knees wimpering he forced himself to look up at the gaoler as rich as the lannisters he wheezed thats what they say mord mord grunted the strap whistled through the air and smashed tyrion full in the face the pain was so bad he did not remember falling but when he opened his eyes again he was on the floor of his cell his ear was ringing and his mouth was full of blood he groped for purchase to push himself up and his fingers brushed against nothing tyrion snatched his hand back as fast as if it had been scalded and tried his best to stop breathing he had fallen right on the edge inches from the blue more to say mord held the strap between his fists and gave it a sharp pull the snap made tyrion jump the turnkey laughed he wontpush me over tyrion told himself desperately as he crawled away from the edge catelyn stark wants me alive he doesnt dare kill me he wiped the blood off his lips with the back of his hand grinned and said that was a stiff one mord the gaoler squinted at him trying to decide if he was being mocked i could make good use of a strong man like you the strap flew at him but this time tyrion was able to cringe away from it he took a glancing blow to the shoulder nothing more gold he repeated scrambling backward like a crab more gold than youll see here in a lifetime enough to buy land women horses you could be a lord lord mord tyrion hawked up a glob of blood and phlegm and spat it out into the sky is no gold mord said hes listening tyrion thought they relieved me of my purse when they captured me but the gold is still mine catelyn stark might take a man prisoner but shed never stoop to rob him that wouldnt be honorable help me and all the gold is yours mords strap licked out but it was a halfhearted page desultory swing slow and contemptuous tyrion caught the leather in his hand and held it prisoned there will be no risk to you all you need do is deliver a message the gaoler yanked his leather strap free of tyrions grasp message he said as if he had never heard the word before his frown made deep creases in his brow you heard me my lord only carry my word to your lady tell her at at would possibly make lysa anyn relent the inspiration came to tyrion lannister suddenly tell her that i wish to confess my crimes mord raised his arm and tyrion braced himself for another blow but the turnkey hesitated suspicion and greed warred in his eyes he wanted that gold yet he feared a trick he had the look of a man who had often been tricked is lie he muttered darkly dwarf man cheat me i will put my promise in writing tyrion vowed some illiterates held writing in disdain others seemed to have a superstitious reverence for the written word as if it were some sort of a gaml of thronls magic fortunately mord was one of the latter the turnkey lowered the strap writing down gold much gold oh much gold tyrion assured him the purse is just a taste my friend my brother wears armor of solid gold plate in truth jaimes armor was gilded steel but this oaf would never know the difference mord fingered his strap thoughtfully but in the end he relented and went to fetch paper and ink when the letter was written the gaoler frowned at it suspiciously now deliver my message tyrion urged he was shivering in his sleep when they came for him late that night mord opened the door but kept his silence ser vardis egen woke tyrion with the point of his boot on your feet imp my lady wants to see you tyrion rubbed the sleep from his eyes and put on a grimace he scarcely felt no doubt she does but what makes you think i wish to see her ser vardis frowned tyrion remembered him well from the years he had spent at kings landing as the captain of the hands household guard a square plain face silver hair a heavy build and no humor whatsoever your wishes are not my concern on your feet or ill have you carried tyrion clambered awkwardly to his feet a cold night he said casually and the high hall is so drafty i dont wish to catch a chill mord if you would be so good fetch my cloak the gaoler squinted at him face dull with suspicion my cloak tyrion repeated the shadowskin you took from me for safekeeping you recall get him the damnable cloak ser vardis said mord did not dare grumble he gave tyrion a glare that promised future retribution yet he went for the page cloak when he draped it around his prisoners neck tyrion smiled my thanks i shall think of you whenever i wear it he flung the trailing end of the long fur over his right shoulder and felt warm for the first time in days lead on ser vardis the high hall of the arryns was aglow with the light of fifty torches burning in the sconces along the walls the lady lysa wore black silk with the moonandfalcon sewn on her breast in pearls since she did not look the sort to join the nights watch tyrion could only imagine that she had decided mourning clothes were appropriate garb for a confession her long auburn hair woven into an elaborate braid fell across her left shoulder the taller throne beside her was empty no doubt the little lord of the eyrie was off shaking in his sleep tyrion was thankful for that much at least he bowed deeply and took a moment to glance around the hall lady arryn had summoned her knights and retainers to hear his confession as he had hoped he saw ser brynden tullys craggy face and lord nestor royces bluff one beside nestor stood a younger man with fierce black sidewhiskers who could only be his heir ser albar most of the principal houses of the vale were represented tyrion noted ser lyn corbray slender as a sword lord hunter with his gouty legs the widowed lady waynwood surrounded by her sons others sported sigils he did not know broken lance green viper burning tower winged chalice among the lords of the vale were several of his companions from the high road ser rodrik cassel pale from halfhealed wounds stood with ser willis wode beside him marillion the singer had found a new woodharp tyrion smiled whatever happened here tonight he did not wish it to happen in secret and there was no one like a singer for spreading a story near and far in the rear of the hall bronn lounged beneath a pillar the freeriders black eyes were fixed on tyrion and his hand lay lightly on the pommel of his sword tyrion gave him a long look wondering catelyn stark spoke first you wish to confess your crimes we are told i do my lady tyrion answered lysa arryn smiled at her sister the sky cells always break them the gods can see them there and there is no darkness to hide in he does not look broken to me lady catelyn said lady lysa paid her no mind say what you will she commanded tyrion and now to roll the dice he thought with another quick glance back at bronn where to begin i am a vile little man i confess it my crimes and sins are beyond counting my lords and ladies i have lain with whores not once but hundreds of times i have wished my own lord father dead and my sister our gracious queen as well behind him someone chuckled i have not always treated my servants with kindness i have gambled i have even cheated i blush to admit i have said many cruel and malicious things about the noble lords and ladies of the court that drew outright laughter once i silence lysa arryns pale round face had turned a burning pink what do you imagine you are doing dwarf page tyrion cocked his head to one side why confessing my crimes my lady catelyn stark took a step forward you are accused of sending a hired knife to slay my son bran in his bed and of conspiring to murder lord jon arryn the hand of the king tyrion gave a helpless shrug those crimes i cannot confess i fear i know nothing of any murders lady lysa rose from her weirwood throne i will not be made mock of you have had your little jape imp i trust you enjoyed it ser vardis take him back to the dungeon but this time find him a smaller cell with a floor more sharply sloped is this how justice is done in the vale tyrion roared so loudly that ser vardis froze for an instant does honor stop at the bloody gate you accuse me of crimes i deny them so you throw me into an open cell to freeze and starve he lifted his head to give them all a good look at the bruises mord had left on his face where is the kings justice is the eyrie not part of the seven kingdoms i stand accused you say very well i demand a ttial let me speak and let my truth or falsehood be judged openly in the sight of gods and men a low murmuring filled the high hall he had her tyrion knew he was highborn the son of the most powerful lord in the realm the brother of the queen he could not be denied a trial guardsmen in skyblue cloaks had started toward tyrion but ser vardis bid them halt and looked to lady lysa her small mouth twitched in a petulant smile if you are tried and found to be guilty of the crimes for which you stand accused then by the kings own laws you must pay with your lifes blood we keep no headsman in the eyrie my lord of lannister open the moon door the press of spectators parted a narrow weirwood door stood between two slender marble pillars a crescent moon carved in the white wood those standing closest edged backward as a pair of guardsmen marched through one man removed the heavy bronze bars the second pulled the door inward their blue cloaks rose snapping from their shoulders caught in the sudden gust of wind that came howling through the open door beyond was the emptiness of the night sky speckled with cold uncaring stars behold the kings justice lysa arryn said torch flames fluttered like permons along the walls and here and there the odd torch guttered out lysa i think this unwise catelyn stark said as the black wind swirled around the hall her sister ignored her you want a trial my lord of lannister very well a trial you shall have my son will listen to whatever you care to say and you shall hear his judgment then you may leave by one door or the other she looked so pleased with herself tyrion thought and small wonder how could a trial threaten her when her weakling son was the lord judge tyrion glanced at her moon door mother i want to see him fly the boy had said how many men had the snotnosed little wretch sent through that door already page i thank you my good lady but i see no need to trouble lord robert tyrion said politely the gods know the truth of my innocence i will have their verdict not the judgment of men i demand trial by combat a storm of sudden laughter filled the high hall of the arryns lord nestor royce snorted ser willis chuckled ser lyn corbray guffawed and others threw back their heads and howled until tears ran down their faces marillion clumsily plucked a gay note on his new woodharp with the fingers of his broken hand even the wind seemed to whistle with derision as it came skirling through the moon door lysa arryns watery blue eyes looked uncertain he had caught her off balance you have that right to be sure the young knight with the green viper embroidered on his surcoat stepped forward and went to one knee my lady i beg the boon of championing your cause the honor should be mine old lord hunter said for the love i bore your lord husband let me avenge his death my father served lord jon faithfully as high steward of the vale ser albar royce boomed let me serve his son in this the gods favor the man with the just cause said ser lyn corbray yet often that turns out to be the man with the surest sword we all know who that is he smiled modestly a dozen other men all spoke at once clamoring to be heard tyrion found it disheartening to realize so many strangers were eager to kill him perhaps this had not been such a clever plan after all lady lysa raised a hand for silence i thank you my lords as i know my son would thank you if he were among us no men in the seven kingdoms are as bold and true as the knights of the vale would that i could grant you all this honor yet i can choose only one she gestured ser vardis egen you were ever my lord husbands good right hand you shall be our champion ser vardis had been singularly silent my lady he said gravely sinking to one knee pray give this burden to another i have no taste for it the man is no warrior look at him a dwarf half my size and lame in the legs it would be shameful to slaughter such a man and call it justice oh excellent tyrion thought i agree lysa glared at him you demanded a trial by combat and now i demand a champion such as you have chosen for yourself my brother jaime will gladly take my part i know your precious kingslayer is hundreds of leagues from here snapped lysa arryn send a bird for him i will gladly await his arrival page you will face ser vardis on the morrow singer tyrion said turning to marillion when you make a ballad of this be certain you tell them how lady arryn denied the dwarf the right to a champion and sent him forth lame and bruised and hobbling to face her finest knight i deny you nothing lysa arryn said her voice peeved and shrill with irritation name your champion imp if you think you can find a man to die for you if it is all the same to you id sooner find one to kill for me tyrion looked over the long hall no one moved for a long moment he wondered if it had all been a colossal blunder then there was a stirring in the rear of the chamber ill stand for the dwarf bronn called out eddard he dreamt an old dream of three knights in white cloaks and a tower long fallen and lyanna in her bed of blood in the dream his friends rode with him as they had in life proud martyn cassel jorys father faithful theo wull ethan glover who had been brandons squire ser mark ryswell soft of speech and gentle of heart the crannogman howland reed lord dustin on his great red stallion ned had known their faces as well as he knew his own once but the years leech at a mans memories even those he has vowed never to forget in the dream they were only shadows grey wraiths on horses made of mist they were seven facing three in the dream as it had been in life yet these were no ordinary three they waited before the round tower the red mountains of dorne at their backs their white cloaks blowing in the wind and these were no shadows their faces burned clear even now ser arthur dayne the sword of the morning had a sad smile on his lips the hilt of the greatsword dawn poked up over his right shoulder ser oswell whent was on one knee sharpening his blade with a whetstone across his whiteenameled helm the black bat of his house spread its wings between them stood fierce old ser gerold hightower the white bull lord commander of the kingsguard i looked for you on the trident ned said to them we were not there ser gerold answered woe to the usurper if we had been said ser oswell when kings landing fell ser jaime slew your king with a golden sword and i wondered where you were far away ser gerold said or aerys would yet sit the iron throne and our false brother would burn in seven hells i came down on storms end to lift the siege ned told them and the lords tyrell and redwyne dipped their banners and all their knights bent the knee to pledge us fealty i was certain you would be page among them our knees do not bend easily said ser arthur dayne ser willem darry is fled to dragonstone with your queen and prince viserys i thought you might have sailed with him ser willem is a good man and true said ser oswell but not of the kingsguard ser gerold pointed out the kingsguard does not flee then or now said ser arthur he donned his helm we swore a vow explained old ser gerold neds wraiths moved up beside him with shadow swords in hand they were seven against three and now it begins said ser arthur dayne the sword of the morning he unsheathed dawn and held it with both hands the blade was pale as milkglass alive with light no ned said with sadness in his voice now it ends as they came together in a rush of steel and shadow he could hear lyanna screaming eddard she called a storm of rose petals blew across a bloodstreaked sky as blue as the eyes of death lord eddard lyanna called again i promise he whispered lya i promise lord eddard a man echoed from the dark groaning eddard stark opened his eyes moonlight streamed through the tall windows of the tower of the hand lord eddard a shadow stood over the bed how how long the sheets were tangled his leg splinted and plastered a dull throb of pain shot up his side six days and seven nights the voice was vayon pooles the steward held a cup to neds lips drink my lord what t only water maester pycelle said you would be thirsty ned drank his lips were parched and cracked the water tasted sweet as honey the king left orders vayon poole told him when the cup was empty he would speak with you my lord glorge rr martin page on the morrow ned said when i am stronger he could not face robert now the dream had left him weak as a kitten my lord poole said he commanded us to send you to him the moment you opened your eyes the steward busied himself lighting a bedside candle ned cursed softly robert was never known for his patience tell him im too weak to come to him if he wishes to speak with me i should be pleased to receive him here i hope you wake him from a sound sleep and summon he was about to say jory when he remembered summon the captain of my guard alyn stepped into the bedchamber a few moments after the steward had taken his leave my lord poole tells me it has been six days ned said i must know how things stand the kingslayer is fled the city alyn told him the talk is hes ridden back to casterly rock to join his father the story of how lady catelyn took the imp is on every lip i have put on extra guards if it please you it does ned assured him my daughters they have been with you every day my lord sansa prays quietly but arya he hesitated she has not said a word since they brought you back she is a fierce little thing my lord i have never seen such anger in a girl whatever happens ned said i want my daughters kept safe i fear this is only the beginning no harm will come to them lord eddard alyn said i stake my life on that jory and the others j gave them over to the silent sisters to be sent north to winterfell jory would want to lie beside his grandfather it would have to be his grandfather for jorys father was buried far to the south martyn cassel had perished with the rest ned had pulled the tower down afterward and used its bloody stones to build eight cairns upon the ridge it was said that rhaegar had named that place the tower of joy but for ned it was a bitter memory they had been seven against three yet only two had lived to ride away eddard stark himself and the little crannogman howland reed he did not think it omened well that he should dream that dream again after so many years youve done well alyn ned was saying when vayon poole returned the steward bowed low his grace is without my lord and the queen with him ned pushed himself up higher wincing as his leg trembled with pain he had not expected cersei to come it did not bode well that she had send them in and leave us what we have to say should not go beyond these walls poole withdrew quietly page robert had taken time to dress he wore a black velvet doublet with the crowned stag of baratheon worked upon the breast in golden thread and a golden mantle with a cloak of black and gold squares a flagon of wine was in his hand his face already flushed from drink cersei lannister entered behind him a jeweled tiara in her hair your grace ned said your pardons i cannot rise no matter the king said gruffly some wine from the arbor a good vintage a small cup ned said my head is still heavy from the milk of the poppy a man in your place should count himself fortunate that his head is still on his shoulders the queen declared quiet woman robert snapped he brought ned a cup of wine does the leg still pain you some ned said his head was swimming but it would not do to admit to weakness in front of the queen pycelle swears it will heal clean robert frowned i take it you know what catelyn has done i do ned took a small swallow of wine my lady wife is blameless your grace all she did she did at my command i am not pleased ned robert grumbled by what right do you dare lay hands on my blood cersei demanded who do you think you are the hand of the king ned told her with icy courtesy charged by your own lord husband to keep the kings peace and enforce the kings justice you were the hand cersei began but now silence the king roared you asked him a question and he answered it cersei subsided cold with anger and robert turned back to ned keep the kings peace you say is this how you keep my peace ned seven men are dead eight the queen corrected tregar died this morning of the blow lord stark gave him abductions on the kingsroad and drunken slaughter in my streets the king said i will not have it ned catelyn had good reason for taking the irnp i said i will not have it to hell with her reasons you will command her to release the dwarf at once and you will make your peace with jaime three of my men were butchered before my eyes because jaime lannister wished to chasten me am i page to forget that my brother was not the cause of this quarrel cersei told the king lord stark was returning drunk from a brothel his men attacked jaime and his guards even as his wife attacked tyrion on the kingsroad you know me better than that robert ned said ask lord baelish if you doubt me he was there ive talked to littlefinger robert said he claims he rode off to bring the gold cloaks before the fighting began but he admits you were returning from some whorehouse some whorehouse damn your eyes robert i went there to have a look at your daughter her mother has named her barra she looks like that first girl you fathered when we were boys together in the vale he watched the queen as he spoke her face was a mask still and pale betraying nothing robert flushed barra he grumbled is that supposed to please me damn the girl i thought she had more sense she cannot be more than fifteen and a whore and you thought she had sense ned said incredulous his leg was beginning to pain him sorely it was hard to keep his temper the fool child is in love with you robert the king glanced at cersei this is no fit subject for the queens ears her grace will have no liking for anything i have to say ned replied i am told the kingslayer has fled the city give me leave to bring him back to justice the king swirled the wine in his cup brooding he took a swallow no he said i want no more of this jaime slew three of your men and you five of his now it ends is that your notion of justice ned flared if so i am pleased that i am no longer your hand the queen looked to her husband if any man had dared speak to a targaryen as he has spoken to you do you take me for aerys robert interrupted i took you for a king jaime and tyrion are your own brothers by all the laws of marriage and the bonds we share the starks have driven off the one and seized the other this man dishonors you with every breath he takes and yet you stand there meekly asking if his leg pains him and would he like some wine roberts face was dark with anger how many times must i tell you to hold your tongue woman cerseis face was a study in contempt what a jape the gods have made of us two she said by all rights you ought to be in skirts and me in mail purple with rage the king lashed out a vicious backhand blow to the side of the head she stumbled against the table and fell hard yet cersei lannister did not cry out her slender fingers brushed her page cheek where the pale smooth skin was already reddening on the morrow the bruise would cover half her face i shall wear this as a badge of honor she announced wear it in silence or ill honor you again robert vowed he shouted for a guard ser meryn trant stepped into the room tall and somber in his white armor the queen is tired see her to her bedchamber the knight helped cersei to her feet and led her out without a word robert reached for the flagon and refilled his cup you see what she does to me ned the king seated himself cradling his wine cup my loving wife the mother of my children the rage was gone from him now in his eyes ned saw something sad and scared i should not have hit her that was not that was not kingly he stared down at his hands as if he did not quite know what they were i was always strong no one could stand before me no one how do you fight someone if you cant hit them confused the king shook his head rhaegar rhaegar won damn him i killed him ned i drove the spike right through that black armor into his black heart and he died at my feet they made up songs about it yet somehow he still won he has lyanna now and i have her the king drained his cup your grace ned stark said we must talk robert pressed his fingertips against his temples i am sick unto death of talk on the morrow im going to the kingswood to hunt whatever you have to say can wait until i return if the gods are good i shall not be here on your return you commanded me to return to winterfell remember robert stood up grasping one of the bedposts to steady himself the gods are seldom good ned here this is yours he pulled the heavy silver hand clasp from a pocket in the lining of his cloak and tossed it on the bed like it or not you are my hand damn you i forbid you to leave ned picked up the silver clasp he was being given no choice it seemed his leg throbbed and he felt as helpless as a child the targaryen girl the king groaned seven hells dont start with her again thats done ill hear no more of it why would you want me as your hand if you refuse to listen to my counsel why robert laughed why not someone has to rule this damnable kingdom put on the badge ned it suits you and if you ever throw it in my face again i swear to you ill pin the damned thing on jaime lannister catelyn the eastern sky was rose and gold as the sun broke over the vale of arryn catelyn stark watched the light spread her hands resting on the delicate carved stone of the balustrade outside her window below her the world turned from black to indigo to green as dawn crept across fields and forests pale white mists rose off alyssas tears where the ghost waters plunged over the shoulder of the mountain to begin their long tumble down the face of the giants lance catelyn could feel the faint touch of spray on her face page alyssa arryn had seen her husband her brothers and all her children slain and yet in life she had never shed a tear so in death the gods had decreed that she would know no rest until her weeping watered the black earth of the vale where the men she had loved were buried alyssa had been dead six thousand years now and still no drop of the torrent had ever reached the valley floor far below catelyn wondered how large a waterfall her own tears would make when she died tell me the rest of it she said the kingslayer is massing a host at casterly rock ser rodrik cassel answered from the room behind her your brother writes that he has sent riders to the rock demanding that lord tywin proclaim his intent but he has had no answer edmure has commanded lord vance and lord piper to guard the pass below the golden tooth he vows to you that he will yield no foot of tully land without first watering it with lannister blood catelyn turned away from the sunrise its beauty did little to lighten her mood it seemed cruel for a day to dawn so fair and end so foul as this one promised to edmure has sent riders and made vows she said but edmure is not the lord of riverrun what of my lord father the message made no mention of lord hoster my lady ser rodrik tugged at his whiskers they had grown in white as snow and bristly as a thornbush while he was recovering from his wounds he looked almost himself again my father would not have given the defense of riverrun over to edmure unless he was very sick she said worried i should have been woken as soon as this bird arrived your lady sister thought it better to let you sleep maester colemon told me a should have been woken she insisted the maester tells me your sister planned to speak with you after the combat ser rodrik said then she still plans to go through with this mummers farce catelyn grimaced the dwarf has played her like a set of pipes and she is too deaf to hear the tune whatever happens this morning ser rodrik it is past time we took our leave my place is at winterfell with my sons if you are strong enough to travel i shall ask lysa for an escort to see us to gulltown we can take ship from there another ship ser rodrik looked a shade green yet he managed not to shudder as you say my lady the old knight waited outside her door as catelyn summoned the servants lysa had given her if she spoke to her sister before the duel perhaps she could change her mind she thought as they dressed her lysas policies varied with her moods and her moods changed hourly the shy girl she had known at riverrun had grown into a woman who was by turns proud fearful cruel dreamy reckless timid stubborn vain and above all inconstant when that vile turnkey of hers had come crawling to tell them that tyrion lannister wished to confess catelyn had urged lysa to have the dwarf brought to them privately but no nothing would do but that her sister must make a show of him before half the vale and now this page lannister is my prisoner she told ser rodrik as they descended the tower stairs and made their way through the eyries cold white halls catelyn wore plain grey wool with a silvered belt my sister must be reminded of that at the doors to lysas apartments they met her uncle storming out going to join the fools festival ser brynden snapped id tell you to slap some sense into your sister if i thought it would do any good but youd only bruise your hand there was a bird from riverrun catelyn began a letter from edmure i know child the black fish that fastened his cloak was bryndens only concession to ornament i had to hear it from maester colemon i asked your sister for leave to take a thousand seasoned men and ride for riverrun with all haste do you know what she told me the vale cannot spare a thousand swords nor even one uncle she said you are the knight of the gate your place is here a gust of childish laughter drifted through the open doors behind him and her uncle glanced darkly over his shoulder well i told her she could bloody well find herself a new knight of the gate black fish or no i am still a tully i shall leave for riverrun by evenfall catelyn could not pretend to surprise alone you know as well as i that you will never survive the high road ser rodrik and i are returning to winterfell come with us uncle i will give you your thousand men riverrun will not fight alone brynden thought a moment then nodded a brusque agreement as you say its the long way home but im more like to get there ill wait for you below he went striding off his cloak swirling behind him catelyn exchanged a look with ser rodrik they went through the doors to the high nervous sound of a childs giggles lysas apartments opened over a small garden a circle of dirt and grass planted with blue flowers and ringed on all sides by tall white towers the builders had intended it as a godswood but the eyrie rested on the hard stone of the mountain and no matter how much soil was hauled up from the vale they could not get a weirwood to take root here so the lords of the eyrie planted grass and scattered statuary amidst low flowering shrubs it was there the two champions would meet to place their lives and that of tyrion lannister into the hands of the gods lysa freshly scrubbed and garbed in cream velvet with a rope of sapphires and moonstones around her milkwhite neck was holding court on the terrace overlooking the scene of the combat surrounded by her knights retainers and lords high and low most of them still hoped to wed her bed her and rule the vale of arryn by her side from what catelyn had seen during her stay at the eyrie it was a vain hope a wooden platform had been built to elevate roberts chair there the lord of the eyrie sat giggling and clapping his hands as a humpbacked puppeteer in blueandwhite motley made two wooden knights hack and slash at each other pitchers of thick cream and baskets of blackberries had been set out and page the guests were sipping a sweet orangescented wine from engraved silver cups a fools festival brynden had called it and small wonder across the terrace lysa laughed gaily at some jest of lord hunters and nibbled a blackberry from the point of ser lyn corbrays dagger they were the suitors who stood highest in lysas favor today at least catelyn would have been hardpressed to say which man was more unsuitable eon hunter was even older than jon arryn had been halfcrippled by gout and cursed with three quarrelsome sons each more grasping than the last ser lyn was a different sort of folly lean and handsome heir to an ancient but impoverished house but vain reckless hottempered and it was whispered notoriously uninterested in the intimate charms of women when lysa espied catelyn she welcomed her with a sisterly embrace and a moist kiss on the cheek isnt it a lovely morning the gods are smiling on us do try a cup of the wine sweet sister lord hunter was kind enough to send for it from his own cellars thank you no lysa we must talk after her sister promised already beginning to turn away from her now catelyn spoke more loudly than shed intended men were turning to look lysa you cannot mean to go ahead with this folly alive the imp has value dead he is only food for crows and if his champion should prevail here small chance of that my lady lord hunter assured her patting her shoulder with a liverspotted hand ser vardis is a doughty fighter he will make short work of the sellsword will he my lord catelyn said coolly i wonder she had seen bronn fight on the high road it was no accident that he had survived the journey while other men had died he moved like a panther and that ugly sword of his seemed a part of his arm lysas suitors were gathering around them like bees round a blossom women understand little of these things ser morton waynwood said ser vardis is a knight sweet lady this other fellow well his sort are all cowards at heart useful enough in a battle with thousands of their fellows around them but stand them up alone and the manhood leaks right out of them say you have the truth of it then catelyn said with a courtesy that made her mouth ache what will we gain by the dwarfs death do you imagine that jaime will care a fig that we gave his brother a trial before we flung him off a mountain behead the man ser lyn corbray suggested when the kingslayer receives the imps head it will be a warning to him lysa gave an impatient shake of her waistlong auburn hair lord robert wants to see him fly she said as if that settled the matter and the imp has only himself to blame it was he who demanded a trial by combat lady lysa had no honorable way to deny him even if shed wished to lord hunter intoned page ponderously ignoring them all catelyn turned all her force on her sister i remind you tyrion lannister is my prisoner and i remind you the dwarf murdered my lord husband her voice rose he poisoned the hand of the king and left my sweet baby fatherless and now i mean to see him pay whirling her skirts swinging around her lysa stalked across the terrace ser lyn and ser morton and the other suitors excused themselves with cool nods and trailed after her do you think he did ser rodrik asked her quietly when they were alone again murder lord jon that is the imp still denies it and most fiercely i believe the lannisters murdered lord arryn catelyn replied but whether it was tyrion or ser jaime or the queen or all of them together i could not begin to say lysa had named cersei in the letter she had sent to winterfell but now she seemed certain that tyrion was the killer perhaps because the dwarf was here while the queen was safe behind the walls of the red keep hundreds of leagues to the south catelyn almost wished she had burned her sisters letter before reading it ser rodrik tugged at his whiskers poison well that could be the dwarf s work true enough or cerseis its said poison is a womans weapon begging your pardons my lady the kingslayer now i have no great liking for the man but hes not the sort too fond of the sight of blood on that golden sword of his was it poison my lady catelyn frowned vaguely uneasy how else could they make it look a natural death behind her lord robert shrieked with delight as one of the puppet knights sliced the other in half spilling a flood of red sawdust onto the terrace she glanced at her nephew and sighed the boy is utterly without discipline he will never be strong enough to rule unless he is taken away from his mother for a time his lord father agreed with you said a voice at her elbow she turned to behold maester colemon a cup of wine in his hand he was planning to send the boy to dragonstone for fostering you know oh but im speaking out of turn the apple of his throat bobbed anxiously beneath the loose maesters chain i fear ive had too much of lord hunters excellent wine the prospect of bloodshed has my nerves all afray you are mistaken maester catelyn said it was casterly rock not dragonstone and those arrangements were made after the hands death without my sisters consent the maesters head jerked so vigorously at the end of his absurdly long neck that he looked half a puppet himself no begging your forgiveness my lady but it was lord jon who a bell tolled loudly below them high lords and serving girls alike broke off what they were doing and moved to the balustrade below two guardsmen in skyblue cloaks led forth tyrion lannister the eyries plump septon escorted him to the statue in the center of the garden a weeping woman carved in veined white marble no doubt meant to be alyssa the bad little man lord robert said giggling mother can i make him fly i want to see him fly page later my sweet baby lysa promised him trial first drawled ser lyn corbray then execution a moment later the two champions appeared from opposite sides of the garden the knight was attended by two young squires the sellsword by the eyries masteratarms ser vardis egen was steel from head to heel encased in heavy plate armor over mail and padded surcoat large circular rondels enameled creamandblue in the moonandfalcon sigil of house arryn protected the vulnerable juncture of arm and breast a skirt of lobstered metal covered him from waist to midthigh while a solid gorget encircled his throat falcons wings sprouted from the temples of his helm and his visor was a pointed metal beak with a narrow slit for vision bronn was so lightly armored he looked almost naked beside the knight he wore only a shirt of black oiled ringmail over boiled leather a round steel halfhelm with a noseguard and a mail coif high leather boots with steel shinguards gave some protection to his legs and discs of black iron were sewn into the fingers of his gloves yet catelyn noted that the sellsword stood half a hand taller than his foe with a a came of thrones longer reach and bronn was fifteen years younger if she was any judge they knelt in the grass beneath the weeping woman facing each other with lannister between them the septon removed a faceted crystal sphere from the soft cloth bag at his waist he lifted it high above his head and the light shattered rainbows danced across the imps face in a high solemn singsong voice the septon asked the gods to look down and bear witness to find the truth in this mans soul to grant him life and freedom if he was innocent death if he was guilty his voice echoed off the surrounding towers when the last echo had died away the septon lowered his crystal and made a hasty departure tyrion leaned over and whispered something in bronns ear before the guardsmen led him away the sellsword rose laughing and brushed a blade of grass from his knee robert arryn lord of the eyrie and defender of the vale was fidgeting impatiently in his elevated chair when are they going to fight he asked plaintively ser vardis was helped back to his feet by one of his squires the other brought him a triangular shield almost four feet tall heavy oak dotted with iron studs they strapped it to his left forearm when lysas masteratarms offered brorm a similar shield the sellsword spat and waved it away three days growth of coarse black beard covered his jaw and cheeks but if he did not shave it was not for want of a razor the edge of his sword had the dangerous glimmer of steel that had been honed every day for hours until it was too sharp to touch ser vardis held out a gauntleted hand and his squire placed a handsome doubleedged longsword in his grasp the blade was engraved with a delicate silver tracery of a mountain sky its pommel was a falcons head its crossguard fashioned into the shape of wings i had that sword crafted for jon in kings landing lysa told her guests proudly as they watched ser vardis try a practice cut he wore it whenever he sat the iron throne in king roberts place isnt it a lovely thing i thought it only fitting that our champion avenge jon with his own blade page the engraved silver blade was beautiful beyond a doubt but it seemed to catelyn that ser vardis might have been more comfortable with his own sword yet she said nothing she was weary of futile arguments with her sister make them fight lord robert called out ser vardis faced the lord of the eyrie and lifted his sword in salute for the eyrie and the vale tyrion lannister had been seated on a balcony across the garden flanked by his guards it was to him that bronn turned with a cursory salute they await your command lady lysa said to her lord son fight the boy screamed his arms trembling as they clutched at his chair ser vardis swiveled bringing up his heavy shield bronn turned to face him their swords rang together once twice a testing the sellsword backed off a step the knight came after holding his shield before him he tried a slash but bronn jerked back just out of reach and the silver blade cut only air bronn circled to his right ser vardis turned to follow keeping his shield between them the knight pressed forward placing each foot carefully on the uneven ground the sellsword gave way a faint smile playing over his lips ser vardis attacked slashing but bronn leapt away from him hopping lightly over a low mosscovered stone now the sellsword circled left away from the shield toward the knights unprotected side ser vardis tried a hack at his legs but he did not have the reach bronn danced farther to his left ser vardis turned in place the man is craven lord hunter declared stand and fight coward other voices echoed the sentiment catelyn looked to ser rodrik her masteratarms gave a curt shake of his head he wants to make ser vardis chase him the weight of armor and shield will tire even the strongest man she had seen men practice at their swordplay near every day of her life had viewed half a hundred tourneys in her time but this was something different and deadlier a dance where the smallest misstep meant death and as she watched the memory of another duel in another time came back to catelyn stark as vivid as if it had been yesterday they met in the lower bailey of riverrun when brandon saw that petyr wore only helm and breastplate and mail he took off most of his armor petyr had begged her for a favor he might wear but she had turned him away her lord father promised her to brandon stark and so it was to him that she gave her token a pale blue handscarf she had embroidered with the leaping trout of riverrun as she pressed it into his hand she pleaded with him he is only a foolish boy but i have loved him like a brother it would grieve me to see him die and her betrothed looked at her with the cool grey eyes of a stark and promised to spare the boy who loved her that fight was over almost as soon as it began brandon was a man grown and he drove littlefinger all the way across the bailey and down page the water stair raining steel on him with every step until the boy was staggering and bleeding from a dozen wounds yield he called more than once but petyr would only shake his head and fight on grimly when the river was lapping at their ankles brandon finally ended it with a brutal backhand cut that bit through petyrs rings and leather into the soft flesh below the ribs so deep that catelyn was certain that the wound was mortal he looked at her as he fell and murmured cat as the bright blood came flowing out between his mailed fingers she thought she had forgotten that that was the last time she had seen his face until the day she was brought before him in kings landing a fortnight passed before littlefinger was strong enough to leave riverrun but her lord father forbade her to visit him in the tower where he lay abed lysa helped their maester nurse him she had been softer and shyer in those days edmure had called on him as well but petyr had sent him away her brother had acted as brandons squire at the duel and littlefinger would not forgive that as soon as he was strong enough to be moved lord hoster tully sent petyr baelish away in a closed litter to finish his healing on the fingers upon the windswept jut of rock where hed been born the ringing clash of steel on steel jarred catelyn back to the present ser vardis was coming hard at bronn driving into him with shield and sword the sellsword scrambled backward checking each blow stepping lithely over rock and root his eyes never leaving his foe he was quicker catelyn saw the knights silvered sword never came near to touching him but his own ugly grey blade hacked a notch from ser vardiss shoulder plate the brief flurry of fighting ended as swiftly as it had begun when bronn sidestepped and slid behind the statue of the weeping woman ser vardis lunged at where he had been striking a spark off the pate marble of alyssas thigh theyre not fighting good mother the lord of the eyrie complained i want them to fight they will sweet baby his mother soothed him the sellsword cant run all day some of the lords on lysas terrace were making wry jests as they refilled their wine cups but across the garden tyrion lannisters mismatched eyes watched the champions dance as if there were nothing else in the world bronn came out from behind the statue hard and fast still moving left aiming a twohanded cut at the knights unshielded right side ser vardis blocked but clumsily and the sellswords blade flashed upward at his head metal rang and a falcons wing collapsed with a crunch ser vardis took a half step back to brace himself raised his shield oak chips flew as bronns sword hacked at the wooden wall the sellsword stepped left again away from the shield and caught ser vardis across the stomach the razor edge of his blade leaving a bright gash when it bit into the knights plate ser vardis drove forward off his back foot his own silver blade descending in a savage arc bronn slammed it aside and danced away the knight crashed into the weeping woman rocking her on her plinth staggered he stepped backward his head turning this way and that as he searched for his foe the slit visor of his helm narrowed his vision behind you ser lord hunter shouted too late bronn brought his sword down with both hands page catching ser vardis in the elbow of his sword arm the thin lobstered metal that protected the joint crunched the knight grunted turning wrenching his weapon up this time bronn stood his ground the swords flew at each other and their steel song filled the garden and rang off the white towers of the eyrie ser vardis is hurt ser rodrik said his voice grave catelyn did not need to be told she had eyes she could see the bright finger of blood running along the knights forearm the wetness inside the elbow joint every parry was a little slower and a little lower than the one before ser vardis turned his side to his foe trying to use his shield to block instead but bronn slid around him quick as a cat the sellsword seemed to be getting stronger his cuts were leaving their marks now deep shiny gashes gleamed all over the knights armor on his right thigh his beaked visor crossing on his breastplate a long one along the front of his gorget the moonandfalcon rondel over ser vardiss right arm was sheared clean in half hanging by its strap they could hear his labored breath rattling through the air holes in his visor blind with arrogance as they were even the knights and lords of the vale could see what was happening below them yet her sister could not enough ser vardis lady lysa called down finish him now my baby is growing tired and it must be said of ser vardis egen that he was true to his ladys command even to the last one moment he was reeling backward halfcrouched behind his scarred shield the next he charged the sudden bull rush caught bronn off balance ser vardis crashed into him and slammed the lip of his shield into the sellswords face almost almost bronn lost his feet he staggered back tripped over a rock and caught hold of the weeping woman to keep his balance throwing aside his shield ser vardis lurched after him using both hands to raise his sword his right arm was blood from elbow to fingers now yet his last desperate blow would have opened bronn from neck to navel if the sellsword had stood to receive it but bronn jerked back jon arryns beautiful engraved silver sword glanced off the marble elbow of the weeping woman and snapped clean a third of the way up the blade bronn put his shoulder into the statues back the weathered likeness of alyssa arryn tottered and fell with a great crash and ser vardis egen went down beneath her bronn was on him in a heartbeat kicking what was left of his shattered rondel aside to expose the weak spot between arm and breastplate ser vardis was lying on his side pinned beneath the broken torso of the weeping woman catelyn heard the knight groan as the sellsword lifted his blade with both hands and drove it down and in with all his weight behind it under the arm and through the ribs ser vardis egen shuddered and lay still silence hung over the eyrie bronn yanked off his halfhelm and let it fall to the grass his lip was smashed and bloody where the shield had caught him and his coalblack hair was soaked with sweat he spit out a broken tooth is it over mother the lord of the eyrie asked no catelyn wanted to tell him its only now beginning page yes lysa said glumly her voice as cold and dead as the captain of her guard can i make the little man fly now across the garden tyrion lannister got to his feet not this little man he said this little man is going down in the turnip hoist thank you very much you presume lysa began i presume that house arryn remembers its own words the imp said as high as honor you promised i could make him fly the lord of the eyrie screamed at his mother he began to shake lady lysas face was flushed with fury the gods have seen fit to proclaim him innocent child we have no choice but to free him she lifted her voice guards take my lord of lannister and his creature here out of my sight escort them to the bloody gate and set them free see that they have horses and supplies sufficient to reach the trident and make certain all their goods and weapons are returned to them they shall need them on the high road the high road tyrion lannister said lysa allowed herself a faint satisfied smile it was another sort of death sentence catelyn realized tyrion lannister must know that as well yet the dwarf favored lady arryn with a mocking bow as you command my lady he said i believe we know the way jon you are as hopeless as any boys i have ever trained ser alliser thorne announced when they had all assembled in the yard your hands were made for manure shovels not for swords and if it were up to me the lot of you would be set to herding swine but last night i was told that gueren is marching five new boys up the kingsroad one or two may even be worth the price of piss to make room for them i have decided to pass eight of you on to the lord commander to do with as he will he called out the names one by one toad stone head aurochs lover pimple monkey ser loon last he looked at jon and the bastard pyp let fly a whoop and thrust his sword into the air ser alliser fixed him with a reptile stare they will call you men of nights watch now but you are bigger fools than the mummers monkey here if you believe that you are boys still green and stinking of summer and when the winter comes you will die like flies and with that ser alliser thorne took his leave of them the other boys gathered round the eight who had been named laughing and cursing and offering congratulations halder smacked toad on the butt with the flat of his sword and shouted toad of the nights watch yelling that a black brother needed a horse pyp leapt onto grenns shoulders and they tumbled to the ground rolling and punching and hooting dareon dashed inside the armory and returned with a skin of sour red as they passed the wine from hand to hand grinning like fools jon noticed samwell tarly standing by himself beneath a bare dead tree in the corner of the yard jon offered him the page skin a swallow of wine sam shook his head no thank you jon are you well very well truly the fat boy lied i am so happy for you all his round face quivered as he forced a smile you will be first ranger someday just as your uncle was is jon corrected he would not accept that benjen stark was dead before he could say more haider cried here you planning to drink that all yourself pyp snatched the skin from his hand and danced away laughing while grenn seized his arm pyp gave the skin a squeeze and a thin stream of red squirted jon in the face haider howled in protest at the waste of good wine jon sputtered and struggled matthar and jeren climbed the wall and began pelting them all with snowballs by the time he wrenched free with snow in his hair and wine stains on his surcoat samwell tarly had gone that night threefinger hobb cooked the boys a special meal to mark the occasion when jon arrived at the common hall the lord steward himself led him to the bench near the fire the older men clapped him on the arm in passing the eight soontobe brothers feasted on rack of lamb baked in a crust of garlic and herbs garnished with sprigs of mint and surrounded by mashed yellow turnips swimming in butter from the lord commanders own table bowen marsh told them there were salads of spinach and chickpeas and turnip greens and afterward bowls of iced blueberries and sweet cream do you think theyll keep us together pyp wondered as they gorged themselves happily toad made a face i hope not im sick of looking at those ears of yours ho said pyp listen to the crow call the raven black youre certain to be a ranger toad theyll want you as far from the castle as they can if mance rayder attacks lift your visor and show your face and hell run off screaming everyone laughed but grenn i hope im a ranger you and everyone else said matthar every man who wore the black walked the wall and every man was expected to take up steel in its defense but the rangers were the true fighting heart of the nights watch it was they who dared ride beyond the wall sweeping through the haunted forest and the icy mountain heights west of the shadow tower fighting wildlings and giants and monstrous snow bears not everyone said halder its the builders for me what use would rangers be if the wall fell down the order of builders provided the masons and carpenters to repair keeps and towers the miners to dig tunnels and crush stone for roads and footpaths the woodsmen to clear away new growth wherever the forest pressed too close to the wall once it was said they had quarried immense blocks of ice from frozen lakes deep in the haunted forest dragging them south on sledges so the wall might be raised ever higher those days were centuries gone however now it was all they could do to ride the wall from page eastwatch to the shadow tower watching for cracks or signs of melt and making what repairs they could the old bears no fool dareon observed youre certain to be a builder and jons certain to be a ranger hes the best sword and the best rider among us and his uncle was the first before he his voice trailed off awkwardly as he realized what he had almost said benjen stark is still first ranger jon snow told him toying with his bowl of blueberries the rest might have given up all hope of his uncles safe return but not him he pushed away the berries scarcely touched and rose from the bench arent you going to eat those toad asked theyre yours jon had hardly tasted hobbs great feast i could not eat another bite he took his cloak from its hook near the door and shouldered his way out pyp followed him jon what is it sam he admitted he was not at table tonight its not like him to miss a meal pyp said thoughtfully do you suppose hes taken ill hes frightened were leaving him he remembered the day he had left winterfell all the bittersweet farewells bran lying broken robb with snow in his hair arya raining kisses on him after hed given her needle once we say our words well all have duties to attend to some of us may be sent away to eastwatch or the shadow tower sam will remain in training with the likes of rast and cuger and these new boys who are coming up the kingsroad gods only know what theyll be like but you can bet ser alliser will send them against him first chance he gets pyp made a grimace you did all you could all we could wasnt enough jon said a deep restlessness was on him as he went back to hardins tower for ghost the direwolf walked beside him to the stables some of the more skittish horses kicked at their stalls and laid back their ears as they entered jon saddled his mare mounted and rode out from castle black south across the moonlit night ghost raced ahead of him flying over the ground gone in the blink of an eye jon let him go a wolf needed to hunt he had no destination in mind he wanted only to ride he followed the creek for a time listening to the icy trickle of water over rock then cut across the fields to the kingsroad it stretched out before him narrow and stony and pocked with weeds a road of no particular promise yet the sight of it filled jon snow with a vast longing winterfell was down that road and beyond it riverrun and kings landing and the eyrie and so many other places casterly rock the isles of faces the red mountains of dorne the hundred islands of braavos in the sea the smoking ruins of old valyria all the places that jon would never see the world was down that road and he was here once he swore his vow the wall would be his home until he was old as maester aemon i have not page sworn yet he muttered he was no outlaw bound to take the black or pay the penalty for his crimes he had come here freely and he might leave freely until he said the words he need only ride on and he could leave it all behind by the time the moon was full again he would be back in winterfell with his brothers your half brothers a voice inside reminded him and lady stark who will not welcome you there was no place for him in winterfell no place in kings landing either even his own mother had not had a place for him the thought of her made him sad he wondered who she had been what she had looked like why his father had left her because she was a whore or an adulteress fool something dark and dishonorable or else why was lord eddard too ashamed to speak of her jon snow turned away from the kingsroad to look behind him the fires of castle black were hidden behind a hill but the wall was there pale beneath the moon vast and cold running from horizon to horizon he wheeled his horse around and started for home ghost returned as he crested a rise and saw the distant glow of lamplight from the lord commanders tower the direwolf s muzzle was red with blood as he trotted beside the horse jon found himself thinking of samwell tarly again on the ride back by the time he reached the stables he knew what he must do maester aemons apartments were in a stout wooden keep below the rookery aged and frail the maester shared his chambers with two of the younger stewards who tended to his needs and helped him in his duties the brothers joked that he had been given the two ugliest men in the nights watch being blind he was spared having to look at them clydas was short bald and chinless with small pink eyes like a mole chett had a wen on his neck the size of a pigeons egg and a face red with boils and pimples perhaps that was why he always seemed so angry it was chett who answered jons knock i need to speak to maester aemon jon told him the maester is abed as you should be come back on the morrow and maybe hell see you he began to shut the door jon jammed it open with his boot i need to speak to him now the morning will be too late chett scowled the maester is not accustomed to being woken in the night do you know how old he is old enough to treat visitors with more courtesy than you jon said give him my pardons i would not disturb his rest if it were not important and if i refuse jon had his boot wedged solidly in the door i can stand here all night if i must the black brother made a disgusted noise and opened the door to admit him wait in the library page theres wood start a fire i wont have the maester catching a chill on account of you jon had the logs crackling merrily by the time chett led in maester aemon the old man was clad in his bed robe but around his throat was the chain collar of his order a maester did not remove it even to sleep the chair beside the fire would be pleasant he said when he felt the warmth on his face when he was settled comfortably chett covered his legs with a fur and went to stand by the door i am sorry to have woken you maester jon snow said you did not wake me maester aemon replied i find i need less sleep as i grow older and i am grown very old i often spend half the night with ghosts remembering times fifty years past as if they were yesterday the mystery of a midnight visitor is a welcome diversion so tell me jon snow why have you come calling at this strange hour to ask that samwell tarly be taken from training and accepted as a brother of the nights watch this is no concern of maester aemon chett complained our lord commander has given the training of recruits into the hands of ser alliser thorne the maester said gently only he may say when a boy is ready to swear his vow as you surely know why then come to me the lord commander listens to you jon told him and the wounded and the sick of the nights watch are in your charge and is your friend samwell wounded or sick he will be jon promised unless you help he told them all of it even the part where hed set ghost at rasts throat maester aemon listened silently blind eyes fixed on the fire but chetts face darkened with each word without us to keep him safe sam will have no chance jon finished hes hopeless with a sword my sister arya could tear him apart and shes not yet ten if ser alliser makes him fight its only a matter of time before hes hurt or killed chett could stand no more ive seen this fat boy in the common hall he said he is a pig and a hopeless craven as well if what you say is true maybe it is so maester aemon said tell me chett what would you have us do with such a boy leave him where he is chett said the wall is no place for the weak let him train until he is ready no matter how many years that takes ser alliser shall make a man of him or kill him as the gods will thats stupid jon said he took a deep breath to gather his thoughts i remember once i asked maester luwin why he wore a chain around his throat maester aemon touched his own collar lightly his bony wrinkled finger stroking the heavy metal links go on page he told me that a maesters collar is made of chain to remind him that he is sworn to serve jon said remembering i asked why each link was a different metal a silver chain would look much finer with his grey robes i said maester luwin laughed a maester forges his chain with study he told me the different metals are each a different kind of learning gold for the study of money and accounts silver for healing iron for warcraft and he said there were other meanings as well the collar is supposed to remind a maester of the realm he serves isnt that so lords are gold and knights steel but two links cant make a chain you also need silver and iron and lead tin and copper and bronze and all the rest and those are farmers and smiths and merchants and the like a chain needs all sorts of metals and a land needs all sorts of people maester aemon smiled and so the nights watch needs all sorts too why else have rangers and stewards and builders lord randyll couldnt make sam a warrior and ser alliser wont either you cant hammer tin into iron no matter how hard you beat it but that doesnt mean tin is useless why shouldnt sam be a steward chett gave an angry scowl im a steward you think its easy work fit for cowards the order of stewards keeps the watch alive we hunt and farm tend the horses milk the cows gather firewood cook the meals who do you think makes your clothing who brings up supplies from the south the stewards maester aemon was gentler is your friend a hunter he hates hunting jon had to admit can he plow a field the maester asked can he drive a wagon or sail a ship could he butcher a cow no chett gave a nasty laugh ive seen what happens to soft lordlings when theyre put to work set them to churning butter and their hands blister and bleed give them an axe to split logs and they cut off their own foot i know one thing sam could do better than anyone yes maester aemon prompted jon glanced warily at chett standing beside the door his boils red and angry he could help you he said quickly he can do sums and he knows how to read and write i know chett cant read and clydas has weak eyes sam read every book in his fathers library hed be good with the ravens too animals seem to like him ghost took to him straight off theres a lot he could do besides fighting the nights watch needs every man why kill one to no end make use of him instead maester aemon closed his eyes and for a brief moment jon was afraid that he had gone to sleep finally he said maester luwin taught you well jon snow your mind is as deft as your blade it would page seem does that mean t it means i shall think on what you have said the maester told him firmly and now i believe i am ready to sleep chett show our young brother to the door tyrion they had taken shelter beneath a copse of aspens just off the high road tyrion was gathering deadwood while their horses took water from a mountain stream he stooped to pick up a splintered branch and examined it critically will this do i am not practiced at starting fires morrec did that for me afire bronn said spitting are you so hungry to die dwarf or have you taken leave of your senses a fire will bring the clansmen down on us from miles around i mean to survive this journey lannister and how do you hope to do that tyrion asked he tucked the branch under his arm and poked around through the sparse undergrowth looking for more his back ached from the effort of bending they had been riding since daybreak when a stonefaced ser lyn corbray had ushered them through the bloody gate and commanded them never to return we have no chance of fighting our way back bronn said but two can cover more ground than ten and attract less notice the fewer days we spend in these mountains the more like we are to reach the riverlands ride hard and fast i say travel by night and hole up by day avoid the road where we can make no noise and light no fires tyrion lannister sighed a splendid plan bronn try it as you like and forgive me if i do not linger to bury you you think to outlive me dwarf the sellsword grinned he had a dark gap in his smile where the edge of ser vardis egens shield had cracked a tooth in half tyrion shrugged riding hard and fast by night is a sure way to tumble down a mountain and crack your skull i prefer to make my crossing slow and easy i know you love the taste of horse bronn but if our mounts die under us this time well be trying to saddle shadowcats and if truth be told i think the clans will find us no matter what we do their eyes are all around us he swept a gloved hand over the high windcarved crags that surrounded them bronn grimaced then were dead men lannister if so i prefer to die comfortable tyrion replied we need a fire the nights are cold up here and hot food will warm our bellies and lift our spirits do you suppose theres any game to be had lady lysa has kindly provided us with a veritable feast of salt beef hard cheese and stale bread but i would hate to break a tooth so far from the nearest maester i can find meat beneath a fall of black hair bronns dark eyes regarded tyrion suspiciously i should page leave you here with your fools fire if i took your horse id have twice the chance to make it through what would you do then dwarf die most like tyrion stooped to get another stick you dont think id do it youd do it in an instant if it meant your life you were quick enough to silence your friend chiggen when he caught that arrow in his belly bronn had yanked back the mans head by the hair and driven the point of his dirk in under the ear and afterward told catelyn stark that the other sellsword had died of his wound he was good as dead bronn said and his moaning was bringing them down on us chiggen would have done the same for me and he was no friend only a man i rode with make no mistake dwarf i fought for you but i do not love you it was your blade i needed tyrion said not your love he dumped his armful of wood on the ground bronn grinned youre bold as any sellsword ill give you that how did you know id take your part know tyrion squatted awkwardly on his stunted legs to build the fire i tossed the dice back at the inn you and chiggen helped take me captive why the others saw it as their duty for the honor of the lords they served but not you two you had no lord no duty and precious little honor so why trouble to involve yourselves he took out his knife and whittled some thin strips of bark off one of the sticks hed gathered to serve as kindling well why do sellswords do anything for gold you were thinking lady catelyn would reward you for your help perhaps even take you into her service here that should do i hope do you have a flint bronn slid two fingers into the pouch at his belt and tossed down a flint tyrion caught it in the air my thanks he said the thing is you did not know the starks lord eddard is a proud honorable and honest man and his lady wife is worse oh no doubt she would have found a coin or two for you when this was all over and pressed it in your hand with a polite word and a look of distaste but thats the most you could have hoped for the starks look for courage and loyalty and honor in the men they choose to serve them and if truth be told you and chiggen were lowborn scum tyrion struck the flint against his dagger trying for a spark nothing bronn snorted you have a bold tongue little man one day someone is like to cut it out and make you eat it everyone tells me that tyrion glanced up at the sellsword did i offend you my pardons but you are scum bronn make no mistake duty honor friendship whats that to you no dont trouble yourself we both know the answer still youre not stupid once we reached the vale lady stark had no more need of you but i did and the one thing the lannisters have never lacked for is gold when the moment came to toss the dice i was counting on your being smart enough to know where your best interest lay happily for me you did he slammed stone and steel together again fruitlessly page here said bronn squatting ill do it he took the knife and flint from tyrions hands and struck sparks on his first try a curl of bark began to smolder well done tyrion said scum you may be but youre undeniably useful and with a sword in your hand youre almost as good as my brother jaime what do you want bronn gold land women keep me alive and youll have it bronn blew gently on the fire and the flames leapt up higher and if you die why then ill have one mourner whose grief is sincere tyrion said grinning the gold ends when i do the fire was blazing up nicely bronn stood tucked the flint back into his pouch and tossed tyrion his dagger fair enough he said my swords yours then but dont go looking for me to bend the knee and mord you every time you take a shit im no mans toady nor any mans friend tyrion said ive no doubt youd betray me as quick as you did lady stark if you saw a profit in it if the day ever comes when youre tempted to sell me out remember this bronnill match their price whatever it is i like living and now do you think you could do something about finding us some supper take care of the horses bronn said unsheathing the long dirk he wore at his hip he strode into the trees an hour later the horses had been rubbed down and fed the fire was crackling away merrily and a haunch of a young goat was turning above the flames spitting and hissing all we lack now is some good wine to wash down our kid tyrion said that a woman and another dozen swords bronn said he sat crosslegged beside the fire honing the edge of his longsword with an oilstone there was something strangely reassuring about the rasping sound it made when he drew it down the steel it will be full dark soon the sellsword pointed out ill take first watch for all the good it will do us it might be kinder to let them kill us in our sleep oh i imagine theyll be here long before it comes to sleep the smell of the roasting meat made tyrions mouth water bronn watched him across the fire you have a plan he said flatly with a scrape of steel on stone a hope call it tyrion said another toss of the dice with our lives as the stake tyrion shrugged what choice do we have he leaned over the fire and sawed a thin slice of meat from the kid ahhhh he sighed happily as he chewed grease ran down his chin a bit tougher than id like and in want of spicing but ill not complain too loudly if i were back at the eyrie id be dancing on a precipice in hopes of a boiled bean and yet you gave the turnkey a purse of gold bronn said page a lannister always pays his debts even mord had scarcely believed it when tyrion tossed him the leather purse the gaolers eyes had gone big as boiled eggs as he yanked open the drawstring and beheld the glint of gold i kept the silver tyrion had told him with a crooked smile but you were promised the gold and there it is it was more than a man like mord could hope to earn in a lifetime of abusing prisoners and remember what i said this is only a taste if you ever grow tired of lady arryns service present yourself at casterly rock and ill pay you the rest of what i owe you with golden dragons spilling out of both hands mord had fallen to his knees and promised that he would do just that bronn yanked out his dirk and pulled the meat from the fire he began to carve thick chunks of charred meat off the bone as tyrion george rr marun hollowed out two heels of stale bread to serve as trenchers if we do reach the river what will you do then the sellsword asked as he cut oh a whore and a featherbed and a flagon of wine for a start tyrion held out his trencher and bronn filled it with meat and then to casterly rock or kings landing i think i have some questions that want answering concerning a certain dagger the sellsword chewed and swallowed so you were telling it true it was not your knife tyrion smiled thinly do i look a liar to you by the time their bellies were full the stars had come out and a halfmoon was rising over the mountains tyrion spread his shadowskin cloak on the ground and stretched out with his saddle for a pillow our friends are taking their sweet time if i were them id fear a trap bronn said why else would we be so open if not to lure them in tyrion chuckled then we ought to sing and send them fleeing in terror he began to whistle a tune youre mad dwarf bronn said as he cleaned the grease out from under his nails with his dirk wheres your love of music bronn if it was music you wanted you should have gotten the singer to champion you tyrion grinned that would have been amusing i can just see him fending off ser vardis with his woodharp he resumed his whistling do you know this song he asked you hear it here and there in inns and whorehouses myrish the seasons of my love sweet and sad if you understand the words the first girl i ever bedded used to sing it and ive never been able to put it out of my head tyrion gazed up at the sky it was a clear cold night and the stars shone down upon the mountains as bright and merciless as truth i met her on a night like this he heard himself saying jaime and i were riding back from lannisport when we heard a scream and she came running out into the road with two men dogging her heels shouting page threats my brother unsheathed his sword and went after them while i dismounted to protect the girl she was scarcely a year older than i was darkhaired slender with a face that would break your heart it certainly broke mine lowborn halfstarved unwashed yet lovely theyd torn the rags she was wearing half off her back so i wrapped her in my cloak while jaime chased the men into the woods by the time he came trotting back id gotten a name out of her and a story she was a crofters child orphaned when her father died of fever on her way to well nowhere really jaime was all in a lather to hunt down the men it was not often outlaws dared prey on travelers so near to casterly rock and he took it as an insult the girl was too frightened to send off by herself though so i offered to take her to the closest inn and feed her while my brother rode back to the rock for help she was hungrier than i would have believed we finished two whole chickens and part of a third and drank a flagon of wine talking i was only thirteen and the wine went to my head i fear the next thing i knew i was sharing her bed if she was shy i was shyer ill never know where i found the courage when i broke her maidenhead she wept but afterward she kissed me and sang her little song and by morning i was in love you bronns voice was amused absurd isnt it tyrion began to whistle the song again i married her he finally admitted a lannister of casterly rock wed to a crofters daughter bronn said how did you manage that oh youd be astonished at what a boy can make of a few lies fifty pieces of silver and a drunken septon i dared not bring my bride home to casterly rock so i set her up in a cottage of her own and for a fortnight we played at being man and wife and then the septon sobered and confessed all to my lord father tyrion was surprised at how desolate it made him feel to say it even after all these years perhaps he was just tired that was the end of my marriage he sat up and stared at the dying fire blinking at the light he sent the girl away he did better than that tyrion said first he made my brother tell me the truth the girl was a whore you see jaime arranged the whole affair the road the outlaws all of it he thought it was time i had a woman he paid double for a maiden knowing it would be my first time after jaime had made his confession to drive home the lesson lord tywin brought my wife in and gave her to his guards they paid her fair enough a silver for each man how many whores command that high a price he sat me down in the corner of the barracks and bade me watch and at the end she had so many silvers the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling on the floor she the smoke was stinging his eyes tyrion cleared his throat and turned away from the fire to gaze out into darkness lord tywin had me go last he said in a quiet voice and he gave me a gold coin to pay her because i was a lannister and worth more page after a time he heard the noise again the rasp of steel on stone as bronn sharpened his sword thirteen or thirty or three i would have killed the man who did that to me tyrion swung around to face him you may get that chance one day remember what i told you a lannister always pays his debts he yawned i think i will try and sleep wake me if were about to die he rolled himself up in the shadowskin and shut his eyes the ground was stony and cold but after a time tyrion lannister did sleep he dreamt of the sky cell this time he was the gaoler not the prisoner big with a strap in his hand and he was hitting his father driving him back toward the abyss tyrion bronns warning was low and urgent tyrion was awake in the blink of an eye the fire had burned down to embers and the shadows were creeping in all around them bronn had raised himself to one knee his sword in one hand and his dirk in the other tyrion held up a hand stay still it said come share our fire the night is cold he called out to the creeping shadows i fear weve no wine to offer you but youre welcome to some of our goat all movement stopped tyrion saw the glint of moonlight on metal our mountain a voice called out from the trees deep and hard and unfriendly our goat your goat tyrion agreed who are you when you meet your gods a different voice replied say it was gunthor son of gurn of the stone crows who sent you to them a branch cracked underfoot as he stepped into the light a thin man in a horned helmet armed with a long knife and shagga son of dolf that was the first voice deep and deadly a boulder shifted to their left and stood and became a man massive and slow and strong he seemed dressed all in skins with a club in his right hand and an axe in his left he smashed them together as he lumbered closer other voices called other names conn and torrek and jaggot and more that tyrion forgot the instant he heard them ten at least a few had swords and knives others brandished pitchforks and scythes and wooden spears he waited until they were done shouting out their names before he gave them answer i am tyrion son of tywin of the clan lannister the lions of the rock we will gladly pay you for the goat we ate what do you have to give us tyrion son of tywin asked the one who named himself gunthor who seemed to be their chief there is silver in my purse tyrion told them this hauberk i wear is large for me but it should fit conn nicely and the battleaxe i carry would suit shaggas mighty hand far better than that woodaxe he holds the halfman would pay us with our own coin said conn conn speaks truly gunthor said your silver is ours your horses are ours your hauberk and your battleaxe and the knife at your belt those are ours too you have nothing to give us but your lives how page would you like to die tyrion son of tywin in my own bed with a belly full of wine and a maidens mouth around my cock at the age of eighty he replied the huge one shagga laughed first and loudest the others seemed less amused conn take their horses gunthor commanded kill the other and seize the halfinan he can milk the goats and make the mothers laugh bronn sprang to his feet who dies first no tyrion said sharply gunthor son of gurn hear me my house is rich and powerful if the stone crows will see us safely through these mountains my lord father will shower you with gold the gold of a lowland lord is as worthless as a halfmans promises gunthor said half a man i may be tyrion said yet i have the courage to face my enemies what do the stone crows do but hide behind rocks and shiver with fear as the knights of the vale ride by shagga gave a roar of anger and clashed club against axe jaggot poked at tyrions face with the firehardened point of a long wooden spear he did his best not to flinch are these the best weapons you could steal he said good enough for killing sheep perhaps if the sheep do not fight back my fathers smiths shit better steel little boyman shagga roared will you mock my axe after i chop off your manhood and feed it to the goats but gunthor raised a hand no i would hear his words the mothers go hungry and steel fills more mouths than gold what would you give us for your lives tyrion son of tywin swords lances mail all that and more gunthor son of gurn tyrion lannister replied smiling i will give you the vale of arryn eddard through the high narrow windows of the red keeps cavernous throne room the light of sunset spilled across the floor laying dark red stripes upon the walls where the heads of dragons had once hung now the stone was covered with hunting tapestries vivid with greens and browns and blues and yet still it seemed to ned stark that the only color in the hall was the red of blood he sat high upon the immense ancient seat of aegon the conqueror an ironwork monstrosity of spikes and jagged edges and grotesquely twisted metal it was as robert had warned him a hellishly uncomfortable chair and never more so than now with his shattered leg throbbing more sharply every minute the metal beneath him had grown harder by the hour and the fanged steel behind made it impossible to lean back a king should never sit easy aegon the conqueror had said when he commanded his armorers to forge a great seat from the swords laid down by his enemies damn aegon for his arrogance ned thought sullenly and damn robert and his hunting as well you are quite certain these were more than brigands varys asked softly from the council table page beneath the throne grand maester pycelle stirred uneasily beside him while littlefinger toyed with a pen they were the only councillors in attendance a white hart had been sighted in the kingswood and lord renly and ser barristan had joined the king to hunt it along with prince joffrey sandor clegane balon swann and half the court so ned must needs sit the iron throne in his absence at least he could sit save the council the rest must stand respectfully or kneel the petitioners clustered near the tall doors the knights and high lords and ladies beneath the tapestries the smallfolk in the gallery the mailed guards in their cloaks gold or grey all stood the villagers were kneeling men women and children alike tattered and bloody their faces drawn by fear the three knights who had brought them here to bear witness stood behind them brigands lord varys ser raymun darrys voice dripped scorn oh they were brigands beyond a doubt lannister brigands ned could feel the unease in the hall as high lords and servants alike strained to listen he could not pretend to surprise the west had been a tinderbox since catelyn had seized tyrion lannister both riverrun and casterly rock had called their banners and armies were massing in the pass below the golden tooth it had only been a matter of time until the blood began to flow the sole question that remained was how best to stanch the wound sadeyed ser karyl vance who would have been handsome but for the winestain birthmark that discolored his face gestured at the kneeling villagers this is all the remains of the holdfast of sherrer lord eddard the rest are dead along with the people of wendish town and the mummers ford rise ned commanded the villagers he never trusted what a man told him from his knees all of you up in ones and twos the holdfast of sherrer struggled to its feet one ancient needed to be helped and a young girl in a bloody dress stayed on her knees staring blankly at ser arys oakheart who stood by the foot of the throne in the white armor of the kingsguard ready to protect and defend the king or ned supposed the kings hand joss ser raymun darry said to a plump balding man in a brewers apron tell the hand what happened at sherrer joss nodded if it please his grace his grace is hunting across the blackwater ned said wondering how a man could live his whole life a few days ride from the red keep and still have no notion what his king looked like ned was clad in a white linen doublet with the direwolf of stark on the breast his black wool cloak was fastened at the collar by his silver hand of office black and white and grey all the shades of truth i am lord eddard stark the kings hand tell me who you are and what you know of these raiders i keep i kept i kept an alehouse mlord in sherrer by page the stone bridge the finest ale south of the neck everyone said so begging your pardons mord its gone now like all the rest mlord they come and drank their fill and spilled the rest before they fired my roof and they would of spilled my blood too if theyd caught me mlord they burnt us out a farmer beside him said come riding in the dark up from the south and fired the fields and the houses alike killing them as tried to stop them they werent no raiders though mord they had no mind to steal our stock not these they butchered my milk cow where she stood and left her for the flies and the crows they rode down my prentice boy said a squat man with a smiths muscles and a bandage around his head he had put on his finest clothes to come to court but his breeches were patched his cloak travelstained and dusty chased him back and forth across the fields on their horses poking at him with their lances like it was a game them laughing and the boy stumbling and screaming till the big one pierced him clean through the girl on her knees craned her head up at ned high above her on the throne they killed my mother too your grace and they they her voice trailed off as if she had forgotten what she was about to say she began to sob ser raymun darry took up the tale at wendish town the people sought shelter in their holdfast but the walls were timbered the raiders piled straw against the wood and burnt them all alive when the wendish folk opened their gates to flee the fire they shot them down with arrows as they came running out even women with suckling babes oh dreadful murmured varys how cruel can men be they would of done the same for us but the sherrer holdfasts made of stone joss said some wanted to smoke us out but the big one said there was riper fruit upriver and they made for the mummers ford ned could feel cold steel against his fingers as he leaned forward between each finger was a blade the points of twisted swords fanning out like talons from arms of the throne even after three centuries some were still sharp enough to cut the iron throne was full of traps for the unwary the songs said it had taken a thousand blades to make it heated whitehot in the furnace breath of balerion the black dread the hammering had taken fiftynine days the end of it was this hunched black beast made of razor edges and barbs and ribbons of sharp metal a chair that could kill a man and had if the stories could be believed what eddard stark was doing sitting there he would never comprehend yet there he sat and these people looked to him for justice what proof do you have that these were lannisters he asked trying to keep his fury under control did they wear crimson cloaks or fly a lion banner even lannisters are not so blind stupid as that ser marq piper snapped he was a swaggering bantam rooster of a youth too young and too hotblooded for neds taste though a fast friend of catelyns brother edmure tully every man among them was mounted and mailed my lord ser karyl answered calmly they were armed with steeltipped lances and longswords with battleaxes for the butchering he gestured toward one of the ragged survivors you yes you no ones going to hurt you tell the hand what you told page me the old man bobbed his head concerning their horses he said it were warhorses they rode many a year i worked in old ser willums stables so i knows the difference not a one of these ever pulled a plow gods bear witness if im wrong wellmounted brigands observed littlefinger perhaps they stole the horses from the last place they raided how many men were there in this raiding party ned asked a hundred at the least joss answered in the same instant as the bandaged smith said fifty and the grandmother behind him hunnerds and hunnerds mord an army they was you are more right than you know goodwoman lord eddard told her you say they flew no banners what of the armor they wore did any of you note ornaments or decorations devices on shield or helm the brewer joss shook his head it grieves me mord but no the armor they showed us was plain only the one who led them he was armored like the rest but there was no mistaking him all the same it was the size of him mlord those as say the giants are all dead never saw this one i swear big as an ox he was and a voice like stone breaking the mountain ser marq said loudly can any man doubt it this was gregor cleganes work ned heard muttering from beneath the windows and the far end of the hall even in the galley nervous whispers were exchanged high lords and smallfolk alike knew what it could mean if ser marq was proved right ser gregor clegane stood bannerman to lord tywin lannister he studied the frightened faces of the villagers small wonder they had been so fearful they had thought they were being dragged here to name lord tywin a redhanded butcher before a king who was his son by marriage he wondered if the knights had given them a choice grand maester pycelle rose ponderously from the council table his chain of office clinking ser marq with respect you cannot know that this outlaw was ser gregor there are many large men in the realm as large as the mountain that rides ser karyl said i have never met one nor has any man here ser raymun added hotly even his brother is a pup beside him my lords open your eyes do you need to see his seal on the corpses it was gregor why should ser gregor turn brigand pycelle asked by the grace of his liege lord he holds a stout keep and lands of his own the man is an anointed knight a false knight ser marq said lord tywins mad dog my lord hand pycelle declared in a stiff voice i urge you to remind this good knight that lord tywin lannister is the father of our own gracious queen page thank you grand maester pycelle ned said i fear we might have forgotten that if you had not pointed it out from his vantage point atop the throne he could see men slipping out the door at the far end of the hall hares going to ground he supposed or rats off to nibble the queens cheese he caught a glimpse of septa mordane in the gallery with his daughter sansa beside her ned felt a flash of anger this was no place for a girl but the septa could not have known that todays court would be anything but the usual tedious business of hearing petitions settling disputes between rival holdfasts and adjudicating the placement of boundary stones at the council table below petyr baelish lost interest in his quill and leaned forward ser marq ser karyl ser raymunperhaps i might ask you a question these holdfasts were under your protection where were you when all this slaughtering and burning was going on ser karyl vance answered i was attending my lord father in the pass below the golden tooth as was ser marq when the word of these outrages reached ser edmure tully he sent word that we should take a small force of men to find what survivors we could and bring them to the king ser raymun darry spoke up ser edmure had summoned me to riverrun with all my strength i was camped across the river from his walls awaiting his commands when the word reached me by the time could return to my own lands clegane and his vermin were back across the red fork riding for lannisters hills littlefinger stroked the point of his beard thoughtfully and if they come again ser if they come again well use their blood to water the fields they burnt ser marq piper declared hotly ser edmure has sent men to every village and holdfast within a days ride of the border ser karyl explained the next raider will not have such an easy time of it and that may be precisely what lord tywin wants ned thought to himself to bleed off strength from riverrun goad the boy into scattering his swords his wifes brother was young and more gallant than wise he would try to hold every inch of his soil to defend every man woman and child who named him lord and tywin lannister was shrewd enough to know that if your fields and holdfasts are safe from harm lord petyr was saying what then do you ask of the throne the lords of the trident keep the kings peace ser raymun darry said the lannisters have broken it we ask leave to answer them steel for steel we ask justice for the smallfolk of sherrer and wendish town and the mummers ford edmure agrees we must pay gregor clegane back his bloody coin ser marq declared but old lord hoster commanded us to come here and beg the kings leave before we strike thank the gods for old lord hoster then tywin lannister was as much fox as lion if indeed hed sent ser gregor to burn and pillageand ned did not doubt that he hadhed taken care to see that he rode page under cover of night without banners in the guise of a common brigand should riverrun strike back cersei and her father would insist that it had been the tullys who broke the kings peace not the lannisters the gods only knew what robert would believe grand maester pycelle was on his feet again my lord hand if these good folk believe that ser gregor has forsaken his holy vows for plunder and rape let them go to his liege lord and make their complaint these crimes are no concern of the throne let them seek lord tywins justice it is all the kings justice ned told him north south east or west all we do we do in roberts name the kings justice grand maester pycelle said so it is and so we should defer this matter until the king the king is hunting across the river and may not return for days lord eddard said robert bid me to sit here in his place to listen with his ears and to speak with his voice i mean to do just that though i agree that he must be told he saw a familiar face beneath the tapestries ser robar ser robar royce stepped forward and bowed my lord your father is hunting with the king ned said will you bring them word of what was said and done here today at once my lord do we have your leave to take our vengeance against ser gregor then marq piper asked the throne vengeance ned said i thought we were speaking of justice burning cleganes fields and slaughtering his people will not restore the kings peace only your injured pride he glanced away before the young knight could voice his outraged protest and addressed the villagers people of sherrer i cannot give you back your homes or your crops nor can i restore your dead to life but perhaps i can give you some small measure of justice in the name of our king robert every eye in the hall was fixed on him waiting slowly ned struggled to his feet pushing himself up from the throne with the strength of his arms his shattered leg screaming inside its cast he did his best to ignore the pain it was no moment to let them see his weakness the first men believed that the judge who called for death should wield the sword and in the north we hold to that still i mislike sending another to do my killing yet it seems i have no choice he gestured at his broken leg lord eddard the shout came from the west side of the hall as a handsome stripling of a boy strode forth boldly out of his armor ser loras tyrell looked even younger than his sixteen years he wore pale blue silk his belt a linked chain of golden roses the sigil of his house i beg you the honor of acting in your place give this task to me my lord and i swear i shall not fail you littlefinger chuckled ser loras if we send you off alone ser gregor will send us back your head with a plum stuffed in that pretty mouth of yours the mountain is not the sort to bend his neck to any mans justice page i do not fear gregor clegane ser loras said haughtily ned eased himself slowly back onto the hard iron seat of aegons misshapen throne his eyes searched the faces along the wall lord beric he called out thoros of myr ser gladden lord lothar the men named stepped forward one by one each of you is to assemble twenty men to bring my word to gregors keep twenty of my own guards shall go with you lord beric dondarrion you shall have the command as befits your rank the young lord with the redgold hair bowed as you command lord eddard ned raised his voice so it carried to the far end of the throne room in the name of robert of the house baratheon the first of his name king of the andals and the rhoynar and the first men lord of the seven kingdoms and protector of the realm by the word of eddard of the house stark his hand i charge you to ride to the westlands with all haste to cross the red fork of the trident under the kings flag and there bring the kings justice to the false knight gregor clegane and to all those who shared in his crimes i denounce him and attaint him and strip him of all rank and titles of all lands and incomes and holdings and do sentence him to death may the gods take pity on his soul when the echo of his words had died away the knight of flowers seemed perplexed lord eddard what of me ned looked down on him from on high loras tyrell seemed almost as young as robb no one doubts your valor ser loras but we are about justice here and what you seek is vengeance he looked back to lord beric ride at first light these things are best done quickly he held up a hand the throne will hear no more petitions today alyn and porther climbed the steep iron steps to help him back down as they made their descent he could feel loras tyrells sullen stare but the boy had stalked away before ned reached the floor of the throne room at the base of the iron throne varys was gathering papers from the council table littlefinger and grand maester pycelle had already taken their leave you are a bolder man than my lord the eunuch said softly how so lord varys ned asked brusquely his leg was throbbing and he was in no mood for word games had it been me up there i should have sent ser loras he so wanted to go and a man who has the lannisters for his enemies would do well to make the tyrells his friends ser loras is young said ned i daresay he will outgrow the disappointment and ser ilyn the eunuch stroked a plump powdered cheek he is the kings justice after all sending other men to do his office some might construe that as a grave insult no slight was intended in truth ned did not trust the mute knight though perhaps that was only because he misliked execution page ers i remind you the paynes are bannermen to house lannister i thought it best to choose men who owed lord tywin no fealty very prudent no doubt varys said still i chanced to see ser ilyn in the back of the hall staring at us with those pale eyes of his and i must say he did not look pleased though to be sure it is hard to tell with our silent knight i hope he outgrows his disappointment as well he does so love his work sansa he wouldnt send ser loras sansa told jeyne poole that night as they shared a cold supper by lamplight i think it was because of his leg lord eddard had taken his supper in his bedchamber with alyn harwin and vayon poole the better to rest his broken leg and septa mordane had complained of sore feet after standing in the gallery all day arya was supposed to join them but she was late coming back from her dancing lesson his leg jeyne said uncertainly she was a pretty darkhaired girl of sansas own age did ser loras hurt his leg not his leg sansa said nibbling delicately at a chicken leg fathers leg silly it hurts him ever so much it makes him cross otherwise im certain he would have sent ser loras her fathers decision still bewildered her when the knight of flowers had spoken up shed been sure she was about to see one of old nans stories come to life ser gregor was the monster and ser loras the true hero who would slay him he even looked a true hero so slim and beautiful with golden roses around his slender waist and his rich brown hair tumbling down into his eyes and then father had refused him it had upset her more than she could tell she had said as much to septa mordane as they descended the stairs from the gallery but the septa had only told her it was not her place to question her lord fathers decisions that was when lord baelish had said oh i dont know septa some of her lord fathers decisions could do with a bit of questioning the young lady is as wise as she is lovely he made a sweeping bow to sansa so deep she was not quite sure if she was being complimented or mocked septa mordane had been very upset to realize that lord baelish had overheard them the girl was just talking my lord shed said foolish chatter she meant nothing by the comment lord baelish stroked his little pointed beard and said nothing tell me child why would you have sent ser loras page sansa had no choice but to explain about heroes and monsters the kings councillor smiled well those are not the reasons id have given but he had touched her cheek his thumb lightly tracing the line of a cheekbone life is not a song sweetling you may learn that one day to your sorrow sansa did not feel like telling all that to jeyne however it made her uneasy just to think back on it ser ilyns the kings justice not ser loras jcyne said lord eddard should have sent him sansa shuddered every time she looked at ser ilyn payne she shivered he made her feel as though something dead were slithering over her naked skin ser ilyns almost like a second monster im glad father didnt pick him lord beric is as much a hero as ser loras hes ever so brave and gallant i suppose sansa said doubtfully beric dondarrion was handsome enough but he was awfully old almost twentytwo the knight of flowers would have been much better of course jeyne had been in love with lord beric ever since she had first glimpsed him in the lists sansa thought she was being silly jeyne was only a stewards daughter after all and no matter how much she mooned after him lord beric would never look at someone so far beneath him even if she hadnt been half his age it would have been unkind to say so however so sansa took a sip of milk and changed the subject i had a dream that jofftey would be the one to take the white hart she said it had been more of a wish actually but it sounded better to call it a dream everyone knew that dreams were prophetic white harts were supposed to be very rare and magical and in her heart she knew her gallant prince was worthier than his drunken father a dream truly did prince joffrey just go up to it and touch it with his bare hand and do it no harm no sansa said he shot it with a golden arrow and brought it back for me in the songs the knights never killed magical beasts they just went up to them and touched them and did them no harm but she knew jofftey liked hunting especially the killing part only animals though sansa was certain her prince had no part in murdering jory and those other poor men that had been his wicked uncle the kingslayer she knew her father was still angry about that but it wasnt fair to blame joff that would be like blaming her for something that arya had done i saw your sister this afternoon jeyne blurted out as if shed been reading sansas thoughts she was walking through the stables on her hands why would she do a thing like that im sure i dont know why arya does anything sansa hated stables smelly places full of manure and flies even when she went riding she liked the boy to saddle the horse and bring it to her in the yard do you want to hear about the court or not i do jeyne said therewas a black brother sansa said begging men for the wall only he was kind of old and smelly she hadnt liked that at all she had always imagined the nights watch to be men like uncle benjen in the songs they were called the black knights of the wall but this man had been crookbacked and hideous and he looked as though he might have lice if this was what the nights watch was truly like she felt sorry for her bastard half brother jon father asked if there were any knights in the hall page who would do honor to their houses by taking the black but no one came forward so he gave this yoren his pick of the kings dungeons and sent him on his way and later these two brothers came before him freeriders from the dornish marches and pledged their swords to the service of the king father accepted their oaths jeyne yawned are there any lemon cakes sansa did not like being interrupted but she had to admit lemon cakes sounded more interesting than most of what had gone on in the throne room lets see she said the kitchen yielded no lemon cakes but they did find half of a cold strawberry pie and that was almost as good they ate it on the tower steps giggling and gossiping and sharing secrets and sansa went to bed that night feeling almost as wicked as arya the next morning she woke before first light and crept sleepily to her window to watch lord beric form up his men they rode out as dawn was breaking over the city with three banners going before them the crowned stag of the king flew from the high staff the direwolf of stark and lord berics own forked lightning standard from shorter poles it was all so exciting a song come to life the clatter of swords the flicker of torchlight banners dancing in the wind horses snorting and whinnying the golden glow of sunrise slanting through the bars of the portcullis as it jerked upward the winterfell men looked especially fine in their silvery mail and long grey cloaks alyn carried the stark banner when she saw him rein in beside lord beric to exchange words it made sansa feel ever so proud alyn was handsomer than jory had been he was going to be a knight one day the tower of the hand seemed so empty after they left that sansa was even pleased to see arya when she went down to break her fast where is everyone her sister wanted to know as she ripped the skin from a blood orange did father send them to hunt down jaime lannister sansa sighed they rode with lord beric to behead ser gregor clegane she turned to septa mordane who was eating porridge with a wooden spoon septa will lord beric spike ser gregors head on his own gate or bring it back here for the king she and jeyne poole had been arguing over that last night the septa was horrorstruck a lady does not discuss such things over her porridge where are your courtesies sansa i swear of late youve been near as bad as your sister what did gregor do arya asked he burned down a holdfast and murdered a lot of people women and children too arya screwed up her face in a scowl jaime lannister murdered jory and heward and wyl and the hound murdered mycah somebody should have beheaded them its not the same sansa said the hound is joffreys sworn shield your butchers boy attacked the prince page liar arya said her hand clenched the blood orange so hard that red juice oozed between her fingers go ahead call me all the names you want sansa said airily you wont dare when im married to joffrey youll have to bow to me and call me your grace she shrieked as arya flung the orange across the table it caught her in the middle of the forehead with a wet squish and plopped down into her lap you have juice on your face your grace arya said it was running down her nose and stinging her eyes sansa wiped it away with a napkin when she saw what the fruit in her lap had done to her beautiful ivory silk dress she shrieked again youre horrible she screamed at her sister they should have killed you instead of lady septa mordane came lurching to her feet your lord father will hear of this go to your chambers at once at once me too tears welled in sansas eyes thats not fair the matter is not subject to discussion go sansa stalked away with her head up she was to be a queen and queens did not cry at least not where people could see when she reached her bedchamber she barred the door and took off her dress the blood orange had left a blotchy red stain on the silk i hate her she screamed she balled up the dress and flung it into the cold hearth on top of the ashes of last nights fire when she saw that the stain had bled through onto her underskirt she began to sob despite herself she ripped off the rest of her clothes wildly threw herself into bed and cried herself back to sleep it was midday when septa mordane knocked upon her door sansa your lord father will see you now sansa sat up lady she whispered for a moment it was as if the direwolf was there in the room looking at her with those golden eyes sad and knowing she had been dreaming she realized lady was with her and they were running together and and trying to remember was like trying to catch the rain with her fingers the dream faded and lady was dead again sansa the rap came again sharply do you hear me yes septa she called out might i have a moment to dress please her eyes were red from crying but she did her best to make herself beautiful lord eddard was bent over a huge leatherbound book when septa mordane marched her into the solar his plasterwrapped leg stiff beneath the table come here sansa he said not unkindly when the septa had gone for her sister sit beside me he closed the book septa mordane returned with arya squirming in her grasp sansa had put on a lovely pale green damask gown and a look of remorse but her sister was still wearing the ratty leathers and roughspun shed worn at breakfast here is the other one the septa announced page my thanks septa mordane i would talk to my daughters alone if you would be so kind the septa bowed and left arya started it sansa said quickly anxious to have the first word she called me a liar and threw an orange at me and spoiled my dress the ivory silk the one queen cersei gave me when i was betrothed to prince joffrey she hates that im going to marry the prince she tries to spoil everything father she cant stand for anything to be beautiful or nice or splendid enough sansa lord eddards voice was sharp with impatience arya raised her eyes im sorry father i was wrong and i beg my sweet sisters forgiveness sansa was so startled that for a moment she was speechless finally she found her voice what about my dress maybe i could wash it arya said doubtfully washing wont do any good sansa said not if you scrubbed all day and all night the silk is ruined then ill make you a new one arya said sansa threw back her head in disdain you you couldnt sew a dress fit to clean the pigsties their father sighed i did not call you here to talk of dresses im sending you both back to winterfell for the second time sansa found herself too stunned for words she felt her eyes grow moist again you cant arya said please father sansa managed at last please dont eddard stark favored his daughters with a tired smile at last weve found something you agree on i didnt do anything wrong sansa pleaded with him i dont want to go back she loved mngs landing the pagaentry of the court the high lords and ladies in their velvets and silks and gemstones the great city with all its people the tournament had been the most magical time of her whole life and there was so much she had not seen yet harvest feasts and masked balls and mummer shows she could not bear the thought of losing it all send arya away she started it father i swear it ill be good youll see just let me stay and i promise to be as fine and noble and courteous as the queen fathers mouth twitched strangely sansa im not sending you away for fighting though the gods know im sick of you two squabbling i want you back in winterfell for your own safety three of my men were cut down like dogs not a league from where we sit and what does robert do he goes hunting arya was chewing at her lip in that disgusting way she had can we take syrio back with us page who cares about your stupid dancing master sansa flared father i only just now remembered i cant go away im to marry prince joffrey she tried to smile bravely for him i love him father i truly truly do i love him as much as queen naerys loved prince aemon the dragonknight as much as jonquil loved ser florian i want to be his queen and have his babies sweet one her father said gently listen to me when youre old enough i will make you a match with a high lord whos worthy of you someone brave and gentle and strong this match with joffrey was a terrible mistake that boy is no prince aemon you must believe me he is sansa insisted i dont want someone brave and gentle i want him well be ever so happy just like in the songs youll see ill give him a son with golden hair and one day hell be the king of all the realm the greatest king that ever was as brave as the wolf and as proud as the lion arya made a face not if joffreys his father she said hes a liar and a craven and anyhow hes a stag not a lion sansa felt tears in her eyes he is not hes not the least bit like that old drunken king she screamed at her sister forgetting herself in her grief father looked at her strangely gods he swore softly out of the mouth of babes he shouted for septa mordane to the girls he said i am looking for a fast trading galley to take you home these days the sea is safer than the kingsroad you will sail as soon as i can find a proper ship with septa mordane and a complement of guards and yes with syrio forel if he agrees to enter my service but say nothing of this its better if no one knows of our plans well talk again tomorrow sansa cried as septa mordane marched them down the steps they were going to take it all away the tournaments and the court and her prince everything they were going to send her back to the bleak grey walls of winterfell and lock her up forever her life was over before it had begun stop that weeping child septa mordane said sternly i am certain your lord father knows what is best for you it wont be so bad sansa arya said were going to sail on a galley it will be an adventure and then well be with bran and robb again and old nan and hodor and the rest she touched her on the arm hodor sansa yelled you ought to marry hodor youre just like him stupid and hairy and ugly she wrenched away from her sisters hand stormed into her bedchamber and barred the door behind her eddard pain is a gift from the gods lord eddard grand maester pycelle told him it means the bone is knitting the flesh healing itself be thankful i will be thankful when my leg stops throbbing page pycelle set a stoppered flask on the table by the bed the milk of the poppy for when the pain grows too onerous i sleep too much already sleep is the great healer i had hoped that was you pycelle smiled wanly it is good to see you in such a fierce humor my lord he leaned close and lowered his voice there was a raven this morning a letter for the queen from her lord father i thought you had best know dark wings dark words ned said grimly what of it lord tywin is greatly wroth about the men you sent after ser gregor clegane the maester confided i feared he would be you will recall i said as much in council let him be wroth ned said every time his leg throbbed he remembered jaime lannisters smile and jory dead in his arms let him write all the letters to the queen he likes lord beric rides beneath the kings own banner if lord tywin attempts to interfere with the kings justice he will have robert to answer to the only thing his grace enjoys more than hunting is making war on lords who defy him pycelle pulled back his maesters chain jangling as you say i shall visit again on the morrow the old man hurriedly gathered up his things and took his leave ned had little doubt that he was bound straight for the royal apartments to whisper at the queen i thought you had best know indeed as if cersei had not instructed him to pass along her fathers threats he hoped his response rattled those perfect teeth of hers ned was not near as confident of robert as he pretended but there was no reason cersei need know that when pycelle was gone ned called for a cup of honeyed wine that clouded the mind as well yet not as badly he needed to be able to think a thousand times he asked himself what jon arryn might have done had he lived long enough to act on what hed learned or perhaps he had acted and died for it it was queer how sometimes a childs innocent eyes can see things that grown men are blind to someday when sansa was grown he would have to tell her how she had made it all come clear for him hes not the least bit like that old drunken king she had declared angry and unknowing and the simple truth of it had twisted inside him cold as death this was the sword that killed jon anyn ned thought then and it will kill robert as well a slower death but full as certain shattered legs may heal in time but some betrayals fester and poison the soul littlefinger came calling an hour after the grand maester had left clad in a plumcolored doublet with a mockingbird embroidered on the breast in black thread and a striped cloak of black and white i cannot visit long my lord he announced lady tanda expects me to lunch with her no doubt she will roast me a fatted calf if its near as fatted as her daughter im like to rupture and die and how is your leg page inflamed and painful with an itch that is driving me mad littlefinger lifted an eyebrow in future try not to let any horses fall on it i would urge you to heal quickly the realm grows restive varys has heard ominous whispers from the west freeriders and sellswords have been flocking to casterly rock and not for the thin pleasure of lord tywins conversation is there word of the king ned demanded just how long does robert intend to hunt given his preferences i believe hed stay in the forest until you and the queen both die of old age lord petyr replied with a faint smile lacking that i imagine hell return as soon as hes killed something they found the white hart it seems or rather what remained of it some wolves found it first and left his grace scarcely more than a hoof and a horn robert was in a fury until he heard talk of some monstrous boar deeper in the forest then nothing would do but he must have it prince joffrey returned this morning with the royces ser balon swann and some twenty others of the party the rest are still with the king the hound ned asked frowning of all the lannister party sandor clegane was the one who concerned him the most now that ser jaime had fled the city to join his father oh returned with joffrey and went straight to the queen littlefinger smiled i would have given a hundred silver stags to have been a roach in the rushes when he learned that lord beric was off to behead his brother even a blind man could see the hound loathed his brother ah but gregor was his to loathe not yours to kill once dondarrion lops the summit off our mountain the clegane lands and incomes will pass to sandor but i wouldnt hold my water waiting for his thanks not that one and now you must forgive me lady tanda awaits with her fatted calves on the way to the door lord petyr spied grand maester malleons massive tome on the table and paused to idly flip open the cover the lineages and histories of the great houses of the seven kingdoms with descriptions of many high lords and noble ladies and their children he read now there is tedious reading if ever i saw it a sleeping potion my lord for a brief moment ned considered telling him all of it but there was something in littlefingers japes that irked him the man was too clever by half a mocking smile never far from his lips jon arryn was studying this volume when he was taken sick ned said in a careful tone to see how he might respond and he responded as he always did with a quip in that case he said death must have come as a blessed relief lord petyr baelish bowed and took his leave eddard stark allowed himself a curse aside from his own retainers there was scarcely a man in this city he trusted littlefinger had concealed catelyn and helped ned in his inquiries yet his haste to save his own skin when jaime and his swords had come out of the rain still rankled varys was worse for all his protestations of loyalty the eunuch knew too much and did too little grand maester pycelle seemed more cerseis creature with every passing day and ser barristan was an old man and rigid he would tell ned to do his duty page time was perilously short the king would return from his hunt soon and honor would require ned to go to him with all he had learned vayon poole had arranged for sansa and arya to sail on the wind witch out of braavos three days hence they would be back at winterfell before the harvest ned could no longer use his concern for their safety to excuse his delay yet last night he had dreamt of rhaegars children lord tywin had laid the bodies beneath the iron throne wrapped in the crimson cloaks of his house guard that was clever of him the blood did not show so badly against the red cloth the little princess had been barefoot still dressed in her bed gown and the boy the boy ned could not let that happen again the realm could not withstand a second mad king another dance of blood and vengeance he must find some way to save the children robert could be merciful ser barristan was scarcely the only man he had pardoned grand maester pycelle varys the spider lord balon greyjoy each had been counted an enemy to robert once and each had been welcomed into friendship and allowed to retain honors and office for a pledge of fealty so long as a man was brave and honest robert would treat him with all the honor and respect due a valiant enemy this was something else poison in the dark a knife thrust to the soul this he could never forgive no more than he had forgiven rhaegar he will kill them all ned realized and yet he knew he could not keep silent he had a duty to robert to the realm to the shade of jon arryn and to bran who surely must have stumbled on some part of the truth why else would they have tried to slay him late that afternoon he summoned tomard the portly guardsman with the gingercolored whiskers his children called fat tom with jory dead and alyn gone fat tom had command of his household guard the thought filled ned with vague disquiet tomard was a solid man affable loyal tireless capable in a limited way but he was near fifty and even in his youth he had never been energetic perhaps ned should not have been so quick to send off half his guard and all his best swords among them i shall require your help ned said when tomard appeared looking faintly apprehensive as he always did when called before his lord take me to the godswood is that wise lord eddard with your leg and all perhaps not but necessary tomard summoned varly with one arm around each mans shoulders ned managed to descend the steep tower steps and hobble across the bailey i want the guard doubled he told fat tom no one enters or leaves the tower of the hand without my leave page tom blinked nilord with alyn and the others away we are hardpressed already it will only be a short while lengthen the watches as you say mlord tom answered might i ask why best not ned answered crisply the godswood was empty as it always was here in this citadel of the southron gods neds leg was screaming as they lowered him to the grass beside the heart tree thank you he drew a paper from his sleeve sealed with the sigil of his house kindly deliver this at once tomard looked at the name ned had written on the paper and licked his lips anxiously my lord do as i bid you tom ned said how long he waited in the quiet of the godswood he could not say it was peaceful here the thick walls shut out the clamor of the castle and he could hear birds singing the murmur of crickets leaves rustling in a gentle wind the heart tree was an oak brown and faceless yet ned stark still felt the presence of his gods his leg did not seem to hurt so much she came to him at sunset as the clouds reddened above the walls and towers she came alone as he had bid her for once she was dressed simply in leather boots and hunting greens when she drew back the hood of her brown cloak he saw the bruise where the king had struck her the angry plum color had faded to yellow and the swelling was down but there was no mistaking it for anything but what it was why here cersei lannister asked as she stood over him so the gods can see she sat beside him on the grass her every move was graceful her curling blond hair moved in the wind and her eyes were green as the leaves of summer it had been a long time since ned stark had seen her beauty but he saw it now i know the truth jon arryn died for he told her do you the queen watched his face wary as a cat is that why you called me here lord stark to pose me riddles or is it your intent to seize me as your wife seized my brother if you truly believed that you would never have come ned touched her cheek gently has he done this before once or twice she shied away from his hand never on the face before jaime would have killed him even if it meant his own life cersei looked at him defiantly my brother is worth a hundred of your friend your brother ned said or your lover both she did not flinch from the truth since we were children together and why not the targaryens wed brother to sister for three hundred years to keep the bloodlines pure and jaime and i page are more than brother and sister we are one person in two bodies we shared a womb together he came into this world holding my foot our old maester said when he is in me i feel whole the ghost of a smile flitted over her lips my son bran to her credit cersei did not look away he saw us you love your children do you not robert had asked him the very same question the morning of the melee he gave her the same answer with all my heart no less do i love mine ned thought if it came to that the life of some child i did not know against robb and sansa and arya and bran and rickon what would i do even more so what would catelyn do if it were jons life against the children of her body he did not know he prayed he never would all three are jaimes he said it was not a question thank the gods the seed is strong jon arryn had cried on his deathbed and so it was all those bastards all with hair as black as night grand maester malleon recorded the last mating between stag and lion some ninety years ago when tya lannister wed gowen baratheon third son of the reigning lord their only issue an unnamed boy described in malleons tome as a large and lusty lad born with a full head of black hair died in infancy thirty years before that a male lannister had taken a baratheon maid to wife she had given him three daughters and a son each blackhaired no matter how far back ned searched in the brittle yellowed pages always he found the gold yielding before the coal a dozen years ned said how is it that you have had no children by the king she lifted her head defiant your robert got me with child once she said her voice thick with contempt my brother found a woman to cleanse me he never knew if truth be told i can scarcely bear for him to touch me and i have not let him inside me for years i know other ways to pleasure him when he leaves his whores long enough to stagger up to my bedchamber whatever we do the king is usually so drunk that hes forgotten it all by the next morning how could they have all been so blind the truth was there in front of them all the time written on the childrens faces ned felt sick i remember robert as he was the day he took the throne every inch a king he said quietly a thousand other women might have loved him with all their hearts what did he do to make you hate him so her eyes burned green fire in the dusk like the lioness that was her sigil the night of our wedding feast the first time we shared a bed he called me by your sisters name he was on top of me in me stinking of wine and he whispered lyanna ned stark thought of pale blue roses and for a moment he wanted to weep i do not know which of you i pity most page the queen seemed amused by that save your pity for yourself lord stark i want none of it you know what i must do must she put her hand on his good leg just above the knee a true man does what he will not what he must her fingers brushed lightly against his thigh the gentlest of promises the realm needs a strong hand joff will not come of age for years no one wants war again least of all me her hand touched his face his hair if friends can turn to enemies enemies can become friends your wife is a thousand leagues away and my brother has fled be kind to me ned i swear to you you shall never regret it did you make the same offer to jon arryn she slapped him i shall wear that as a badge of honor ned said dryly honor she spat how dare you play the noble lord with me what do you take me for youve a bastard of your own ive seen him who was the mother i wonder some dornish peasant you raped while her holdfast burned a whore or was it the grieving sister the lady ashara she threw herself into the sea im told why was that for the brother you slew or the child you stole tell me my honorable lord eddard how are you any different from robert or me or jaime for a start said ned i do not kill children you would do well to listen my lady i shall say this only once when the king returns from his hunt i intend to lay the truth before him you must be gone by then you and your children all three and not to casterly rock if i were you i should take ship for the free cities or even farther to the summer isles or the port of ibben as far as the winds blow exile she said a bitter cup to drink from a sweeter cup than your father served rhaegars children ned said and kinder than you deserve your father and your brothers would do well to go with you lord tywins gold will buy you comfort and hire swords to keep you safe you shall need them i promise you no matter where you flee roberts wrath will follow you to the back of beyond if need be the queen stood and what of my wrath lord stark she asked softly her eyes searched his face you should have taken the realm for yourself it was there for the taking jaime told me how you found him on the iron throne the day kings landing fell and made him yield it up that was your moment all you needed to do was climb those steps and sit such a sad mistake i have made more mistakes than you can possibly imagine ned said but that was not one of them oh but it was my lord cersei insisted when you play the game of thrones you win or you die there is no middle ground she turned up her hood to hide her swollen face and left him there in the dark beneath the oak amidst the quiet of the godswood under a blueblack sky the stars were coming out page daenerys the heart was steaming in the cool evening air when khal drogo set it before her raw and bloody his arms were red to the elbow behind him his bloodriders knelt on the sand beside the corpse of the wild stallion stone knives in their hands the stallions blood looked black in the flickering orange glare of the torches that ringed the high chalk walls of the pit dany touched the soft swell of her belly sweat beaded her skin and trickled down her brow she could feel the old women watching her the ancient crones of vaes dothrak with eyes that shone dark as polished flint in their wrinkled faces she must not flinch or look afraid i am the blood of the dragon she told herself as she took the stallions heart in both hands lifted it to her mouth and plunged her teeth into the tough stringy flesh warm blood filled her mouth and ran down over her chin the taste threatened to gag her but she made herself chew and swallow the heart of a stallion would make her son strong and swift and fearless or so the dothraki believed but only if the mother could eat it all if she choked on the blood or retched up the flesh the omens were less favorable the child might be stillborn or come forth weak deformed or female her handmaids had helped her ready herself for the ceremony despite the tender mothers stomach that had afflicted her these past two moons dany had dined on bowls of halfclotted blood to accustom herself to the taste and irri made her chew strips of dried horseflesh until her jaws were aching she had starved herself for a day and a night before the ceremony in the hopes that hunger would help her keep down the raw meat the wild stallions heart was all muscle and dany had to worry it with her teeth and chew each mouthful a long time no steel was permitted within the sacred confines of vaes dothrak beneath the shadow of the mother of mountains she had to rip the heart apart with teeth and nails her stomach roiled and heaved yet she kept on her face smeared with the heartsblood that sometimes seemed to explode against her lips khal drogo stood over her as she ate his face as hard as a bronze shield his long black braid was shiny with oil he wore gold rings in his mustache gold bells in his braid and a heavy belt of solid gold medallions around his waist but his chest was bare she looked at him whenever she felt her strength failing looked at him and chewed and swallowed chewed and swallowed chewed and swallowed toward the end dany thought she glimpsed a fierce pride in his dark almondshaped eyes but she could not be sure the khals face did not often betray the thoughts within and finally it was done her cheeks and fingers were sticky as she forced down the last of it only then did she turn her eyes back to the old women the crones of the dosh khaleen khalakka dothrae mranha she proclaimed in her best dothraki a prince tides inside me she had practiced the phrase for days with her handmaid jhiqui the oldest of the crones a bent and shriveled stick of a woman with a single black eye raised her arms on high khalakka dothrae she shrieked the prince is tiding page he is tiding the other women answered rakh rakh rakh haj they proclaimed a boy a boy a strong boy bells rang a sudden clangor of bronze birds a deepthroated warhorn sounded its long low note the old women began to chant underneath their painted leather vests their withered dugs swayed back and forth shiny with oil and sweat the eunuchs who served them threw bundles of dried grasses into a great bronze brazier and clouds of fragrant smoke rose up toward the moon and the stars the dothraki believed the stars were horses made of fire a great herd that galloped across the sky by night as the smoke ascended the chanting died away and the ancient crone closed her single eye the better to peer into the future the silence that fell was complete dany could hear the distant call of night birds the hiss and crackle of the torches the gentle lapping of water from the lake the dothraki stared at her with eyes of night waiting khal drogo laid his hand on danys arm she could feel the tension in his fingers even a khal as mighty as drogo could know fear when the dosh khaleen peered into smoke of the future at her back her handmaids fluttered anxiously finally the crone opened her eye and lifted her arms i have seen his face and heard the thunder of his hooves she proclaimed in a thin wavery voice the thunder of his hooves the others chorused as swift as the wind he rides and behind him his khalasar covers the earth men without number with arakhs shining in their hands like blades of razor grass fierce as a storm this prince will be his enemies will tremble before him and their wives will weep tears of blood and rend their flesh in grief the bells in his hair will sing his coming and the milk men in the stone tents will fear his name the old woman trembled and looked at dany almost as if she were afraid the prince is riding and he shall be the stallion who mounts the world the stallion who mounts the world the onlookers cried in echo until the night rang to the sound of their voices the oneeyed crone peered at dany what shall he be called the stallion who mounts the world she stood to answer he shall be called rhaego she said using the words that jhiqui had taught her her hands touched the swell beneath her breasts protectively as a roar went up from the dothraki rhaego they screamed rhaego rhaego rhaego the name was still ringing in her ears as khal drogo led her from the pit his bloodriders fell in behind them a procession followed them out onto the godsway the broad grassy road that ran through the heart of vaes dothrak from the horse gate to the mother of mountains the crones of the dosh khaleen came first with their eunuchs and slaves some supported themselves with tall carved staffs as they struggled along on ancient shaking legs while others walked as proud as any horselord each of the old women had been a khaleesi once when their lord husbands died and a new khal took his place at the front of his riders with a new khaleesi mounted beside him they were sent here to reign over the vast dothraki nation even the mightiest of khals bowed to the wisdom and authority of the dosh khaleen page still it gave dany the shivers to think that one day she might be sent to join them whether she willed it or no behind the wise women came the others khal ogo and his son the khalakka fogo khal jommo and his wives the chief men of drogos khalasar danys handmaids the khals servants and slaves and more bells rang and drums beat a stately cadence as they marched along the godsway stolen heroes and the gods of dead peoples brooded in the darkness beyond the road alongside the procession slaves ran lightly through the grass with torches in their hands and the flickering flames made the great monuments seem almost alive what is meaning name rhaego khal drogo asked as they walked using the common tongue of the seven kingdoms she had been teaching him a few words when she could drogo was quick to learn when he put his mind to it though his accent was so thick and barbarous that neither ser jorah nor viserys could understand a word he said my brother rhaegar was a fierce warrior my sunandstars she told him he died before i was born ser jorah says that he was the last of the dragons khal drogo looked down at her his face was a copper mask yet under the long black mustache drooping beneath the weight of its gold rings she thought she glimpsed the shadow of a smile is good name dan ares wife moon of my life he said they rode to the lake the dothraki called the womb of the world surrounded by a fringe of reeds its water still and calm a thousand thousand years ago jhiqui told her the first man had emerged from its depths riding upon the back of the first horse the procession waited on the grassy shore as dany stripped and let her soiled clothing fall to the ground naked she stepped gingerly into the water irri said the lake had no bottom but dany felt soft mud squishing between her toes as she pushed through the tall reeds the moon floated on the still black waters shattering and reforming as her ripples washed over it goose pimples rose on her pale skin as the coldness crept up her thighs and kissed her lower lips the stallions blood had dried on her hands and around her mouth dany cupped her fingers and lifted the sacred waters over her head cleansing herself and the child inside her while the khal and the others looked on she heard the old women of the dosh khaleen muttering to each other as they watched and wondered what they were saying when she emerged from the lake shivering and dripping her handmaid doreah hurried to her with a robe of painted sandsilk but khal drogo waved her away he was looking on her swollen breasts and the curve of her belly with approval and dany could see the shape of his manhood pressing through his horsehide trousers below the heavy gold medallions of his belt she went to him and helped him unlace then her huge khal took her by the hips and lifted her into the air as he might lift a child the bells in his hair rang softly dany wrapped her arms around his shoulders and pressed her face against his neck as he thrust himself inside her three quick strokes and it was done the stallion who mounts the world drogo whispered hoarsely his hands still smelled of horse blood he bit at her throat hard in the moment of his pleasure page and when he lifted her off his seed filled her and trickled down the inside of her thighs only then was doreah permitted to drape her in the scented sandsilk and irri to fit soft slippers to her feet khal drogo laced himself up and spoke a command and horses were brought to the lakeshore cohollo had the honor of helping the khaleesi onto her silver drogo spurred his stallion and set off down the godsway beneath the moon and stars on her silver dany easily kept pace the silk tenting that roofed khal drogos hall had been rolled up tonight and the moon followed them inside flames leapt ten feet in the air from three huge stonelined firepits the air was thick with the smells of roasting meat and curdled fermented mares milk the hall was crowded and noisy when they entered the cushions packed with those whose rank and name were not sufficient to allow them at the ceremony as dany rode beneath the arched entry and up the center aisle every eye was on her the dothraki screamed out comments on her belly and her breasts hailing the life within her she could not understand all they shouted but one phrase came clear the stallion that mounts the world she heard bellowed in a thousand voices the sounds of drums and horns swirled up into the night halfclothed women spun and danced on the low tables amid joints of meat and platters piled high with plums and dates and pomegranates many of the men were drunk on clotted mares milk yet dany knew no arakhs would clash tonight not here in the sacred city where blades and bloodshed were forbidden khal drogo dismounted and took his place on the high bench khal jommo and khal ogo who had been in vaes dothrak with their khalasars when they arrived were given seats of high honor to drogos right and left the bloodriders of the three khals sat below them and farther down khal jommos four wives dany climbed off her silver and gave the reins to one of the slaves as doreah and irri arranged her cushions she searched for her brother even across the length of the crowded hall viserys should have been conspicuous with his pale skin silvery hair and beggars rags but she did not see him anywhere her glance roamed the crowded tables near the walls where men whose braids were even shorter than their manhoods sat on frayed rugs and flat cushions around the low tables but all the faces she saw had black eyes and copper skin she spied ser jorah mormont near the center of the hall close to the middle firepit it was a place of respect if not high honor the dothraki esteemed the knights prowess with a sword dany sent jhiqui to bring him to her table mormont came at once and went to one knee before her khaleesi he said i am yours to command she patted the stuffed horsehide cushion beside her sit and talk with me you honor me the knight seated himself crosslegged on the cushion a slave knelt before him offering a wooden platter full of ripe figs ser jorah took one and bit it in half where is my brother dany asked he ought to have come by now for the feast i saw his grace this morning he told her he told me he was going to the western market in search of wine wine dany said doubtfully viserys could not abide the taste of the fermented mares milk the dothraki drank she knew that and he was oft at the bazaars these days drinking with the traders who page came in the great caravans from east and west he seemed to find their company more congenial than hers wine ser jorah confirmed and he has some thought to recruit men for his army from the sellswords who guard the caravans a serving girl laid a blood pie in front of him and he attacked it with both hands is that wise she asked he has no gold to pay soldiers what if hes betrayed caravan guards were seldom troubled much by thoughts of honor and the usurper in kings landing would pay well for her brothers head you ought to have gone with him to keep him safe you are his sworn sword we are in vaes dothrak he reminded her no one may carry a blade here or shed a mans blood yet men die she said jhogo told me some of the traders have eunuchs with them huge men who strangle thieves with wisps of silk that way no blood is shed and the gods are not angered then let us hope your brother will be wise enough not to steal anything ser jorah wiped the grease off his mouth with the back of his hand and leaned close over the table he had planned to take your dragons eggs until i warned him that id cut off his hand if he so much as touched them for a moment dany was so shocked she had no words my eggs but theyre mine magister illyrio gave them to me a bride gift why would viserys want theyre only stones the same could be said of rubies and diamonds and fire opals princess and dragons eggs are rarer by far those traders hes been drinking with would sell their own manhoods for even one of those stones and with all three viserys could buy as many sellswords as he might need dany had not known had not even suspected then he should have them he does not need to steal them he had only to ask he is my brother and my true king he is your brother ser jorah acknowledged you do not understand ser she said my mother died giving me birth and my father and my brother rhaegar even before that i would never have known so much as their names if viserys had not been there to tell me he was the only one left the only one he is all i have once said ser jorah no longer khaleesi you belong to the dothraki now in your womb rides the stallion who mounts the world he held out his cup and a slave filled it with fermented mares milk soursmelling and thick with clots dany waved her away even the smell of it made her feel ill and she would take no chances of bringing up the horse heart she had forced herself to eat what does it mean she asked what is this stallion everyone was shouting it at me but i dont understand the stallion is the khal of khals promised in ancient prophecy child he will unite the dothraki into a single khalasar and ride to the ends of the earth or so it was promised all the people of the world will be his herd oh dany said in a small voice her hand smoothed her robe down over the swell of her stomach i page named him rhaego a name to make the usurpers blood run cold suddenly doreah was tugging at her elbow my lady the handmaid whispered urgently your brother dany looked down the length of the long roofless hall and there he was striding toward her from the lurch in his step she could tell at once that viserys had found his wine and something that passed for courage he was wearing his scarlet silks soiled and travelstained his cloak and gloves were black velvet faded from the sun his boots were dry and cracked his silverblond hair matted and tangled a longsword swung from his belt in a leather scabbard the dothraki eyed the sword as he passed dany heard curses and threats and angry muttering rising all around her like a tide the music died away in a nervous stammering of drums a sense of dread closed around her heart go to him she commanded ser jorah stop him bring him here tell him he can have the dragons eggs if that is what he wants the knight rose swiftly to his feet where is my sister viserys shouted his voice thick with wine ive come for her feast how dare you presume to eat without me no one eats before the king where is she the whore cant hide from the dragon he stopped beside the largest of the three firepits peering around at the faces of the dothraki there were five thousand men in the hall but only a handful who knew the common tongue yet even if his words were incomprehensible you had only to look at him to know that he was drunk ser jorah went to him swiftly whispered something in his ear and took him by the arm but viserys wrenched free keep your hands off me no one touches the dragon without leave dany glanced anxiously up at the high bench khal drogo was saying something to the other khals beside him khal jommo grinned and khal ogo began to guffaw loudly the sound of laughter made viserys lift his eyes khal drogo he said thickly his voice almost polite im here for the feast he staggered away from ser jorah making to join the three khals on the high bench khal drogo rose spat out a dozen words in dothraki faster than dany could understand and pointed khal drogo says your place is not on the high bench ser jorah translated for her brother khal drogo says your place is there viserys glanced where the khal was pointing at the back of the long hall in a corner by the wall deep in shadow so better men would not need to look on them sat the lowest of the low raw unblooded boys old men with clouded eyes and stiff joints the dimwitted and the maimed far from the meat and farther from honor that is no place for a king her brother declared page is place khal drogo answered in the common tongue that dany had taught him for sorefoot king he clapped his hands together a cart bring cart for khal rhaggat five thousand dothraki began to laugh and shout ser jorah was standing beside viserys screaming in his ear but the roar in the hall was so thunderous that dany could not hear what he was saying her brother shouted back and the two men grappled until mormont knocked viserys bodily to the floor her brother drew his sword the bared steel shone a fearful red in the glare from the firepits keep away from me viserys hissed ser jorah backed off a step and her brother climbed unsteadily to his feet he waved the sword over his head the borrowed blade that magister illyrio had given him to make him seem more kingly dothraki were shrieking at him from all sides screaming vile curses dany gave a wordless cry of terror she knew what a drawn sword meant here even if her brother did not her voice made viserys turn his head and he saw her for the first time there she is he said smiling he stalked toward her slashing at the air as if to cut a path through a wall of enemies though no one tried to bar his way the blade you must not she begged him please viserys it is forbidden put down the sword and come share my cushions theres drink food is it the dragons eggs you want you can have them only throw away the sword do as she tells you fool ser jorah shouted before you get us all killed viserys laughed they cant kill us they cant shed blood here in the sacred city but i can he laid the point of his sword between daeneryss breasts and slid it downward over the curve of her belly i want what i came for he told her i want the crown he promised me he bought you but he never paid for you tell him i want what i bargained for or im taking you back you and the eggs both he can keep his bloody foal ill cut the bastard out and leave it for him the sword point pushed through her silks and pricked at her navel viserys was weeping she saw weeping and laughing both at the same time this man who had once been her brother distantly as from far away dany heard her handmaid jhiqui sobbing in fear pleading that she dared not translate that the khal would bind her and drag her behind his horse all the way up the mother of mountains she put her arm around the girl dont be afraid she said i shall tell him she did not know if she had enough words yet when she was done khal drogo spoke a few brusque sentences in dothraki and she knew he understood the sun of her life stepped down from the high bench what did he say the man who had been her brother asked her flinching page it had grown so silent in the hall that she could hear the bells in khal drogos hair chiming softly with each step he took his bloodriders followed him like three copper shadows daenerys had gone cold all over he says you shall have a splendid golden crown that men shall tremble to behold viserys smiled and lowered his sword that was the saddest thing the thing that tore at her afterward the way he smiled that was all i wanted he said what was promised when the sun of her life reached her dany slid an arm around his waist the khal said a word and his bloodriders leapt forward qotho seized the man who had been her brother by the arms haggo shattered his wrist with a single sharp twist of his huge hands cohollo pulled the sword from his limp fingers even now viserys did not understand no he shouted you cannot touch me i am the dragon the dragon and i will be crowned khal drogo unfastened his belt the medallions were pure gold massive and ornate each one as large as a mans hand he shouted a command cook slaves pulled a heavy iron stew pot from the firepit dumped the stew onto the ground and returned the pot to the flames drogo tossed in the belt and watched without expression as the medallions turned red and began to lose their shape she could see fires dancing in the onyx of his eyes a slave handed him a pair of thick horsehair mittens and he pulled them on never so much as looking at the man viserys began to scream the high wordless scream of the coward facing death he kicked and twisted whimpered like a dog and wept like a child but the dothraki held him tight between them ser jorah had made his way to danys side he put a hand on her shoulder turn away my princess i beg you no she folded her arms across the swell of her belly protectively at the last viserys looked at her sister please dany tell them make them sweet sister when the gold was halfmelted and starting to run drogo reached into the flames snatched out the pot crown he roared here a crown for cart king and upended the pot over the head of the man who had been her brother the sound viserys targaryen made when that hideous iron helmet covered his face was like nothing human his feet hammered a frantic beat against the dirt floor slowed stopped thick globs of molten gold dripped down onto his chest setting the scarlet silk to smoldering yet no drop of blood was spilled he was no dragon dany thought curiously calm fire cannot kill a dragon eddard he was walking through the crypts beneath winterfell as he hhad walked a thousand times before the kings of winter atched him pass with eyes of ice and the direwolves at their feet turned their great stone heads and snarled last of all he came to the tomb where his father slept with brandon and lyanna beside him promise me ned lyannas statue whispered she wore a garland of pale blue roses and page her eyes wept blood eddard stark jerked upright his heart racing the blankets tangled around him the room was black as pitch and someone was hammering on the door lord eddard a voice called loudly a moment groggy and naked he stumbled his way across the darkened chamber when he opened the door he found tomard with an upraised fist and cayn with a taper in hand between them stood the kings own steward the mans face might have been carved of stone so little did it show my lord hand he intoned his grace the king commands your presence at once so robert had returned from his hunt it was long past time i shall need a few moments to dress ned left the man waiting without cayn helped him with his clothes white linen tunic and grey cloak trousers cut open down his plastersheathed leg his badge of office and last of all a belt of heavy silver links he sheathed the valyrian dagger at his waist the red keep was dark and still as cayn and tomard escorted him across the inner bailey the moon hung low over the walls ripening toward full on the ramparts a guardsman in a gold cloak walked his rounds the royal apartments were in maegors holdfast a massive square fortress that nestled in the heart of the red keep behind walls twelve feet thick and a dry moat lined with iron spikes a castlewithinacastle ser boros blount guarded the far end of the bridge white steel armor ghostly in the moonlight within ned passed two other knights of the kingsguard ser preston greenfield stood at the bottom of the steps and ser barristan selmy waited at the door of the kings bedchamber three men in white cloaks he thought remembering and a strange chill went through him ser barristans face was as pale as his armor ned had only to look at him to know that something was dreadfully wrong the royal steward opened the door lord eddard stark the hand of the king he announced bring him here roberts voice called strangely thick fires blazed in the twin hearths at either end of the bedchamber filling the room with a sullen red glare the heat within was suffocating robert lay across the canopied bed at the bedside hovered grand maester pycelle while lord renly paced restlessly before the shuttered windows servants moved back and forth feeding logs to the fire and boiling wine cersei lannister sat on the edge of the bed beside her husband her hair was tousled as if from sleep but there was nothing sleepy in her eyes they followed ned as tomard and cayn helped him cross the room he seemed to move very slowly as if he were still dreaming the king still wore his boots ned could see dried mud and blades of grass clinging to the leather where roberts feet stuck out beneath the blanket that covered him a green doublet lay on the floor slashed open and discarded the cloth crusted with redbrown stains the room smelled of smoke and blood and death ned the king whispered when he saw him his face was pale as milk come closer his men brought him close ned steadied himself with a hand on the bedpost he had only to look down page at robert to know how bad it was what he began his throat clenched a boar lord renly was still in his hunting greens his cloak spattered with blood a devil the king husked my own fault too much wine damn me to hell missed my thrust and where were the rest of you ned demanded of lord renly where was ser barristan and the kingsguard renlys mouth twitched my brother commanded us to stand aside and let him take the boar alone eddard stark lifted the blanket they had done what they could to close him up but it was nowhere near enough the boar must have been a fearsome thing it had ripped the king from groin to nipple with its tusks the winesoaked bandages that grand maester pycelle had applied were already black with blood and the smell off the wound was hideous neds stomach turned he let the blanket fall stinks robert said the stink of death dont think i cant smell it bastard did me good eh but i i paid him back in kind ned the kings smile was as terrible as his wound his teeth red drove a knife right through his eye ask them if i didnt ask them truly lord renly murmured we brought the carcass back with us at my brothers command for the feast robert whispered now leave us the lot of you i need to speak with ned robert my sweet lord cersei began i said leave robert insisted with a hint of his old fierceness what part of that dont you understand woman cersei gathered up her skirts and her dignity and led the way to the door lord renly and the others followed grand maester pycelle lingered his hands shaking as he offered the king a cup of thick white liquid the milk of the poppy your grace he said drink for your pain robert knocked the cup away with the back of his hand away with you ill sleep soon enough old fool get out grand maester pycelle gave ned a stricken look as he shuffled from the room damn you robert ned said when they were alone his leg was throbbing so badly he was almost blind with pain or perhaps it was grief that fogged his eyes he lowered himself to the bed beside his friend why do you always have to be so headstrong ah fuck you ned the king said hoarsely i killed the bastard didnt it a lock of matted black hair fell across his eyes as he glared up at ned ought to do the same for you cant leave a man to hunt in peace ser robar found me gregors head ugly thought never told the hound let cersei surprise him his laugh turned into a grunt as page a spasm of pain hit him gods have mercy he muttered swallowing his agony the girl daenerys only a child you were right thats why the girl the gods sent the boar sent to punish me the king coughed bringing up blood wrong it was wrong i only a girl varys littlefinger even my brother worthless no one to tell me no but you ned only you he lifted his hand the gesture pained and feeble paper and ink there on the table write what i tell you ned smoothed the paper out across his knee and took up the quill at your command your grace this is the will and word of robert of house baratheon the first of his name king of the andals and all the restput in the damn titles you know how it goes i do hereby command eddard of house stark lord of winterfell and hand of the king to serve as lord regent and protector of the realm upon my upon my death to rule in my in my stead until my son joffrey does come of age robert joffirey is not your son he wanted to say but the words would not come the agony was written too plainly across roberts face he could not hurt him more so ned bent his head and wrote but where the king had said my son joffrey he scrawled my heir instead the deceit made him feel soiled the lies we tellfor love he thought may the gods forgive me what else would you have me say say whatever you need to protect and defend gods old and new you have the words write ill sign it you give it to the council when im dead robert ned said in a voice thick with grief you must not do this dont die on me the realm needs you robert took his hand fingers squeezing hard you are such a bad liar ned stark he said through his pain the realm the realm knows what a wretched king ive been bad as aerys the gods spare me no ned told his dying friend not so bad as aerys your grace not near so bad as aerys robert managed a weak red smile at the least they will say this last thing this i did right you wont fail me youll rule now youll hate it worse than i did but youll do well are you done with the scribbling yes your grace ned offered robert the paper the king scrawled his signature blindly leaving a smear of blood across the letter the seal should be witnessed serve the boar at my funeral feast robert rasped apple in its mouth skin seared crisp eat the bastard dont care if you choke on him promise me ned i promise promise me ned lyannas voice echoed the girl the king said daenerys let her live if you can if it not too late talk to them varys littlefinger dont let them kill her and help my son ned make him be better than me he winced gods have mercy page they will my friend ned said they will the king closed his eyes and seemed to relax killed by a pig he muttered ought to laugh but it hurts too much ned was not laughing shall i call them back robert gave a weak nod as you will gods why is it so cold in here the servants rushed back in and hurried to feed the fires the queen had gone that was some small relief at least if she had any sense cersei would take her children and fly before the break of day ned thought she had lingered too long already king robert did not seem to miss her he bid his brother renly and grand maester pycelle to stand in witness as he pressed his seal into the hot yellow wax that ned had dripped upon his letter now give me something for the pain and let me die hurriedly grand maester pycelle mixed him another draught of the milk of the poppy this time the king drank deeply his black beard was beaded with thick white droplets when he threw the empty cup aside will i dream ned gave him his answer you will my lord good he said smiling i will give lyanna your love ned take care of my children for me the words twisted in neds belly like a knife for a moment he was at a loss he could not bring himself to lie then he remembered the bastards little barra at her mothers breast mya in the vale gendry at his forge and all the others i shall guard your children as if they were my own he said slowly robert nodded and closed his eyes ned watched his old friend sag softly into the pillows as the milk of the poppy washed the pain from his face sleep took him heavy chains jangled softly as grand maester pycelle came up to ned i will do all in my power my lord but the wound has mortified it took them two days to get him back by the time i saw him it was too late i can lessen his graces suffering but only the gods can heal him now how long ned asked by rights he should be dead already i have never seen a man cling to life so fiercely my brother was always strong lord renly said not wise perhaps but strong in the sweltering heat of the bedchamber his brow was slick with sweat he might have been roberts ghost as he stood there young and dark and handsome he slew the boar his entrails were sliding from his belly yet somehow he slew the boar his voice was full of wonder robert was never a man to leave the battleground so long as a foe remained standing ned told him outside the door ser barristan selmy still guarded the tower stairs maester pycelle has given robert the milk of the poppy ned told him see that no one disturbs his rest without leave from me page it shall be as you command my lord ser barristan seemed old beyond his years i have failed my sacred trust even the truest knight cannot protect a king against himself ned said robert loved to hunt boar i have seen him take a thousand of them he would stand his ground without flinching his legs braced the great spear in his hands and as often as not he would curse the boar as it charged and wait until the last possible second until it was almost on him before he killed it with a single sure and savage thrust no one could know this one would be his death you are kind to say so lord eddard the king himself said as much he blamed the wine the whitehaired knight gave a weary nod his grace was reeling in his saddle by the time we flushed the boar from his lair yet he commanded us all to stand aside i wonder ser barristan asked varys so quietly who gave the king this wine ned had not heard the eunuch approach but when he looked around there he stood he wore a black velvet robe that brushed the floor and his face was freshly powdered the wine was from the kings own skin ser barristan said only one skin hunting is such thirsty work i did not keep count more than one for a certainty his squire would fetch him a fresh skin whenever he required it such a dutiful boy said varys to make certain his grace did not lack for refreshment ned had a bitter taste in his mouth he recalled the two fairhaired boys robert had sent chasing after a breastplate stretcher the king had told everyone the tale that night at the feast laughing until he shook which squire the elder said ser barristan lancel i know the lad well said varys a stalwart boy ser kevan lannisters son nephew to lord tywin and cousin to the queen i hope the dear sweet lad does not blame himself children are so vulnerable in the innocence of their youth how well do i remember certainly varys had once been young ned doubted that he had ever been innocent you mention children robert had a change of heart concerning daenerys targaryen whatever arrangements you made i want unmade at once alas said varys at once may be too late i fear those birds have flown but i shall do what i can my lord with your leave he bowed and vanished down the steps his softsoled slippers whispering against the stone as he made his descent page cayn and tomard were helping ned across the bridge when lord renly emerged from maegors holdfast lord eddard he called after ned a moment if you would be so kind ned stopped as you wish renly walked to his side send your men away they met in the center of the bridge the dry moat beneath them moonlight silvered the cruel edges of the spikes that lined its bed ned gestured tomard and cayn bowed their heads and backed away respectfully lord renly glanced warily at ser boros on the far end of the span at ser preston in the doorway behind them that letter he leaned close was it the regency has my brother named you protector he did not wait for a reply my lord i have thirty men in my personal guard and other friends beside knights and lords give me an hour and i can put a hundred swords in your hand and what should i do with a hundred swords my lord strike now while the castle sleeps renly looked back at ser boros again and dropped his voice to an urgent whisper we must get joffrey away from his mother and take him in hand protector or no the man who holds the king holds the kingdom we should seize myrcella and tommen as well once we have her children cersei will not dare oppose us the council will confirm you as lord protector and make joffrey your ward ned regarded him coldly robert is not dead yet the gods may spare him if not i shall convene the council to hear his final words and consider the matter of the succession but i will not dishonor his last hours on earth by shedding blood in his halls and dragging frightened children from their beds lord renly took a step back taut as a bowstring every moment you delay gives cersei another moment to prepare by the time robert dies it may be too late for both of us then we should pray that robert does not die small chance of that said renly sometimes the gods are merciful the lannisters are not lord renly turned away and went back across the moat to the tower where his brother lay dying by the time ned returned to his chambers he felt weary and heartsick yet there was no question of his going back to sleep not now when you play the game of thrones you win or you die cersei lannister had told him in the godswood he found himself wondering if he had done the right thing by refusing lord renlys offer he had no taste for these intrigues and there was no honor in threatening children and yet if cersei elected to fight rather than flee he might well have need of renlys hundred swords and more besides i want littlefinger he told cayn if hes not in his chambers take as many men as you need and search every winesink and whorehouse in kings landing until you find him bring him to me before break of day cayn bowed and took his leave and ned turned to tomard the wind witch sails on page the evening tide have you chosen the escort ten men with porther in command twenty and you will command ned said porther was a brave man but headstrong he wanted someone more solid and sensible to keep watch over his daughters as you wish mlord tom said cant say ill be sad to see the back of this place i miss the wife you will pass near dragonstone when you turn north i need you to deliver a letter for me tom looked apprehensive to dragonstone mlord the island fortress of house targaryen had a sinister repute tell captain qos to hoist my banner as soon as he comes in sight of the island they may be wary of unexpected visitors if he is reluctant offer him whatever it takes i will give you a letter to place into the hand of lord stannis baratheon no one else not his steward nor the captain of his guard nor his lady wife but only lord stannis himself as you command mord when tomard had left him lord eddard stark sat staring at the flame of the candle that burned beside him on the table for a moment his grief overwhelmed him he wanted nothing so much as to seek out the godswood to kneel before the heart tree and pray for the life of robert baratheon who had been more than a brother to him men would whisper afterward that eddard stark had betrayed his kings friendship and disinherited his sons he could only hope that the gods would know better and that robert would learn the truth of it in the land beyond the grave ned took out the kings last letter a roll of crisp white parchment sealed with golden wax a few short words and a smear of blood how small the difference between victory and defeat between life and death he drew out a fresh sheet of paper and dipped his quill in the inkpot to his grace stannis of the house baratheon he wrote by the time you receive this letter your brother robert our king these past fifteen years will be dead he was savaged by a boar whilst hunting in the kingswood the letters seemed to writhe and twist on the paper as his hand trailed to a stop lord tywin and ser jaime were not men to suffer disgrace meekly they would fight rather than flee no doubt lord stannis was wary after the murder of jon arryn but it was imperative that he sail for kings landing at once with all his power before the lannisters could march ned chose each word with care when he was done he signed the letter eddard stark lord of winterfell hand of the king and protector of the realm blotted the paper folded it twice and melted the sealing wax over the candle flame his regency would be a short one he reflected as the wax softened the new king would choose his own hand ned would be free to go home the thought of winterfell brought a wan smile to his face he wanted to hear brans laughter once more to go hawking with robb to watch rickon at play he page wanted to drift off to a dreamless sleep in his own bed with his arms wrapped tight around his lady catelyn cayn returned as he was pressing the direwolf seal down into the soft white wax desmond was with him and between them littlefinger ned thanked his guards and sent them away lord petyr was clad in a blue velvet tunic with puffed sleeves his silvery cape patterned with mockingbirds i suppose congratulations are in order he said as he seated himself ned scowled the king lies wounded and near to death i know littlefinger said i also know that robert has named you protector of the realm neds eyes flicked to the kings letter on the table beside him its seal unbroken and how is it you know that my lord varys hinted as much littlefinger said and you have just confirmed it neds mouth twisted in anger damn varys and his little birds catelyn spoke truly the man has some black art i do not trust him excellent youre learning littlefinger leaned forward yet ill wager you did not drag me here in the black of night to discuss the eunuch no ned admitted i know the secret jon arryn was murdered to protect robert will leave no trueborn son behind him joffrey and tommen are jaime lannisters bastards born of his incestuous union with the queen littlefinger lifted an eyebrow shocking he said in a tone that suggested he was not shocked at all the girl as well no doubt so when the king dies the throne by rights passes to lord stannis the elder of roberts two brothers lord petyr stroked his pointed beard as he considered the matter so it would seem unless unless my lord there is no seeming to this stannis is the heir nothing can change that stannis cannot take the throne without your help if youre wise youll make certain joffrey succeeds ned gave him a stony stare have you no shred of honor oh a shred surely littlefinger replied negligently hear me out stannis is no friend of yours nor of mine even his brothers can scarcely stomach him the man is iron hard and unyielding hell give us a new hand and a new council for a certainty no doubt hell thank you for handing him the crown but he wont love you for it and his ascent will mean war stannis cannot rest easy on the throne until cersei and her bastards are dead do you think lord tywin will sit idly while his daughters head is measured for a spike casterly rock will rise and not alone robert found it in him to pardon men who served king aerys so long as they did him fealty stannis is less forgiving he will not have forgotten the siege of storms end and the lords tyrell and redwyne dare not every man who fought beneath the dragon page banner or rose with balon greyjoy will have good cause to fear seat stannis on the iron throne and i promise you the realm will bleed now look at the other side of the coin joffrey is but twelve and robert gave you the regency my lord you are the hand of the king and protector of the realm the power is yours lord stark all you need do is reach out and take it make your peace with the lannisters release the imp wed joffrey to your sansa wed your younger girl to prince tommen and your heir to myrcella it will be four years before joffrey comes of age by then he will look to you as a second father and if not well four years is a good long while my lord long enough to dispose of lord stannis then should joffrey prove troublesome we can reveal his little secret and put lord renly on the throne we ned repeated littlefinger gave a shrug youll need someone to share your burdens i assure you my price would be modest your price neds voice was ice lord baelish what you suggest is treason only if we lose you forget ned told him you forget jon arryn you forget jory cassel and you forget this he drew the dagger and laid it on the table between them a length of dragonbone and valyrian steel as sharp as the difference between right and wrong between true and false between life and death they sent a man to cut my sons throat lord baelish littlefinger sighed i fear i did forget my lord pray forgive me for a moment i did not remember that i was talking to a stark his mouth quirked so it will be stannis and war it is not a choice stannis is the heir far be it from me to dispute the lord protector what would you have of me then not my wisdom for a certainty i shall do my best to forget your wisdom ned said with distaste i called you here to ask for the help you promised catelyn this is a perilous hour for all of us robert has named me protector true enough but in the eyes of the world joffrey is still his son and heir the queen has a dozen knights and a hundred menatarms who will do whatever she commands enough to overwhelm what remains of my own household guard and for all i know her brother jaime may be riding for kings landing even as we speak with a lannister host at his back and you without an army littlefinger toyed with the dagger on the table turning it slowly with a finger there is small love lost between lord renly and the lannisters bronze yohn royce ser balon swann ser loras lady tanda the redwyne twins each of them has a retinue of knights and sworn swords here at court renly has thirty men in his personal guard the rest even fewer it is not enough even if i could be certain that all of them will choose to give me their allegiance i must have the gold cloaks the city page watch is two thousand strong sworn to defend the castle the city and the kings peace ah but when the queen proclaims one king and the hand another whose peace do they protect lord petyr flicked at the dagger with his finger setting it spinning in place round and round it went wobbling as it turned when at last it slowed to a stop the blade pointed at littlefinger why theres your answer he said smiling they follow the man who pays them he leaned back and looked ned full in the face his greygreen eyes bright with mockery you wear your honor like a suit of armor stark you think it keeps you safe but all it does is weigh you down and make it hard for you to move look at you now you know why you summoned me here you know what you want to ask me to do you know it has to be done but its not honorable so the words stick in your throat neds neck was rigid with tension for a moment he was so angry that he did not trust himself to speak littlefinger laughed i ought to make you say it but that would be cruel so have no fear my good lord for the sake of the love i bear for catelyn i will go to janos slynt this very hour and make certain that the city watch is yours six thousand gold pieces should do it a third for the commander a third for the officers a third for the men we might be able to buy them for half that much but i prefer not to take chances smiling he plucked up the dagger and offered it to ned hilt first jon jon was breaking his fast on applecakes and blood sausage when samwell tarly plopped himself down on the bench ive been summoned to the sept sam said in an excited whisper theyre passing me out of training im to be made a brother with the rest of you can you believe it no truly truly im to assist maester aemon with the library and the birds he needs someone who can read and write letters youll do well at that jon said smiling sam glanced about anxiously is it time to go i shouldnt be late they might change their minds he was fairly bouncing as they crossed the weedstrewn courtyard the day was warm and sunny rivulets of water trickled down the sides of the wall so the ice seemed to sparkle and shine inside the sept the great crystal caught the morning light as it streamed through the southfacing window and spread it in a rainbow on the altar pyps mouth dropped open when he caught sight of sam and toad poked grenn in the ribs but no one dared say a word septon celladar was swinging a censer filling the air with fragrant incense that reminded jon of lady starks little sept in winterfell for once the septon seemed sober the high officers arrived in a body maester aemon leaning on page clydas ser alliser coldeyed and grim lord commander mormont resplendent in a black wool doublet with silvered bearclaw fastenings behind them came the senior members of the three orders redfaced bowen marsh the lord steward first builder othell yarwyck and ser jaremy rykker who commanded the rangers in the absence of benjen stark mormont stood before the altar the rainbow shining on his broad bald head you came to us outlaws he began poachers rapers debtors killers and thieves you came to us children you came to us alone in chains with neither friends nor honor you came to us rich and you came to us poor some of you bear the names of proud houses others have only bastards names or no names at all it makes no matter all that is past now on the wall we are all one house at evenfall as the sun sets and we face the gathering night you shall take your vows from that moment you will be a sworn brother of the nights watch your crimes will be washed away your debts forgiven so too you must wash away your former loyalties put aside your grudges forget old wrongs and old loves alike here you begin anew a man of the nights watch lives his life for the realm not for a king nor a lord nor the honor of

mistress is honor and you are the only sons we shall ever know you have learned the words of the vow think carefully before you say them for once you have taken the black there is no turning back the

well and good said mormont you may take your vows here at evenfall before septon celladar and the first of your order do any of you keep to the old gods jon stood i do my lord i expect you will want to say your words before a heart tree as your uncle did mormont said yes my lord jon said the gods of the sept had nothing to do with him the blood of the first men flowed in the veins of the starks he heard grenn whispering behind him theres no godswood here is there i never saw a godswood you wouldnt see a herd of aurochs until they trampled you into the snow pyp whispered back i would so grenn insisted id see them a long way off mormont himself confirmed grenns doubts castle black has no need of a godswood beyond the wall the haunted forest stands as it stood in the dawn age long before the andals brought the seven across the narrow sea you will find a grove of weirwoods half a league from this spot and mayhap your page gods as well my lord the voice made jon glance back in surprise samwell tarly was on his feet the fat boy wiped his sweaty palms against his tunic might i might i go as well to say my words at this heart tree does house tarly keep the old gods too mormont asked no my lord sam replied in a thin nervous voice the high officers frightened him jon knew the old bear most of all i was named in the light of the seven at the sept on horn hill as my father was and his father and all the tarlys for a thousand years why would you forsake the gods of your father and your house wondered ser jaremy rykker the nights watch is my house now sam said the seven have never answered my prayers perhaps the old gods will as you wish boy mormont said sam took his seat again as did jon we have placed each of you in an order as befits our need and your own strengths and skills bowen marsh stepped forward and handed him a paper the lord commander unrolled it and began to read haider to the builders he began haider gave a stiff nod of approval grenn to the rangers albett to the builders pypar to the rangers pyp looked over at jon and wiggled his ears samwell to the stewards sam sagged with relief mopping at his brow witha scrap of silk matthar to the rangers dareon to the stewards todder to the rangers jon to the stewards the stewards for a moment jon could not believe what he had heard mormont must have read it wrong he started to rise to open his mouth to tell them there had been a mistake and then he saw ser alliser studying him eyes shiny as two flakes of obsidian and he knew the old bear rolled up the paper your firsts will instruct you in your duties may all the gods preserve you brothers the lord commander favored them with a half bow and took his leave ser alliser went with him a thin smile on his face jon had never seen the masteratarms took quite so happy rangers with me ser jaremy rykker called when they were gone pyp was staring at jon as he got slowly to his feet his ears were red grenn grinning broadly did not seem to realize that anything was amiss matt and toad fell in beside them and they followed ser jaremy from the sept builders announced lanternjawed othell yarwyck haider and albett trailed out after him jon looked around him in sick disbelief maester aemons blind eyes were raised toward the light he could not see the septon was arranging crystals on the altar only sam and darcon remained on the benches a fat boy a singer and him lord steward bowen marsh rubbed his plump hands together samwell you will assist maester aemon in the rookery and library chett is going to the kennels to help with the hounds you shall have his cell so as to be close to the maester night and day i trust you will take good care of him he is very old and very precious to us page dareon i am told that you sang at many a high lords table and shared their meat and mead we are sending you to eastwatch it may be your palate will be some help to cotter pyke when merchant galleys come trading we are paying too dear for salt beef and pickled fish and the quality of the olive oil were getting has been frightful present yourself to borcas when you arrive he will keep you busy between ships marsh turned his smile on jon lord commander mormont has requested you for his personal steward jon youll sleep in a cell beneath his chambers in the lord commanders tower and what will my duties be jon asked sharply will i serve the lord commanders meals help him fasten his clothes fetch hot water for his bath certainly marsh frowned at jons tone and you will run his messages keep a fire burning in his chambers change his sheets and blankets daily and do all else that the lord commander might require of you do you take me for a servant no maester aemon said from the back of the sept clydas helped him stand we took you for a man of nights watch but perhaps we were wrong in that it was all jon could do to stop himself from walking out was he supposed to churn butter and sew doublets like a girl for the rest of his days may i go he asked stiffly as you wish bowen marsh responded dareon and sam left with him they descended to the yard in silence outside jon looked up at the wall shining in the sun the melting ice creeping down its side in a hundred thin fingers jons rage was such that he would have smashed it all in an instant and the world be damned jon samwell tarly said excitedly wait dont you see what theyre doing jon turned on him in a fury i see ser allisers bloody hand thats all i see he wanted to shame me and he has dareon gave him a look the stewards are fine for the likes of you and me sam but not for lord snow im a better swordsman and a better rider than any of you jon blazed back its notfair fair dareon sneered the girl was waiting for me naked as the day she was born she pulled me through the window and you talk to me of fair he walked off there is no shame in being a steward sam said do you think i want to spend the rest of my life washing an old mans smallclothes page the old man is lord commander of the nights watch sam reminded him youll be with him day and night yes youll pour his wine and see that his bed linen is fresh but youll also take his letters attend him at meetings squire for him in battle youll be as close to him as his shadow youll know everything be a part of everything and the lord steward said mormont asked for you himself when i was little my father used to insist that i attend him in the audience chamber whenever he held court when he rode to highgarden to bend his knee to lord tyrell he made me come later though he started to take dickon and leave me at home and he no longer cared whether i sat through his audiences so long as dickon was there he wanted his heir at his side dont you see to watch and listen and learn from all he did ill wager thats why lord mormont requested you jon what else could it be he wants to groom you for command jon was taken aback it was true lord eddard had often made robb part of his councils back at winterfell could sam be right even a bastard could rise high in the nights watch they said i never asked for this he said stubbornly none of us are here for asking sam reminded him and suddenly jon snow was ashamed craven or not samwell tarly had found the courage to accept his fate like a man on the wall a man gets only what he earns benjen stark had said the last night jon had seen him alive youre no ranger jon only a green boy with the smell of summer still on you hed heard it said that bastards grow up faster than other children on the wall you grew up or you died jon let out a deep sigh you have the right of it i was acting the boy then youll stay and say your words with me the old gods will be expecting us he made himself smile they set out late that afternoon the wall had no gates as such neither here at castle black nor anywhere along its three hundred miles they led their horses down a narrow tunnel cut through the ice cold dark walls pressing in around them as the passage twisted and turned three times their way was blocked by iron bars and they had to stop while bowen marsh drew out his keys and unlocked the massive chains that secured them jon could sense the vast weight pressing down on him as he waited behind the lord steward the air was colder than a tomb and more still he felt a strange relief when they reemerged into the afternoon light on the north side of the wall sam blinked at the sudden glare and looked around apprehensively the wildlings they wouldnt theyd never dare come this close to the wall would they they never have jon climbed into his saddle when bowen marsh and their ranger escort had mounted jon put two fingers in his mouth and whistled ghost came loping out of the tunnel the lord stewards garron whickered and backed away from the direwolf do you mean to take that beast page yes my lord jon said ghosts head lifted he seemed to taste the air in the blink of an eye he was off racing across the broad weedchoked field to vanish in the trees once they had entered the forest they were in a different world jon had often hunted with his father and jory and his brother robb he knew the wolfswood around winterfell as well as any man the haunted forest was much the same and yet the feel of it was very different perhaps it was all in the knowing they had ridden past the end of the world somehow that changed everything every shadow seemed darker every sound more ominous the trees pressed close and shut out the light of the setting sun a thin crust of snow cracked beneath the hooves of their horses with a sound like breaking bones when the wind set the leaves to rustling it was like a chilly finger tracing a path up jons spine the wall was at their backs and only the gods knew what lay ahead the sun was sinking below the trees when they reached their destination a small clearing in the deep of the wood where nine weirwoods grew in a rough circle jon drew in a breath and be saw sam tarly staring even in the wolfswood you never found more than two or three of the white trees growing together a grove of nine was unheard of the forest floor was carpeted with fallen leaves bloodred on top black rot beneath the wide smooth trunks were bone pale and nine faces stared inward the dried sap that crusted in the eyes was red and hard as ruby bowen marsh commanded them to leave their horses outside the circle this is a sacred place we will not defile it when they entered the grove samwell tarly turned slowly looking at each face in turn no two were quite alike theyre watching us he whispered the old gods yes jon knelt and sam knelt beside him they said the words together as the last light faded in the west and grey day became black night hear my words and bear witness to my vow they recited their voices filling the twilit grove night gathers and now my watch begins it shall not end until my death i shall take no wife hold no lands father no children i shall wear no crowns and win no glory i shall live and die at my post f am the sword in the darkness i am the watcher on the walls i am the fire that burns against the cold the light that brings the dawn the horn that wakes the sleepers the shield that guards the realms of men i pledge my life and honor to the nights watch for this night and all the nights to come the woods fell silent you knelt as boys bowen marsh intoned solemnly rise now as men of the nights watch jon held out a hand to pull sam back to his feet the rangers gathered round to offer smiles and congratulations all but the gnarled old forester dywen best we be starting back mlord he said to bowen marsh darks falling and theres something in the smell o the night that i mislike and suddenly ghost was back stalking softly between two weirwoods white fur and red eyes jon realized disquieted like the trees the wolf had something in his jaws something black whats he got there asked bowen marsh page frowning to me ghost jon knelt bring it here the direwolf trotted to him jon heard samwell tarlys sharp intake of breath gods be good dywen muttered thats a hand eddard the grey light of dawn was streaming through his window when the thunder of hoofbeats awoke eddard stark from his brief exhausted sleep he lifted his head from the table to look down into the yard below men in mail and leather and crimson cloaks were making the morning ring to the sound of swords and riding down mock warriors stuffed with straw ned watched sandor clegane gallop across the hardpacked ground to drive an irontipped lance through a dummys head canvas ripped and straw exploded as lannister guardsmen joked and cursed is this brave show for my benefit he wondered if so cersei was a greater fool than hed imagined damn her he thought why is the woman not fled i have given her chance after chance the morning was overcast and grim ned broke his fast with his daughters and septa mordane sansa still disconsolate stared sullenly at her food and refused to eat but arya wolfed down everything that was set in front of her syrio says we have time for one last lesson before we take ship this evening she said can father all my things are packed a short lesson and make certain you leave yourself time to bathe and change i want you ready to leave by midday is that understood by midday arya said sansa looked up from her food if she can have a dancing lesson why wont you let me say farewell to prince joffrey i would gladly go with her lord eddard septa mordane offered there would be no question of her missing the ship it would not be wise for you to go to joffrey right now sansa im sorry sansas eyes filled with tears but why sansa your lord father knows best septa mordane said you are not to question his decisions its notfair sansa pushed back from her table knocked over her chair and ran weeping from the solar septa mordane rose but ned gestured her back to her seat let her go septa i will try to make her understand when we are all safely back in winterfell the septa bowed her head and sat down to finish page her breakfast it was an hour later when grand maester pycelle came to eddard stark in his solar his shoulders slumped as if the weight of the great maesters chain around his neck had become too great to bear my lord he said king robert is gone the gods give him rest no ned answered he hated rest the gods give him love and laughter and the joy of righteous battle it was strange how empty he felt he had been expecting the visit and yet with those words something died within him he would have given all his titles for the freedom to weep but he was roberts hand and the hour he dreaded had come be so good as to summon the members of the council here to my solar he told pycelle the tower of the hand was as secure as he and tomard could make it he could not say the same for the council chambers my lord pycelle blinked surely the affairs of the kingdom will keep till the morrow when our grief is not so fresh ned was quiet but firm i fear we must convene at once pycelle bowed as the hand commands he called his servants and sent them running then gratefully accepted neds offer of a chair and a cup of sweet beer ser barristan selmy was the first to answer the summons immaculate in white cloak and enameled scales my lords he said my place is beside the young king now pray give me leave to attend him your place is here ser barristan ned told him littlefinger came next still garbed in the blue velvets and silver mockingbird cape he had worn the night previous his boots dusty from riding my lords he said smiling at nothing in particular before he turned to ned that little task you set me is accomplished lord eddard varys entered in a wash of lavender pink from his bath his plump face scrubbed and freshly powdered his soft slippers all but soundless the little birds sing a grievous song today he said as he seated himself the realm weeps shall we begin when lord renly arrives ned said varys gave him a sorrowful look i fear lord renly has left the city left the city ned had counted on renlys support he took his leave through a postern gate an hour before dawn accompanied by ser loras tyrell and some fifty retainers varys told them when last seen they were galloping south in some haste no doubt bound for storms end or highgarden so much for renly and his hundred swords ned did not like the smell of that but there was nothing to be done for it he drew out roberts last letter the king called me to his side last night and commanded me to record his final words lord renly and grand maester pycelle stood witness as robert sealed the letter to be opened by the council after his death ser barristan if you would be so kind page the lord commander of the kingsguard examined the paper king roberts seal and unbroken he opened the letter and read lord eddard stark is herein named protector of the realm to rule as regent until the heir comes of age and as it happens he is of age ned reflected but he did not give voice to the thought he trusted neither pycelle nor varys and ser barristan was honorbound to protect and defend the boy he thought his new king the old knight would not abandon joffrey easily the need for deceit was a bitter taste in his mouth but ned knew he must tread softly here must keep his counsel and play the game until he was firmly established as regent there would be time enough to deal with the succession when arya and sansa were safely back in winterfell and lord stannis had returned to kings landing with all his power i would ask this council to confirm me as lord protector as robert wished ned said watching their faces wondering what thoughts hid behind pycelles halfclosed eyes littlefingers lazy halfsmile and the nervous flutter of varyss fingers the door opened fat tom stepped into the solar pardon my lords the kings steward insists the royal steward entered and bowed esteemed lords the king demands the immediate presence of his small council in the throne room ned had expected cersei to strike quickly the summons came as no surprise the king is dead he said but we shall go with you nonetheless tom assemble an escort if you would littlefinger gave ned his arm to help him down the steps varys pycelle and ser barristan followed close behind a double column of menatarms in chainmail and steel helms was waiting outside the tower eight strong grey cloaks snapped in the wind as the guardsmen marched them across the yard there was no lannister crimson to be seen but ned was reassured by the number of gold cloaks visible on the ramparts and at the gates janos slynt met them at the door to the throne room armored in ornate blackandgold plate with a highcrested helm under one arm the commander bowed stiffly his men pushed open the great oaken doors twenty feet tall and banded with bronze the royal steward led them in all hail his grace joffrey of the houses baratheon and lannister the first of his name king of the andals and the rhoynar and the first men lord of the seven kingdoms and protector of the realm he sang out it was a long walk to the far end of the hall where joffrey waited atop the iron throne supported by littlefinger ned stark slowly limped and hopped toward the boy who called himself king the others followed the first time he had come this way he had been on horseback sword in hand and the targaryen dragons had watched from the walls as he forced jaime lannister down from the throne he wondered if joffrey would step down quite so easily five knights of the kingsguardall but ser jaime and ser barristanwere arrayed in a crescent around the base of the throne they were in full armor enameled steel from helm to heel long pale cloaks over their shoulders shining white shields strapped to their left arms cersei lannister and her two younger page children stood behind ser boros and ser meryn the queen wore a gown of seagreen silk trimmed with myrish lace as pale as foam on her finger was a golden ring with an emerald the size of a pigeons egg on her head a matching tiara above them prince joffrey sat amidst the barbs and spikes in a clothofgold doublet and a red satin cape sandor clegane was stationed at the foot of the thrones steep narrow stair he wore mail and sootgrey plate and his snarling dogshead helm behind the throne twenty lannister guardsmen waited with longswords hanging from their belts crimson cloaks draped their shoulders and steel lions crested their helms but littlefinger had kept his promise all along the walls in front of roberts tapestries with their scenes of hunt and battle the goldcloaked ranks of the city watch stood stiffly to attention each mans hand clasped around the haft of an eightfootlong spear tipped in black iron they outnumbered the lannisters five to one neds leg was a blaze of pain by the time he stopped he kept a hand on littlefingers shoulder to help support his weight joffrey stood his red satin cape was patterned in gold thread fifty roaring lions to one side fifty prancing stags to the other i command the council to make all the necessary arrangements for my coronation the boy proclaimed i wish to be crowned within the fortnight today i shall accept oaths of fealty from my loyal councillors ned produced roberts letter lord varys be so kind as to show this to my lady of lannister the eunuch carried the letter to cersei the queen glanced at the words protector of the realm she read is this meant to be your shield my lord a piece of paper she ripped the letter in half ripped the halves in quarters and let the pieces flutter to the floor those were the kings words ser barristan said shocked we have a new king now cersei lannister replied lord eddard when last we spoke you gave me some counsel allow me to return the courtesy bend the knee my lord bend the knee and swear fealty to my son and we shall allow you to step down as hand and live out your days in the grey waste you call home would that i could ned said grimly if she was so determined to force the issue here and now she left him no choice your son has no claim to the throne he sits lord stannis is roberts true heir liar joffrey screamed his face reddening mother what does he mean princess myrcella asked the queen plaintively isnt joff the king now you condemn yourself with your own mouth lord stark said cersei lannister ser barristan seize this traitor the lord commander of the kingsguard hesitated in the blink of an eye he was surrounded by stark guardsmen bare steel in their mailed fists page and now the treason moves from words to deeds cersei said do you think ser barristan stands alone my lord with an ominous rasp of metal on metal the hound drew his longsword the knights of the kingsguard and twenty lannister guardsmen in crimson cloaks moved to support him kill him the boy king screamed down from the iron throne kill all of them i command it you leave me no choice ned told cersei lannister he called out to janos slynt commander take the queen and her children into custody do them no harm but escort them back to the royal apartments and keep them there under guard men of the watch janos slynt shouted donning his helm a hundred gold cloaks leveled their spears and closed i want no bloodshed ned told the queen tell your men to lay down their swords and no one need with a single sharp thrust the nearest gold cloak drove his spear into tomards back fat toms blade dropped from nerveless fingers as the wet red point burst out through his ribs piercing leather and mail he was dead before his sword hit the floor neds shout came far too late janos slynt himself slashed open varlys throat cayn whirled steel flashing drove back the nearest spearman with a flurry of blows for an instant it looked as though he might cut his way free then the hound was on him sandor cleganes first cut took off cayns sword hand at the wrist his second drove him to his knees and opened him from shoulder to breastbone as his men died around him littlefinger slid neds dagger from its sheath and shoved it up under his chin his smile was apologetic i did warn you not to trust me you know arya high syrio forel called out slashing at her head the stick swords clacked as arya parried left he shouted and his blade came whistling hers darted to meet it the clack made him click his teeth together right he said and low and left and left again faster and faster moving forward arya retreated before him checking each blow lunge he warned and when he thrust she sidestepped swept his blade away and slashed at his shoulder she almost touched him almost so close it made her grin a strand of hair dangled in her eyes limp with sweat she pushed it away with the back of her hand left syrio sang out low his sword was a blur and the small hall echoed to the clack clack clack left left high left right left low left the wooden blade caught her high in the breast a sudden stinging blow that hurt all the more because it came from the wrong side owl she cried out she would have a fresh bruise there by the time she went to sleep somewhere out at sea a bruise is a lesson she told herself and each lesson makes us page better syrio stepped back you are dead now arya made a face you cheated she said hotly you said left and you went right just so and now you are a dead girl but you lied my words lied my eyes and my arm shouted out the truth but you were not seeing i was so arya said i watched you every second watching is not seeing dead girl the water dancer sees come put down the sword it is time for listening now she followed him over to the wall where he settled onto a bench syrio forel was first sword to the sealord of braavos and are you knowing how that came to pass you were the finest swordsman in the city just so but why other men were stronger faster younger why was syrio forel the best i will tell you now he touched the tip of his little finger lightly to his eyelid the seeing the true seeing that is the heart of it hear me the ships of braavos sail as far as the winds blow to lands strange and wonderful and when they return their captains fetch queer animals to the sealords menagerie such animals as you have never seen striped horses great spotted things with necks as long as stilts hairy mousepigs as big as cows stinging manticores tigers that carry their cubs in a pouch terrible walking lizards with scythes for claws syrio forel has seen these things on the day i am speaking of the first sword was newly dead and the sealord sent for me many bravos had come to him and as many had been sent away none could say why when i came into his presence he was seated and in his lap was a fat yellow cat he told me that one of his captains had brought the beast to him from an island beyond the sunrise have you ever seen her liket he asked of me and to him i said each night in the alleys of braavos i see a thousand like him and the sealord laughed and that day i was named the first sword arya screwed up her face i dont understand syrio clicked his teeth together the cat was an ordinary cat no more the others expected a fabulous beast so that is what they saw how large it was they said it was no larger than any other cat only fat from indolence for the sealord fed it from his own table what curious small ears they said its ears had been chewed away in kitten fights and it was plainly a tomcat yet the sealord said her and that is what the others saw are you hearing page arya thought about it you saw what was there just so opening your eyes is all that is needing the heart lies and the head plays tricks with us but the eyes see true look with your eyes hear with your ears taste with your mouth smell with your nose feel with your skin then comes the thinking afterward and in that way knowing the truth just so said arya grinning syrio forel allowed himself a smile i am thinking that when we are reaching this winterfell of yours it will be time to put this needle in your hand yes arya said eagerly wait till i show jon behind her the great wooden doors of the small hall flew open with a resounding crash arya whirled a knight of the kingsguard stood beneath the arch of the door with five lannister guardsmen arrayed behind him he was in full armor but his visor was up arya remembered his droopy eyes and rustcolored whiskers from when he had come to winterfell with the king ser meryn trant the red cloaks wore mail shirts over boiled leather and steel caps with lion crests arya stark the knight said come with us child arya chewed her lip uncertainly what do you want your father wants to see you arya took a step forward but syrio forel held her by the arm and why is it that lord eddard is sending lannister men in the place of his own i am wondering mind your place dancing master ser meryn said this is no concern of yours my father wouldnt send you arya said she snatched up her stick sword the lannisters laughed put down the stick girl ser meryn told her i am a sworn brother of the kingsguard the white swords so was the kingslayer when he killed the old king arya said i dont have to go with you if i dont want ser meryn trant ran out of patience take her he said to his men he lowered the visor of his helm three of them started forward chainmail clinking softly with each step arya was suddenly afraid fear cuts deeper than swords she told herself to slow the racing of her heart syrio forel stepped between them tapping his wooden sword lightly against his boot you will be stopping there are you men or dogs that you would threaten a child out of the way old man one of the red cloaks said page syrios stick came whistling up and rang against his helm i am syrio forel and you will now be speaking to me with more respect bald bastard the man yanked free his longsword the stick moved again blindingly fast arya heard a loud crack as the sword went clattering to the stone floor my hand the guardsman yelped cradling his broken fingers you are quick for a dancing master said ser meryn you are slow for a knight syrio replied kill the braavosi and bring me the girl the knight in the white armor commanded four lannister guardsmen unsheathed their swords the fifth with the broken fingers spat and pulled free a dagger with his left hand syrio forel clicked his teeth together sliding into his water dancers stance presenting only his side to the foe arya child he called out never looking never taking his eyes off the lannisters we are done with dancing for the day best you are going now run to your father arya did not want to leave him but he had taught her to do as he said swift as a deer she whispered just so said syrio forel as the lannisters closed arya retreated her own sword stick clutched tightly in her hand watching him now she realized that syrio had only been toying with her when they dueled the red cloaks came at him from three sides with steel in their hands they had chainmail over their chest and arms and steel codpieces sewn into their pants but only leather on their legs their hands were bare and the caps they wore had noseguards but no visor over the eyes syrio did not wait for them to reach him but spun to his left arya had never seen a man move as fast he checked one sword with his stick and whirled away from a second off balance the second man lurched into the first syrio put a boot to his back and the red cloaks went down together the third guard came leaping over them slashing at the water dancers head syrio ducked under his blade and thrust upward the guardsman fell screaming as blood welled from the wet red hole where his left eye had been the fallen men were getting up syrio kicked one in the face and snatched the steel cap off the others head the dagger man stabbed at him syrio caught the thrust in the helmet and shattered the mans kneecap with his stick the last red cloak shouted a curse and charged hacking down with both hands on his sword syrio rolled right and the butchers cut caught the helmetless man between neck and shoulder as he struggled to his knees the longsword crunched through mail and leather and flesh the man on his knees shrieked before his killer could wrench free his blade syrio jabbed him in the apple of his throat the guardsman gave a choked cry and staggered back clutching at his neck his face blackening page five men were down dead or dying by the time arya reached the back door that opened on the kitchen she heard ser meryn trant curse bloody oafs he swore drawing his longsword from its scabbard syrio forel resumed his stance and clicked his teeth together arya child he called out never looking at her be gone now look with your eyes he had said she saw the knight in his pale armor head to foot legs throat and hands sheathed in metal eyes hidden behind his high white helm and in his hand cruel steel against that syrio in a leather vest with a wooden sword in his hand syrio run she screamed the first sword of braavos does not run he sang as ser meryn slashed at him syrio danced away from his cut his stick a blur in a heartbeat he had bounced blows off the knights temple elbow and throat the wood ringing against the metal of helm gauntlet and gorget arya stood frozen ser meryn advanced syrio backed away he checked the next blow spun away from the second deflected the third the fourth sliced his stick in two splintering the wood and shearing through the lead core sobbing arya spun and ran she plunged through the kitchens and buttery blind with panic weaving between cooks and potboys a bakers helper stepped in front of her holding a wooden tray arya bowled her over scattering fragrant loaves of freshbaked bread on the floor she heard shouting behind her as she spun around a portly butcher who stood gaping at her with a cleaver in his hands his arms were red to the elbow all that syrio forel had taught her went racing through her head swift as a deer quiet as a shadow fear cuts deeper than swords quick as a snake calm as still water fear cuts deeper than swords strong as a bear fierce as a wolverine fear cuts deeper than swords the man who fears losing has already lost fear cuts deeper than swords fear cuts deeper than swords fear cuts deeper than swords the grip of her wooden sword was slick with sweat and arya was breathing hard when she reached the turret stair for an instant she froze up or down up would take her to the covered bridge that spanned the small court to the tower of the hand but that would be the way theyd expect her to go for certain never do what they expect syrio once said arya went down around and around leaping over the narrow stone steps two and three at a time she emerged in a cavernous vaulted cellar surrounded by casks of ale stacked twenty feet tall the only light came through narrow slanting windows high in the wall the cellar was a dead end there was no way out but the way she had come in she dare not go back up those steps but she couldnt stay here either she had to find her father and tell him what had happened her father would protect her arya thrust her wooden sword through her belt and began to climb leaping from cask to cask until she could reach the window grasping the stone with both hands she pulled herself up the wall was three feet thick the window a tunnel slanting up and out arya wriggled toward daylight when her head reached ground level she peered across the bailey to the tower of the hand page the stout wooden door hung splintered and broken as if by axes a dead man sprawled facedown on the steps his cloak tangled beneath him the back of his mailed shirt soaked red the corpses cloak was grey wool trimmed with white satin she saw with sudden terror she could not tell who he was no she whispered what was happening where was her father why had the red cloaks come for her she remembered what the man with the yellow beard had said the day she had found the monsters if one hand can die why not a second arya felt tears in her eyes she held her breath to listen she heard the sounds of fighting shouts screams the clang of steel on steel coming through the windows of the tower of the hand she could not go back her father arya closed her eyes for a moment she was too frightened to move they had killed jory and wyl and heward and that guardsman on the step whoever he had been they could kill her father too and her if they caught her fear cuts deeper than swords she said aloud but it was no good pretending to be a water dancer syrio had been a water dancer and the white knight had probably killed him and anyhow she was only a little girl with a wooden stick alone and afraid she squirmed out into the yard glancing around warily as she climbed to her feet the castle seemed deserted the red keep was never deserted all the people must be hiding inside their doors barred arya glanced up longingly at her bedchamber then moved away from the tower of the hand keeping close to the wall as she slid from shadow to shadow she pretended she was chasing cats except she was the cat now and if they caught her they would kill her moving between buildings and over walls keeping stone to her back wherever possible so no one could surprise her arya reached the stables almost without incident a dozen gold cloaks in mail and plate ran past as she was edging across the inner bailey but without knowing whose side they were on she hunched down low in the shadows and let them pass hullen who had been master of horse at winterfell as long as arya could remember was slumped on the ground by the stable door he had been stabbed so many times it looked as if his tunic was patterned with scarlet flowers arya was certain he was dead but when she crept closer his eyes opened arya underfoot he whispered you must warn your your lord father frothy red spittle bubbled from his mouth the master of horse closed his eyes again and said no more inside were more bodies a groom she had played with and three of her fathers household guard a wagon laden with crates and chests stood abandoned near the door of the stable the dead men must have been loading it for the trip to the docks when they were attacked arya snuck closer one of the corpses was desmond whod shown her his longsword and promised to protect her father he lay on his back staring blindly at the ceiling as flies crawled across his eyes close to him was a dead man in the red cloak and lioncrest helm of the lannisters only one though every northerner is worth ten of these southron swords desmond had told her you liar she said kicking his body in a sudden fury the animals were restless in their stalls whickering and snorting at the scent of blood aryas only plan was to saddle a horse and flee away from the castle and the city all she had to do was stay on the kingsroad and it would take her back to winterfell she took a bridle and harness off the wall as she crossed in back of the wagon a fallen chest caught her eye it must have been knocked down in page the fight or dropped as it was being loaded the wood had split the lid opening to spill the chests contents across the ground arya recognized silks and satins and velvets she never wore she might need warm clothes on the kingsroad though and besides arya knelt in the dirt among the scattered clothes she found a heavy woolen cloak a velvet skirt and a silk tunic and some smallclothes a dress her mother had embroidered for her a silver baby bracelet she might sell shoving the broken lid out of the way she groped inside the chest for needle she had hidden it way down at the bottom under everything but her stuff had all been jumbled around when the chest was dropped for a moment arya was afraid someone had found the sword and stolen it then her fingers felt the hardness of metal under a satin gown there she is a voice hissed close behind her startled arya whirled a stableboy stood behind her a smirk on his face his filthy white undertunic peeking out from beneath a soiled jerkin his boots were covered with manure and he had a pitchfork in one hand who are you she asked she dont know me he said but i knows her oh yes the wolf girl help me saddle a horse arya pleaded reaching back into the chest groping for needle my fathers the hand of the king hell reward you fathers dead the boy said he shuffled toward her its the queen wholl be rewarding me come here girl stay away her fingers closed around needles hilt i says come he grabbed her arm hard everything syrio forel had ever taught her vanished in a heartbeat in that instant of sudden terror the only lesson arya could remember was the one jon snow had given her the very first she stuck him with the pointy end driving the blade upward with a wild hysterical strength needle went through his leather jerkin and the white flesh of his belly and came out between his shoulder blades the boy dropped the pitchfork and made a soft noise something between a gasp and a sigh his hands closed around the blade oh gods he moaned as his undertunic began to redden take it out when she took it out he died the horses were screaming arya stood over the body still and frightened in the face of death blood had gushed from the boys mouth as he collapsed and more was seeping from the slit in his belly pooling beneath his body his palms were cut where hed grabbed at the blade she backed away slowly needle red in her hand she had to get away someplace far from here someplace safe away from the stableboys accusing eyes she snatched up the bridle and harness again and ran to her mare but as she lifted the saddle to the page horses back arya realized with a sudden sick dread that the castle gates would be closed even the postern doors would likely be guarded maybe the guards wouldnt recognize her if they thought she was a boy perhaps theyd let her no theyd have orders not to let anyone out it wouldnt matter whether they knew her or not but there was another way out of the castle the saddle slipped from aryas fingers and fell to the dirt with a thump and a puff of dust could she find the room with the monsters again she wasnt certain yet she knew she had to try she found the clothing shed gathered and slipped into the cloak concealing needle beneath its folds the rest of her things she tied in a roll with the bundle under her arm she crept to the far end of the stable unlatching the back door she peeked out anxiously she could hear the distant sound of swordplay and the shivery wail of a man screaming in pain across the bailey she would need to go down the serpentine steps past the small kitchen and the pig yard that was how shed gone last time chasing the black tomcat only that would take her right past the barracks of the gold cloaks she couldnt go that way arya tried to think of another way if she crossed to the other side of the castle she could creep along the river wall and through the little godswood but first shed have to cross the yard in the plain view of the guards on the walls she had never seen so many men on the walls gold cloaks most of them armed with spears some of them knew her by sight what would they do if they saw her running across the yard shed look so small from up there would they be able to tell who she was would they care she had to leave now she told herself but when the moment came she was too frightened to move calm as still water a small voice whispered in her ear arya was so startled she almost dropped her bundle she looked around wildly but there was no one in the stable but her and the horses and the dead men quiet as a shadow she heard was it her own voice or syrios she could not tell yet somehow it calmed her fears she stepped out of the stable it was the scariest thing shed ever done she wanted to run and hide but she made herself walk across the yard slowly putting one foot in front of the other as if she had all the time in the world and no reason to be afraid of anyone she thought she could feel their eyes like bugs crawling on her skin under her clothes arya never looked up if she saw them watching all her courage would desert her she knew and she would drop the bundle of clothes and run and cry like a baby and then they would have her she kept her gaze on the ground by the time she reached the shadow of the royal sept on the far side of the yard arya was cold with sweat but no one had raised the hue and cry the sept was open and empty inside half a hundred prayer candles burned in a fragrant silence arya figured the gods would never miss two she stuffed them up her sleeves and left by a back window sneaking back to the alley where she had cornered the oneeared tom was easy but after that she got lost she crawled in and out of windows hopped over walls and felt her way through dark cellars quiet page as a shadow once she heard a woman weeping it took her more than an hour to find the low narrow window that slanted down to the dungeon where the monsters waited she tossed her bundle through and doubled back to light her candle that was chancy the fire shed remembered seeing had burnt down to embers and she heard voices as she was blowing on the coals cupping her fingers around the flickering candle she went out the window as they were coming in the door without ever getting a glimpse of who it was this time the monsters did not frighten her they seemed almost old friends arya held the candle over her head with each step she took the shadows moved against the walls as if they were turning to watch her pass dragons she whispered she slid needle out from under her cloak the slender blade seemed very small and the dragons very big yet somehow arya felt better with steel in her hand the long windowless hall beyond the door was as black as she remembered she held needle in her left hand her sword hand the candle in her right fist hot wax ran down across her knuckles the entrance to the well had been to the left so arya went right part of her wanted to run but she was afraid of snuffing out her candle she heard the faint squeaking of rats and glimpsed a pair of tiny glowing eyes on the edge of the light but rats did not scare her other things did it would be so easy to hide here as she had hidden from the wizard and the man with the forked beard she could almost see the stableboy standing against the wall his hands curled into claws with the blood still dripping from the deep gashes in his palms where needle had cut him he might be waiting to grab her as she passed he would see her candle coming a long way off maybe she would be better off without the light fear cuts deeper than swords the quiet voice inside her whispered suddenly arya remembered the crypts at winterfell they were a lot scarier than this place she told herself shed been just a little girl the first time she saw them her brother robb had taken them down her and sansa and baby bran whod been no bigger than rickon was now theyd only had one candle between them and brans eyes had gotten as big as saucers as he stared at the stone faces of the kings of winter with their wolves at their feet and their iron swords across their laps robb took them all the way down to the end past grandfather and brandon and lyanna to show them their own tombs sansa kept looking at the stubby little candle anxious that it might go out old nan had told her there were spiders down here and rats as big as dogs robb smiled when she said that there are worse things than spiders and rats he whispered this is where the dead walk that was when they heard the sound low and deep and shivery baby bran had clutched at aryas hand when the spirit stepped out of the open tomb pale white and moaning for blood sansa ran shrieking for the stairs and bran wrapped himself around robbs leg sobbing arya stood her ground and gave the spirit a punch it was only jon covered with flour you stupid she told him you scared the baby but jon and robb just laughed and laughed and pretty soon bran and arya were laughing too the memory made arya smile and after that the darkness held no more terrors for her the stableboy was dead shed killed him and if he jumped out at her shed kill him again she was going home everything would be better once she was home again safe behind winterfells grey granite walls page her footsteps sent soft echoes hurrying ahead of her as arya plunged deeper into the darkness sansa they came for sansa on the third day she chose a simple dress of dark grey wool plainly cut but richly embroidered around the collar and sleeves her fingers felt thick and clumsy as she struggled with the silver fastenings without the benefit of servants jeyne poole had been confined with her but jeyne was useless her face was puffy from all her crying and she could not seem to stop sobbing about her father im certain your father is well sansa told her when she had finally gotten the dress buttoned right ill ask the queen to let you see him she thought that kindness might lift jeynes spirits but the other girl just looked at her with red swollen eyes and began to cry all the harder she was such a child sansa had wept too the first day even within the stout walls of maegors holdfast with her door closed and barred it was hard not to be terrified when the killing began she had grown up to the sound of steel in the yard and scarcely a day of her life had passed without hearing the clash of sword on sword yet somehow knowing that the fighting was real made all the difference in the world she heard it as she had never heard it before and there were other sounds as well grunts of pain angry curses shouts for help and the moans of wounded and dying men in the songs the knights never screamed nor begged for mercy so she wept pleading through her door for them to tell her what was happening calling for her father for septa mordane for the king for her gallant prince if the men guarding her heard her pleas they gave no answer the only time the door opened was late that night when they thrust jeyne poole inside bruised and shaking theyre killing everyone the stewards daughter had shrieked at her she went on and on the hound had broken down her door with a warhammer she said there were bodies on the stair of the tower of the hand and the steps were slick with blood sansa dried her own tears as she struggled to comfort her friend they went to sleep in the same bed cradled in each others arms like sisters the second day was even worse the room where sansa had been confined was at the top of the highest tower of maegors holdfast from its window she could see that the heavy iron portcullis in the gatehouse was down and the drawbridge drawn up over the deep dry moat that separated the keepwithinakeep from the larger castle that surrounded it lannister guardsmen prowled the walls with spears and crossbows to hand the fighting was over and the silence of the grave had settled over the red keep the only sounds were jeyne pooles endless whimpers and sobs they were fedhard cheese and freshbaked bread and milk to break their fast roast chicken and greens at midday and a late supper of beef and barley stewbut the servants who brought the meals would not answer sansas questions that evening some women brought her clothes from the tower of the hand and some of jeynes things as well but they seemed nearly as frightened as jeyne and when she tried to talk to them they fled from her as if she had the grey plague the guards outside the door still refused to let them leave the room page please i need to speak to the queen again sansa told them as she told everyone she saw that day shell want to talk to me i know she will tell her i want to see her please if not the queen then prince joffrey if youd be so kind were to marry when were older at sunset on the second day a great bell began to ring its voice was deep and sonorous and the long slow clanging filled sansa with a sense of dread the ringing went on and on and after a while they heard other bells answering from the great sept of baelor on visenyas hill the sound rumbled across the city like thunder warning of the storm to come what is it jeyne asked covering her ears why are they ringing the bells the king is dead sansa could not say how she knew it yet she did the slow endless clanging filled their room as mournful as a dirge had some enemy stormed the castle and murdered king robert was that the meaning of the fighting they had heard she went to sleep wondering restless and fearful was her beautiful joffrey the king now or had they killed him too she was afraid for him and for her father if only they would tell her what was happening that night sansa dreamt of joffrey on the throne with herself seated beside him in a gown of woven gold she had a crown on her head and everyone she had ever known came before her to bend the knee and say their courtesies the next morning the morning of the third day ser boros blount of the kingsguard came to escort her to the queen ser boros was an ugly man with a broad chest and short bandy legs his nose was flat his cheeks baggy with jowls his hair grey and brittle today he wore white velvet and his snowy cloak was fastened with a lion brooch the beast had the soft sheen of gold and his eyes were tiny rubies you look very handsome and splendid this morning ser boros sansa told him a lady remembered her courtesies and she was resolved to be a lady no matter what and you my lady ser boros said in a flat voice her grace awaits come with me there were guards outside her door lannister menatarms in crimson cloaks and lioncrested helms sansa made herself smile at them pleasantly and bid them a good morning as she passed it was the first time she had been allowed outside the chamber since ser arys oakheart had led her there two mornings past to keep you safe my sweet one queen cersei had told her joffrey would never forgive me if anything happened to his precious sansa had expected that ser boros would escort her to the royal apartments but instead he led her out of maegors holdfast the bridge was down again some workmen were lowering a man on ropes into the depths of the dry moat when sansa peered down she saw a body impaled on the huge iron spikes below she averted her eyes quickly afraid to ask afraid to look too long afraid he might be someone she knew they found queen cersei in the council chambers seated at the head of a long table littered with papers candles and blocks of sealing wax the room was as splendid as any that sansa had ever seen page she stared in awe at the carved wooden screen and the twin sphinxes that sat beside the door your grace ser boros said when they were ushered inside by another of the kingsguard ser mandon of the curiously dead face ive brought the girl sansa had hoped joffrey might be with her her prince was not there but three of the kings councillors were lord petyr baelish sat on the queens left hand grand maester pycelle at the end of the table while lord varys hovered over them smelling flowery all of them were clad in black she realized with a feeling of dread mourning clothes the queen wore a highcollared black silk gown with a hundred dark red rubies sewn into her bodice covering her from neck to bosom they were cut in the shape of teardrops as if the queen were weeping blood cersei smiled to see her and sansa thought it was the sweetest and saddest smile she had ever seen sansa my sweet child she said i know youve been asking for me im sorry that i could not send for you sooner matters have been very unsettled and i have not had a moment i trust my people have been taking good care of you everyone has been very sweet and pleasant your grace thank you ever so much for asking sansa said politely only well no one will talk to us or tell us whats happened us cersei seemed puzzled we put the stewards girl in with her ser boros said we did not know what else to do with her the queen frowned next time you will ask she said her voice sharp the gods only know what sort of tales shes been filling sansas head with jeynes scared sansa said she wont stop crying i promised her id ask if she could see her father old grand maester pycelle lowered his eyes her father is well isnt he sansa said anxiously she knew there had been fighting but surely no one would harm a steward vayon poole did not even wear a sword queen cersei looked at each of the councillors in turn i wont have sansa fretting needlessly what shall we do with this little friend of hers my lords lord petyr leaned forward ill find a place for her not in the city said the queen do you take me for a fool the queen ignored that ser boros escort this girl to lord petyrs apartments and instruct his people to keep her there until he comes for her tell her that littlefinger will be taking her to see her father that ought to calm her down i want her gone before sansa returns to her chamber page as you command your grace ser boros said he bowed deeply spun on his heel and took his leave his long white cloak stirring the air behind him sansa was confused i dont understand she said where is jeynes father why cant ser boros take her to him instead of lord petyr having to do it she had promised herself she would be a lady gentle as the queen and as strong as her mother the lady catelyn but all of a sudden she was scared again for a second she thought she might cry where are you sending her she hasnt done anything wrong shes a good girl shes upset you the queen said gently we cant be having that not another word now lord baelish will see that jeynes well taken care of i promise you she patted the chair beside her sit down sansa i want to talk to you sansa seated herself beside the queen cersei smiled again but that did not make her feel any less anxious varys was wringing his soft hands together grand maester pycelle kept his sleepy eyes on the papers in front of him but she could feel littlefinger staring something about the way the small man looked at her made sansa feel as though she had no clothes on goose bumps pimpled her skin sweet sansa queen cersei said laying a soft hand on her wrist such a beautiful child i do hope you know how much joffrey and i love you you do sansa said breathless littlefinger was forgotten her prince loved her nothing else mattered the queen smiled i think of you almost as my own daughter and i know the love you bear for joffrey she gave a weary shake of her head i am afraid we have some grave news about your lord father you must be brave child her quiet words gave sansa a chill what is it your father is a traitor dear lord varys said grand maester pycelle lifted his ancient head with my own ears i heard lord eddard swear to our beloved king robert that he would protect the young princes as if they were his own sons and yet the moment the king was dead he called the small council together to steal prince joffreys rightful throne no sansa blurted he wouldnt do that he wouldnt the queen picked up a letter the paper was torn and stiff with dried blood but the broken seal was her fathers the direwolf stamped in pale wax we found this on the captain of your household guard sansa it is a letter to my late husbands brother stannis inviting him to take the crown please your grace theres been a mistake sudden panic made her dizzy and faint please send for my father hell tell you he would never write such a letter the king was his friend robert thought so said the queen this betrayal would have broken his heart the gods are kind that he did not live to see it she sighed sansa sweetling you must see what a dreadful position this has left us in you are innocent of any wrong we all know that and yet you are the daughter of a traitor how page can i allow you to marry my son but i love him sansa wailed confused and frightened what did they mean to do to her what had they done to her father it was not supposed to happen this way she had to wed joffrey they were betrothed he was promised to her she had even dreamed about it it wasnt fair to take him away from her on account of whatever her father might have done how well i know that child cersei said her voice so kind and sweet why else should you have come to me and told me of your fathers plan to send you away from us if not for love it was for love sansa said in a rush father wouldnt even give me leave to say farewell she was the good girl the obedient girl but she had felt as wicked as arya that morning sneaking away from septa mordane defying her lord father she had never done anything so willful before and she would never have done it then if she hadnt loved joffrey as much as she did he was going to take me back to winterfell and marry me to some hedge knight even though it was joff i wanted i told him but he wouldnt listen the king had been her last hope the king could command father to let her stay in kings landing and marry prince joffrey sansa knew he could but the king had always frightened her he was loud and roughvoiced and drunk as often as not and he would probably have just sent her back to lord eddard if they even let her see him so she went to the queen instead and poured out her heart and cersei had listened and thanked her sweetly only then ser arys had escorted her to the high room in maegors holdfast and posted guards and a few hours later the fighting had begun outside please she finished you have to let me marry joffrey ill be ever so good a wife to him youll see ill be a queen just like you i promise queen cersei looked to the others my lords of the council what do you say to her plea the poor child murmured varys a love so true and innocent your grace it would be cruel to deny it and yet what can we do her father stands condemned his soft hands washed each other in a gesture of helpless distress a child born of traitors seed will find that betrayal comes naturally to her said grand maester pycelle she is a sweet thing now but in ten years who can say what treasons she may hatch no sansa said horrified im not id never i wouldnt betray joffrey i love him i swear it i do oh so poignant said varys and yet it is truly said that blood runs truer than oaths she reminds me of the mother not the father lord petyr baelish said quietly look at her the hair the eyes she is the very image of cat at the same age the queen looked at her troubled and yet sansa could see kindness in her clear green eyes child she said if i could truly believe that you were not like your father why nothing should please me more than to see you wed to my joffrey i know he loves you with all his heart she sighed and yet i fear that lord varys and the grand maester have the right of it the blood will tell i have only to remember how your sister set her wolf on my son im not like arya sansa blurted she has the traitors blood not me im good ask septa mordane page shell tell you i only want to be joffreys loyal and loving wife she felt the weight of cerseis eyes as the queen studied her face i believe you mean it child she turned to face the others my lords it seems to me that if the rest of her kin were to remain loyal in this terrible time that would go a long way toward laying our fears to rest grand maester pycelle stroked his huge soft beard his wide brow furrowed in thought lord eddard has three sons mere boys lord petyr said with a shrug i should be more concerned with lady catelyn and the tullys the queen took sansas hand in both of hers child do you know your letters sansa nodded nervously she could read and write better than any of her brothers although she was hopeless at sums i am pleased to hear that perhaps there is hope for you and joffrey still what do you want me to do you must write your lady mother and your brother the eldest what is his name robb sansa said the word of your lord fathers treason will no doubt reach them soon better that it should come from you you must tell them how lord eddard betrayed his king sansa wanted joffrey desperately but she did not think she had the courage to do as the queen was asking but he never i dont your grace i wouldnt know what to say the queen patted her hand we will tell you what to write child the important thing is that you urge lady catelyn and your brother to keep the kings peace it will go hard for them if they dont said grand maester pycelle by the love you bear them you must urge them to walk the path of wisdom your lady mother will no doubt fear for you dreadfully the queen said you must tell her that you are well and in our care that we are treating you gently and seeing to your every want bid them to come to kings landing and pledge their fealty to joffrey when he takes his throne if they do that why then we shall know that there is no taint in your blood and when you come into the flower of your womanhood you shall wed the king in the great sept of baelor before the eyes of gods and men wed the king the words made her breath come faster yet still sansa hesitated perhaps if i might see my father talk to him about treason lord varys hinted page you disappoint me sansa the queen said with eyes gone hard as stones weve told you of your fathers crimes if you are truly as loyal as you say why should you want to see him i i only meant sansa felt her eyes grow wet hes not please he hasnt been hurt or or lord eddard has not been harmed the queen said but whats to become of him that is a matter for the king to decide grand maester pycelle announced ponderously the king sansa blinked back her tears joffrey was the king now she thought her gallant prince would never hurt her father no matter what he might have done if she went to him and pleaded for mercy she was certain hed listen he had to listen he loved her even the queen said so joff would need to punish father the lords would expect it but perhaps he could send him back to winterfell or exile him to one of the free cities across the narrow sea it would only have to be for a few years by then she and joffrey would be married once she was queen she could persuade joff to bring father back and grant him a pardon only if mother or robb did anything treasonous called the banners or refused to swear fealty or anything it would all go wrong her joffrey was good and kind she knew it in her heart but a king had to be stern with rebels she had to make them understand she had to ill ill write the letters sansa told them with a smile as warm as the sunrise cersei lannister leaned close and kissed her gently on the cheek i knew you would joffrey will be so proud when i tell him what courage and good sense youve shown here today in the end she wrote four letters to her mother the lady catelyn stark and to her brothers at winterfell and to her aunt and her grandfather as well lady lysa arryn of the eyrie and lord hoster tully of riverrun by the time she had done her fingers were cramped and stiff and stained with ink varys had her fathers seal she warmed the pale white beeswax over a candle poured it carefully and watched as the eunuch stamped each letter with the direwolf of house stark jeyne poole and all her things were gone when ser mandon moore returned sansa to the high tower of maegors holdfast no more weeping she thought gratefully yet somehow it seemed colder with jeyne gone even after shed built a fire she pulled a chair close to the hearth took down one of her favorite books and lost herself in the stories of florian and jonquil of lady shella and the rainbow knight of valiant prince aemon and his doomed love for his brothers queen it was not until later that night as she was drifting off to sleep that sansa realized she had forgotten to ask about her sister jon othor announced ser jaremy rykker beyond a doubt and this one was jafer flowers he turned page the corpse over with his foot and the dead white face stared up at the overcast sky with blue blue eyes they were ben starks men both of them my uncles men jon thought numbly he remembered how hed pleaded to ride with them gods i was such a green boy if he had taken me it might be me lying here jafers right wrist ended in the ruin of torn flesh and splintered bone left by ghostsjaws his right hand was floating in ajar of vinegar back in maester aemons tower his left hand still at the end of his arm was as black as his cloak gods have mercy the old bear muttered he swung down from his garron handing his reins to jon the morning was unnaturally warm beads of sweat dotted the lord commanders broad forehead like dew on a melon his horse was nervous rolling her eyes backing away from the dead men as far as her lead would allow jon led her off a few paces fighting to keep her from bolting the horses did not like the feel of this place for that matter neither did jon the dogs liked it least of all ghost had led the party here the pack of hounds had been useless when bass the kennelmaster had tried to get them to take the scent from the severed hand they had gone wild yowling and barking fighting to get away even now they were snarling and whimpering by turns pulling at their leashes while chett cursed them for curs it is only a wood jon told himself and theyre only dead men he had seen dead men before last night he had dreamt the winterfell dream again he was wandering the empty castle searching for his father descending into the crypts only this time the dream had gone further than before in the dark hed heard the scrape of stone on stone when he turned he saw that the vaults were opening one after the other as the dead kings came stumbling from their cold black graves jon had woken in pitchdark his heart hammering even when ghost leapt up on the bed to nuzzle at his face he could not shake his deep sense of terror he dared not go back to sleep instead he had climbed the wall and walked restless until he saw the light of the dawn off to the cast it was only a dream i am a brother of the nights watch now not a ffightened boy samwell tarly huddled beneath the trees halfhidden behind the horses his round fat face was the color of curdled milk so far he had not lurched off to the woods to retch but he had not so much as glanced at the dead men either i cant look he whispered miserably you have to look jon told him keeping his voice low so the others would not hear maester aemon sent you to be his eyes didnt he what good are eyes if theyre shut yes but im such a coward jon jon put a hand on sams shoulder we have a dozen rangers with us and the dogs even ghost no one will hurt you sam go ahead and look the first look is the hardest sam gave a tremulous nod working up his courage with a visible effort slowly he swiveled his head his eyes widened but jon held his arm so he could not turn away ser jaremy the old bear asked gruffly ben stark had six men with him when he rode from the wall page where are the others ser jaremy shook his head would that i knew plainly mormont was not pleased with that answer two of our brothers butchered almost within sight of the wall yet your rangers heard nothing saw nothing is this what the nights watch has fallen to do we still sweep these woods yes my lord but do we still mount watches we do but this man wears a hunting horn mormont pointed at othor must i suppose that he died without sounding it or have your rangers all gone deaf as well as blind ser jaremy bristled his face taut with anger no horn was blown my lord or my rangers would have heard it i do not have sufficient men to mount as many patrols as i should like and since benjen was lost we have stayed closer to the wall than we were wont to do before by your own command the old bear grunted yes well be that as it may he made an impatient gesture tell me how they died squatting beside the dead man he had named jafer flowers ser jaremy grasped his head by the scalp the hair came out between his fingers brittle as straw the knight cursed and shoved at the face with the heel of his hand a great gash in the side of the corpses neck opened like a mouth crusted with dried blood only a few ropes of pale tendon still attached the head to the neck this was done with an axe aye muttered dywen the old forester belike the axe that othor carried mlord jon could feel his breakfast churning in his belly but he pressed his lips together and made himself look at the second body othor had been a big ugly man and he made a big ugly corpse no axe was in evidence jon remembered othor he had been the one bellowing the bawdy song as the rangers rode out his singing days were done his flesh was blanched white as milk everywhere but his hands his hands were black like jafers blossoms of hard cracked blood decorated the mortal wounds that covered him like a rash breast and groin and throat yet his eyes were still open they stared up at the sky blue as sapphires ser jaremy stood the wildlings have axes too mormont rounded on him so you believe this is mance rayders work this close to the wall who else my lord jon could have told him he knew they all knew yet no man of them would say the words the others are only a story a tale to make children shiver if they ever lived at all they are gone eight thousand years even the thought made him feel foolish he was a man grown now a black brother of the nights watch not the boy whod once sat at old nans feet with bran and robb and arya page yet lord commander mormont gave a snort if ben stark had come under wildling attack a half days ride from castle black he would have returned for more men chased the killers through all seven hells and brought me back their heads unless he was slain as well ser jaremy insisted the words hurt even now it had been so long it seemed folly to cling to the hope that ben stark was still alive but jon snow was nothing if not stubborn it has been close on half a year since benjen left us my lord ser jaremy went on the forest is vast the wildlings might have fallen on him anywhere id wager these two were the last survivors of his party on their way back to us but the enemy caught them before they could reach the safety of the wall the corpses are still fresh these men cannot have been dead more than a day no samwell tarly squeaked jon was startled sams nervous highpitched voice was the last he would have expected to hear the fat boy was frightened of the officers and ser jaremy was not known for his patience i did not ask for your views boy rykker said coldly let him speak ser jon blurted mormonts eyes flicked from sam to jon and back again if the lad has something to say ill hear him out come closer boy we cant see you behind those horses sam edged past jon and the garrons sweating profusely my lord it it cant be a day or look the blood yes mormont growled impatiently blood what of it he soils his smallclothes at the sight of it chett shouted out and the rangers laughed sam mopped at the sweat on his brow you you can see where ghost jons direwolf you can see where he tore off that mans hand and yet the stump hasnt bled look he waved a hand my father llord randyll he he made me watch him dress animals sometimes when after sam shook his head from side to side his chins quivering now that he had looked at the bodies he could not seem to look away a fresh kill the blood would still flow my lords later later it would be clotted like a a jelly thick and and he looked as though he was going to be sick this man look at the wrist its all crusty dry like jon saw at once what sam meant he could see the torn veins in the dead mans wrist iron worms in the pale flesh his blood was a black dust yet jaremy rykker was unconvinced if theyd been dead much longer than a day theyd be ripe by now boy they dont even smell dywen the gnarled old forester who liked to boast that he could page smell snow coming on sidled closer to the corpses and took a whiff well theyre no pansy flowers but mlord has the truth of it theres no corpse stink they they arent rotting sam pointed his fat finger shaking only a little look theres theres no maggots or or worms or anything theyve been lying here in the woods but they they havent been chewed or eaten by animals only ghost otherwise theyre theyre untouched jon said softly and ghost is different the dogs and the horses wont go near them the rangers exchanged glances they could see it was true every man of them mormont frowned glancing from the corpses to the dogs chett bring the hounds closer chett tried cursing yanking on the leashes giving one animal a lick of his boot most of the dogs just whimpered and planted their feet he tried dragging one the bitch resisted growling and squirming as if to escape her collar finally she lunged at him chett dropped the leash and stumbled backward the dog leapt over him and bounded off into the trees this this is all wrong sam tarly said earnestly the blood theres bloodstains on their clothes and and their flesh dry and hard but theres none on the ground or anywhere with those those those sam made himself swallow took a deep breath with those wounds terrible wounds there should be blood all over shouldnt there dywen sucked at his wooden teeth might be they didnt die here might be someone brought ern and left ern for us a warning as like the old forester peered down suspiciously and might be im a fool but i dont know that othor never had no blue eyes afore ser jaremy looked startled neither did flowers he blurted turning to stare at the dead man a silence fell over the wood for a moment all they heard was sams heavy breathing and the wet sound of dywen sucking on his teeth jon squatted beside ghost bum them someone whispered one of the rangers jon could not have said who yes burn them a second voice urged the old bear gave a stubborn shake of his head not yet i want maester aemon to have a look at them well bring them back to the wall some commands are more easily given than obeyed they wrapped the dead men in cloaks but when hake and dywen tried to tie one onto a horse the animal went mad screaming and rearing lashing out with its hooves even biting at ketter when he ran to help the rangers had no better luck with the other garrons not even the most placid wanted any part of these burdens in the end they were forced to hack off branches and fashion crude slings to carry the corpses back on foot it was well past midday by the time they started back i will have these woods searched mormont commanded ser jaremy as they set out every tree page every rock every bush and every foot of muddy ground within ten leagues of here use all the men you have and if you do not have enough borrow hunters and foresters from the stewards if ben and the others are out here dead or alive i will have them found and if there is anyone else in these woods i will know of it you are to track them and take them alive if possible is that understood it is my lord ser jaremy said it will be done after that mormont rode in silence brooding jon followed close behind him as the lord commanders steward that was his place the day was grey damp overcast the sort of day that made you wish for rain no wind stirred the wood the air hung humid and heavy and jons clothes clung to his skin it was warm too warm the wall was weeping copiously had been weeping for days and sometimes jon even imagined it was shrinking the old men called this weather spirit summer and said it meant the season was giving up its ghosts at last after this the cold would come they warned and a long summer always meant a long winter this summer had lasted ten years jon had been a babe in arms when it began ghost ran with them for a time and then vanished among the trees without the direwolf jon felt almost naked he found himself glancing at every shadow with unease unbidden he thought back on the tales that old nan used to tell them when he was a boy at winterfell he could almost hear her voice again and the clickclickclick of her needles in that darkness the others came riding she used to say dropping her voice lower and lower cold and dead they were and they hated iron and fire and the touch of the sun and every living creature with hot blood in its veins holdfasts and cities and kingdoms of men allfell before them as they moved south on pale dead horses leading hosts of the slain they fed their dead servants on the flesh of human children when he caught his first glimpse of the wall looming above the tops of an ancient gnarled oak jon was vastly relieved mormont reined up suddenly and turned in his saddle tarly he barked come here jon saw the start of fright on sams face as he lumbered up on his mare doubtless he thought he was in trouble youre fat but youre not stupid boy the old bear said gruffly you did well back there and you snow sam blushed a vivid crimson and tripped over his own tongue as he tried to stammer out a courtesy jon had to smile when they emerged from under the trees mormont spurred his tough little garron to a trot ghost came streaking out from the woods to meet them licking his chops his muzzle red from prey high above the men on the wall saw the column approaching jon heard the deep throaty call of the watchmans great horn calling out across the miles a single long blast that shuddered through the trees and echoed off the ice uuuuuuuooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo the sound faded slowly to silence one blast meant rangers returning and jon thought i was a rangerfor one day at least whatever may come they cannot take that away from me bowen marsh was waiting at the first gate as they led their garrons through the icy tunnel the lord page steward was redfaced and agitated my lord he blurted at mormont as he swung open the iron bars theres been a bird you must come at once what is it man mormont said gruffly curiously marsh glanced at jon before he answered maester aemon has the letter hes waiting in your solar very well jon see to my horse and tell ser jaremy to put the dead men in a storeroom until the maester is ready for them mormont strode away grumbling as they led their horses back to the stable jon was uncomfortably aware that people were watching him ser alliser thorne was drilling his boys in the yard but he broke off to stare at jon a faint half smile on his lips onearmed donal noye stood in the door of the armory the gods be with you snow he called out somethings wrong jon thought somethings very wrong the dead men were carried to one of the storerooms along the base of the wall a dark cold cell chiseled from the ice and used to keep meat and grain and sometimes even beer jon saw that mormonts horse was fed and watered and groomed before he took care of his own afterward he sought out his friends grenn and toad were on watch but he found pyp in the common hall whats happened he asked pyp lowered his voice the kings dead jon was stunned robert baratheon had looked old and fat when he visited winterfell yet hed seemed hale enough and thered been no talk of illness how can you know one of the guards overheard clydas reading the letter to maester aemon pyp leaned close jon im sorry he was your fathers friend wasnt he they were as close as brothers once jon wondered if joffrey would keep his father as the kings hand it did not seem likely that might mean lord eddard would return to winterfell and his sisters as well he might even be allowed to visit them with lord mormonts permission it would be good to see aryas grin again and to talk with his father i will ask him about my mother he resolved i am a man now it is past time he told me even if she was a whore i dont care i want to know i heard hake say the dead men were your uncles pyp said yes jon replied two of the six he took with him theyd been dead a long time only the bodies are queer queer pyp was all curiosity how queer sam will tell you jon did not want to talk of it i should see if the old bear has need of me he walked to the lord commanders tower alone with a curious sense of apprehension the brothers on guard eyed him solemnly as he approached the old bears in his solar one of them announced page he was asking for you jon nodded he should have come straight from the stable he climbed the tower steps briskly he wants wine or a fire in his hearth thats all he told himself when he entered the solar mormonts raven screamed at him corn the bird shrieked corn corn corn dont you believe it i just fed him the old bear growled he was seated by the window reading a letter bring me a cup of wine and pour one for yourself for myself my lord mormont lifted his eyes from the letter to stare at jon there was pity in that look he could taste it you heard me jon poured with exaggerated care vaguely aware that he was drawing out the act when the cups were filled he would have no choice but to face whatever was in that letter yet all too soon they were filled sit boy mormont commanded him drink jon remained standing its my father isnt it the old bear tapped the letter with a finger your father and the king he rumbled i wont lie to you its grievous news i never thought to see another king not at my age with robert half my years and strong as a bull he took a gulp of wine they say the king loved to hunt the things we love destroy us every time lad remember that my son loved that young wife of his vain woman if not for her he would never have thought to sell those poachers jon could scarcely follow what he was saying my lord i dont understand whats happened to my father i told you to sit mormont grumbled sit the raven screamed and have a drink damn you thats a command snow jon sat and took a sip of wine lord eddard has been imprisoned he is charged with treason it is said he plotted with roberts brothers to deny the throne to prince joffrey no jon said at once that couldnt be my father would never betray the king be that as it may said mormont it is not for me to say nor for you but its a lie jon insisted how could they think his father was a traitor had they all gone mad lord eddard stark would never dishonor himself would he he fathered a bastard a small voice whispered inside him where was the honor in that and your page mother what of her he will not even speak her name my lord what will happen to him will they kill him as to that i cannot say lad i mean to send a letter i knew some of the kings councillors in my youth old pycelle lord stannis ser barristan whatever your father has done or hasnt done he is a great lord he must be allowed to take the black and join us here gods knows we need men of lord eddards ability jon knew that other men accused of treason had been allowed to redeem their honor on the wall in days past why not lord eddard his father here that was a strange thought and strangely uncomfortable it would be a monstrous injustice to strip him of winterfell and force him to take the black and yet if it meant his life and would joffrey allow it he remembered the prince at winterfell the way hed mocked robb and ser rodrik in the yard jon himself he had scarcely even noticed bastards were beneath even his contempt my lord will the king listen to you the old bear shrugged a boy king i imagine hell listen to his mother a pity the dwarf isnt with them hes the lads uncle and he saw our need when he visited us it was a bad thing your lady mother taking him captive lady stark is not my mother jon reminded him sharply tyrion lannister had been a friend to him if lord eddard was killed she would be as much to blame as the queen my lord what of my sisters arya and sansa they were with my father do you know pycelle makes no mention of them but doubtless theyll be treated gently i will ask about them when i write mormont shook his head this could not have happened at a worse time if ever the realm needed a strong king there are dark days and cold nights ahead i feel it in my bones he gave jon a long shrewd look i hope you are not thinking of doing anything stupid boy hes myfather jon wanted to say but he knew that mormont would not want to hear it his throat was dry he made himself take another sip of wine your duty is here now the lord commander reminded him your old life ended when you took the black his bird made a raucous echo black mormont took no notice whatever they do in kings landing is none of our concern when jon did not answer the old man finished his wine and said youre free to go ill have no further need of you today on the morrow you can help me write that letter jon did not remember standing or leaving the solar the next he knew he was descending the tower steps thinking this is my father my sisters how can it be none of my concern outside one of the guards looked at him and said be strong boy the gods are cruel they know jon realized my father is no traitor he said hoarsely even the words stuck in his throat as if to choke him the wind was rising and it seemed colder in the yard than it had when hed gone in page spirit summer was drawing to an end the rest of the afternoon passed as if in a dream jon could not have said where he walked what he did who he spoke with ghost was with him he knew that much the silent presence of the direwolf gave him comfort the girls do not even have that much he thought their wolves might have kept them safe but lady is dead and nymerias lost theyre all alone a north wind had begun to blow by the time the sun went down jon could hear it skirling against the wall and over the icy battlements as he went to the common hall for the evening meal hobb had cooked up a venison stew thick with barley onions and carrots when he spooned an extra portion onto jons plate and gave him the crusty heel of the bread he knew what it meant he knows he looked around the hall saw heads turn quickly eyes politely averted they all know his friends rallied to him we asked the septon to light a candle for your father matthar told him its a lie we all know its a lie even grenn knows its a lie pyp chimed in grenn nodded and sam clasped jons hand youre my brother now so hes my father too the fat boy said if you want to go out to the weirwoods and pray to the old gods ill go with you the weirwoods were beyond the wall yet he knew sam meant what he said they are my brothers he thought as much as robb and bran and rickon and then he heard the laughter sharp and cruel as a whip and the voice of ser alliser thorne not only a bastard but a traitors bastard he was telling the men around him in the blink of an eye jon had vaulted onto the table dagger in his hand pyp made a grab for him but he wrenched his leg away and then he was sprinting down the table and kicking the bowl from ser allisers hand stew went flying everywhere spattering the brothers thorne recoiled people were shouting but jon snow did not hear them he lunged at ser allisers face with the dagger slashing at those cold onyx eyes but sam threw himself between them and before jon could get around him pyp was on his back clinging like a monkey and grenn was grabbing his arm while toad wrenched the knife from his fingers later much later after they had marched him back to his sleeping cell mormont came down to see him raven on his shoulder i told you not to do anything stupid boy the old bear said boy the bird chorused mormont shook his head disgusted and to think i had high hopes for you they took his knife and his sword and told him he was not to leave his cell until the high officers met to decide what was to be done with him and then they placed a guard outside his door to make certain he obeyed his friends were not allowed to see him but the old bear did relent and permit him ghost so he was not utterly alone my father is no traitor he told the direwolf when the rest had gone ghost looked at him in silence jon slumped against the wall hands around his knees and stared at the candle on the table beside his narrow bed the flame flickered and swayed the shadows moved around him the room seemed to grow darker and colder i will not sleep tonight jon thought yet he must have dozed when he woke his legs were stiff and cramped and the candle had long since page burned out ghost stood on his hind legs scrabbling at the door jon was startled to see how tall hed grown ghost what is it he called softly the direwolf turned his head and looked down at him baring his fangs in a silent snarl has he gone mad jon wondered its me ghost he murmured trying not to sound afraid yet he was trembling violently when had it gotten so cold ghost backed away from the door there were deep gouges where hed raked the wood jon watched him with mounting disquiet theres someone out there isnt there he whispered crouching the direwolf crept backward white fur rising on the back of his neck the guard he thought they left a man to guard my door ghost smells him through the door thats all it is slowly jon pushed himself to his feet he was shivering uncontrollably wishing he still had a sword three quick steps brought him to the door he grabbed the handle and pulled it inward the creak of the hinges almost made him jump his guard was sprawled bonelessly across the narrow steps looking up at him looking up at him even though he was lying on his stomach his head had been twisted completely around it cant be jon told himself this is the lord commanders tower its guarded day and night this couldnt happen its a dream im having a nightmare ghost slid past him out the door the wolf started up the steps stopped looked back at jon that was when he heard it the soft scrape of a boot on stone the sound of a latch turning the sounds came from above from the lord commanders chambers a nightmare this might be yet it was no dream the guards sword was in its sheath jon knelt and worked it free the heft of steel in his fist made him bolder he moved up the steps ghost padding silently before him shadows lurked in every turn of the stair jon crept up warily probing any suspicious darkness with the point of his sword suddenly he heard the shriek of mormonts raven corn the bird was screaming corn corn corn corn corn corn ghost bounded ahead and jon came scrambling after the door to mormonts solar was wide open the direwolf plunged through jon stopped in the doorway blade in hand giving his eyes a moment to adjust heavy drapes had been pulled across the windows and the darkness was black as ink whos there he called out then he saw it a shadow in the shadows sliding toward the inner door that led to mormonts sleeping cell a manshape all in black cloaked and hooded but beneath the hood its eyes shone with an icy blue radiance ghost leapt man and wolf went down together with neither scream nor snarl rolling smashing into a chair knocking over a table laden with papers mormonts raven was flapping overhead screaming corn corn corn corn jon felt as blind as maester aemon keeping the wall to his back he slid toward the window and ripped down the curtain moonlight flooded the solar he glimpsed black hands buried in white fur swollen dark fingers tightening around his direwolfs throat ghost was twisting and page snapping legs flailing in the air but he could not break free jon had no time to be afraid he threw himself forward shouting bringing down the longsword with all his weight behind it steel sheared through sleeve and skin and bone yet the sound was wrong somehow the smell that engulfed him was so queer and cold he almost gagged he saw arm and hand on the floor black fingers wriggling in a pool of moonlight ghost wrenched free of the other hand and crept away red tongue lolling from his mouth the hooded man lifted his pale moon face and jon slashed at it without hesitation the sword laid the intruder open to the bone taking off half his nose and opening a gash cheek to cheek under those eyes eyes eyes like blue stars burning jon knew that face othor he thought reeling back gods hes dead hes dead i saw him dead he felt something scrabble at his ankle black fingers clawed at his calf the arm was crawling up his leg ripping at wool and flesh shouting with revulsion jon pried the fingers off his leg with the point of his sword and flipped the thing away it lay writhing fingers opening and closing the corpse lurched forward there was no blood onearmed face cut near in half it seemed to feel nothing jon held the longsword before him stay away he commanded his voice gone shrill corn screamed the raven corn corn the severed arm was wriggling out of its torn sleeve a pale snake with a black fivefingered head ghost pounced and got it between his teeth finger bones crunched jon hacked at the corpses neck felt the steel bite deep and hard dead othor slammed into him knocking him off his feet jons breath went out of him as the fallen table caught him between his shoulder blades the sword where was the sword hed lost the damned sword when he opened his mouth to scream the wight jammed its black corpse fingers into jons mouth gagging he tried to shove it off but the dead man was too heavy its hand forced itself farther down his throat icy cold choking him its face was against his own filling the world frost covered its eyes sparkling blue jon raked cold flesh with his nails and kicked at the things legs he tried to bite tried to punch tried to breathe and suddenly the corpses weight was gone its fingers ripped from his throat it was all jon could do to roll over retching and shaking ghost had it again he watched as the direwolf buried his teeth in the wights gut and began to rip and tear he watched only half conscious for a long moment before he finally remembered to look for his sword and saw lord mormont naked and groggy from sleep standing in the doorway with an oil lamp in hand gnawed and fingerless the arm thrashed on the floor wriggling toward him jon tried to shout but his voice was gone staggering to his feet he kicked the arm away and snatched the lamp from the old bears fingers the flame flickered and almost died bum the raven cawed bum bum bum spinning jon saw the drapes hed ripped from the window he flung the lamp into the puddled cloth with both hands metal crunched glass shattered oil spewed and the hangings went up in a great whoosh of flame the heat of it on his face was sweeter than any kiss jon had ever known ghost he page shouted the direwolf wrenched free and came to him as the wight struggled to rise dark snakes spilling from the great wound in its belly jon plunged his hand into the flames grabbed a fistful of the burning drapes and whipped them at the dead man let it bum he prayed as the cloth smothered the corpse gods please please let it bum bran the karstarks came in on a cold windy morning bringing three hundred horsemen and near two thousand foot from their castle at karhold the steel points of their pikes winked in the pale sunlight as the column approached a man went before them pounding out a slow deepthroated marching rhythm on a drum that was bigger than he was boom boom boom bran watched them come from a guard turret atop the outer wall peering through maester luwins bronze fareye while perched on hodors shoulders lord rickard himself led them his sons harrion and eddard and torrhen riding beside him beneath nightblack banners emblazoned with the white sunburst of their house old nan said they had stark blood in them going back hundreds of years but they did not look like starks to bran they were big men and fierce faces covered with thick beards hair worn loose past the shoulders their cloaks were made of skins the pelts of bear and sea and wolf they were the last he knew the other lords were already here with their hosts bran yearned to ride out among them to see the winter houses full to bursting the jostling crowds in the market square every morning the streets rutted and torn by wheel and hoof but robb had forbidden him to leave the castle we have no men to spare to guard you his brother had explained ill take summer bran argued dont act the boy with me bran robb said you know better than that only two days ago one of lord boltons men knifed one of lord cerwyns at the smoking log our lady mother would skin me for a pelt if i let you put yourself at risk he was using the voice of robb the lord when he said it bran knew that meant there was no appeal it was because of what had happened in the wolfswood he knew the memory still gave him bad dreams he had been as helpless as a baby no more able to defend himself than rickon would have been less even rickon would have kicked them at the least it shamed him he was only a few years younger than robb if his brother was almost a man grown so was he he should have been able to protect himself a year ago before he would have visited the town even if it meant climbing over the walls by himself in those days he could run down stairs get on and off his pony by himself and wield a wooden sword good enough to knock prince tommen in the dirt now he could only watch peering out through maester luwins lens tube the maester had taught him all the banners the mailed fist of the glovers silver on scarlet lady mormonts black bear the hideous flayed man that went before roose bolton of the dreadfort a bull moose for the hornwoods a battleaxe for the cerwyns three sentinel trees for the tallharts and the fearsome sigil of house umber a roaring giant in shattered chains page and soon enough he learned the faces too when the lords and their sons and knights retainer came to winterfell to feast even the great hall was not large enough to seat all of them at once so robb hosted each of the principal bannermen in turn bran was always given the place of honor at his brothers right hand some of the lords bannermen gave him queer hard stares as he sat there as if they wondered by what right a green boy should be placed above them and him a cripple too how many is it now bran asked maester luwin as lord karstark and his sons rode through the gates in the outer wall twelve thousand men or near enough as makes no matter how many knights few enough the maester said with a touch of impatience to be a knight you must stand your vigil in a sept and be anointed with the seven oils to consecrate your vows in the north only a few of the great houses worship the seven the rest honor the old gods and name no knights but those lords and their sons and sworn swords are no less fierce or loyal or honorable a mans worth is not marked by a ser before his name as i have told you a hundred times before still said bran how many knights maester luwin sighed three hundred perhaps four among three thousand armored lances who are not knights lord karstark is the last bran said thoughtfully robb will feast him tonight no doubt he will how long before before they go he must march soon or not at all maester luwin said the winter town is full to bursting and this army of his will eat the countryside clean if it camps here much longer others are waiting to join him all along the kingsroad barrow knights and crannogmen and the lords manderly and flint the fighting has begun in the riverlands and your brother has many leagues to go i know bran felt as miserable as he sounded he handed the bronze tube back to the maester and noticed how thin luwins hair had grown on top he could see the pink of scalp showing through it felt queer to look down on him this way when hed spent his whole life looking up at him but when you sat on hodors back you looked down on everyone i dont want to watch anymore hodor take me back to the keep hodor said hodor maester luwin tucked the tube up his sleeve bran your lord brother will not have time to see you now he must greet lord karstark and his sons and make them welcome i wont trouble robb i want to visit the godswood he put his hand on hodors shoulder hodor page a series of chiselcut handholds made a ladder in the granite of the towers inner wall hodor hummed tunelessly as he went down hand under hand bran bouncing against his back in the wicker seat that maester luwin had fashioned for him luwin had gotten the idea from the baskets the women used to carry firewood on their backs after that it had been a simple matter of cutting legholes and attaching some new straps to spread brans weight more evenly it was not as good as riding dancer but there were places dancer could not go and this did not shame bran the way it did when hodor carried him in his arms like a baby hodor seemed to like it too though with hodor it was hard to tell the only tricky part was doors sometimes hodor forgot that he had bran on his back and that could be painful when he went through a door for near a fortnight there had been so many comings and goings that robb ordered both portcullises kept up and the drawbridge down between them even in the dead of night a long column of armored lancers was crossing the moat between the walls when bran emerged from the tower karstark men following their lords into the castle they wore black iron halfhelms and black woolen cloaks patterned with the white sunburst hodor trotted along beside them smiling to himself his boots thudding against the wood of the drawbridge the riders gave them queer looks as they went by and once bran heard someone guffaw he refused to let it trouble him men will look at you maester luwin had warned him the first time they had strapped the wicker basket around hodors chest they will look and they will talk and some will mock you let them mock bran thought no one mocked him in his bedchamber but he would not live his life in bed as they passed beneath the gatehouse portcullis bran put two fingers into his mouth and whistled summer came loping across the yard suddenly the karstark lancers were fighting for control as their horses rolled their eyes and whickered in dismay one stallion reared screaming his rider cursing and hanging on desperately the scent of the direwolves sent horses into a frenzy of fear if they were not accustomed to it but theyd quiet soon enough once summer was gone the godswood bran reminded hodor even winterfell itself was crowded the yard rang to the sound of sword and axe the rumble of wagons and the barking of dogs the armory doors were open and bran glimpsed mikken at his forge his hammer ringing as sweat dripped off his bare chest bran had never seen as many strangers in all his years not even when king robert had come to visit father he tried not to flinch as hodor ducked through a low door they walked down a long dim hallway summer padding easily beside them the wolf glanced up from time to time eyes smoldering like liquid gold bran would have liked to touch him but he was riding too high for his hand to reach the godswood was an island of peace in the sea of chaos that winterfell had become hodor made his way through the dense stands of oak and ironwood and sentinels to the still pool beside the heart tree he stopped under the gnarled limbs of the weirwood humming bran reached up over his head and pulled himself out of his seat drawing the dead weight of his legs up through the holes in the wicker basket he hung for a moment dangling the dark red leaves brushing against his face until hodor lifted him and lowered him to the smooth stone beside the water i want to be by myself for a while he said you go soak go to the pools page hodor hodor stomped through the trees and vanished across the godswood beneath the windows of the guest house an underground hot spring fed three small ponds steam rose from the water day and night and the wall that loomed above was thick with moss hodor hated cold water and would fight like a treed wildcat when threatened with soap but he would happily immerse himself in the hottest pool and sit for hours giving a loud burp to echo the spring whenever a bubble rose from the murky green depths to break upon the surface summer lapped at the water and settled down at brans side he rubbed the wolf under the jaw and for a moment boy and beast both felt at peace bran had always liked the godswood even before but of late he found himself drawn to it more and more even the heart tree no longer scared him the way it used to the deep red eyes carved into the pale trunk still watched him yet somehow he took comfort from that now the gods were looking over him he told himself the old gods gods of the starks and the first men and the children of the forest hisfathers gods he felt safe in their sight and the deep silence of the trees helped him think bran had been thinking a lot since his fall thinking and dreaming and talking with the gods please make it so robb wont go away he prayed softly he moved his hand through the cold water sending ripples across the pool please make him stay or if he has to go bring him home safe with mother and father and the girls and make it make it so rickon understands his baby brother had been wild as a winter storm since he learned robb was riding off to war weeping and angry by turns hed refused to eat cried and screamed for most of a night even punched old nan when she tried to sing him to sleep and the next day hed vanished robb had set half the castle searching for him and when at last theyd found him down in the crypts rickon had slashed at them with a rusted iron sword hed snatched from a dead kings hand and shaggydog had come slavering out of the darkness like a greeneyed demon the wolf was near as wild as rickon hed bitten gage on the arm and torn a chunk of flesh from mikkens thigh it had taken robb himself and grey wind to bring him to bay farlen had the black wolf chained up in the kennels now and rickon cried all the more for being without him maester luwin counseled robb to remain at winterfell and bran pleaded with him too for his own sake as much as rickons but his brother only shook his head stubbornly and said i dont want to go i have to it was only half a lie someone had to go to hold the neck and help the tullys against the lannisters bran could understand that but it did not have to be robb his brother might have given the command to hal mollen or theon greyjoy or to one of his lords bannermen maester luwin urged him to do just that but robb would not hear of it my lord father would never have sent men off to die while he huddled like a craven behind the walls of winterfell he said all robb the lord robb seemed half a stranger to bran now transformed a lord in truth though he had not yet seen his sixteenth name day even their fathers bannermen seemed to sense it many tried to test him each in his own way roose bolton and robett glover both demanded the honor of battle command the first brusquely the second with a smile and a jest stout greyhaired maege mormont dressed in mail like a man told robb bluntly that he was young enough to be her grandson and had no business giving her commands but as it happened she had a granddaughter she would be willing to have him marry softspoken lord cerwyn had actually brought his daughter with him a plump homely maid of thirty years who sat at her fathers left hand and never lifted her eyes from her plate jovial lord hornwood had no daughters but he did bring gifts a horse one day a haunch of venison the next a silverchased page hunting horn the day after and he asked nothing in return nothing but a certain holdfast taken from his grandfather and hunting rights north of a certain ridge and leave to dam the white knife if it please the lord robb answered each of them with cool courtesy much as father might have and somehow he bent them to his will and when lord umber who was called the greatjon by his men and stood as tall as hodor and twice as wide threatened to take his forces home if he was placed behind the hornwoods or the cerwyns in the order of march robb told him he was welcome to do so and when we are done with the lannisters he promised scratching grey wind behind the ear we will march back north root you out of your keep and hang you for an oathbreaker cursing the greatjon flung a flagon of ale into the fire and bellowed that robb was so green he must piss grass when hallis mollen moved to restrain him he knocked him to the floor kicked over a table and unsheathed the biggest ugliest greatsword that bran had ever seen all along the benches his sons and brothers and sworn swords leapt to their feet grabbing for their steel yet robb only said a quiet word and in a snarl and the blink of an eye lord umber was on his back his sword spinning on the floor three feet away and his hand dripping blood where grey wind had bitten off two fingers my lord father taught me that it was death to bare steel against your liege lord robb said but doubtless you only meant to cut my meat brans bowels went to water as the greatjon struggled to rise sucking at the red stumps of fingers but then astonishingly the huge man laughed your meat he roared is bloody tough and somehow after that the greatjon became robbs right hand his staunchest champion loudly telling all and sundry that the boy lord was a stark after all and theyd damn well better bend their knees if they didnt fancy having them chewed off yet that very night his brother came to brans bedchamber pale and shaken after the fires had burned low in the great hall i thought he was going to kill me robb confessed did you see the way he threw down hal like he was no bigger than rickon gods i was so scared and the greatjons not the worst of them only the loudest lord roose never says a word he only looks at me and all i can think of is that room they have in the dreadfort where the boltons hang the skins of their enemies thats just one of old nans stories bran said a note of doubt crept into his voice isnt it i dont know he gave a weary shake of his head lord cerwyn means to take his daughter south with us to cook for him he says theon is certain ill find the girl in my bedroll one night i wish i wish father was here that was the one thing they could agree on bran and rickon and robb the lord they all wished father was here but lord eddard was a thousand leagues away a captive in some dungeon a hunted fugitive running for his life or even dead no one seemed to know for certain every traveler told a different tale each more terrifying than the last the heads of fathers guardsmen were rotting on the walls of the red keep impaled on spikes king robert was dead at fathers hands the baratheons had laid siege to kings landing lord eddard had fled south with the kings wicked brother renly arya and sansa had been murdered by the hound mother had killed tyrion the imp and hung his body from the walls of page riverrun lord tywin lannister was marching on the eyrie burning and slaughtering as he went one winesodden taleteller even claimed that rhaegar targaryen had returned from the dead and was marshaling a vast host of ancient heroes on dragonstone to reclaim his fathers throne when the raven came bearing a letter marked with fathers own seal and written in sansas hand the cruel truth seemed no less incredible bran would never forget the look on robbs face as he stared at their sisters words she says father conspired at treason with the kings brothers he read king robert is dead and mother and i are summoned to the red keep to swear fealty to joffrey she says we must be loyal and when she marries jofftey she will plead with him to spare our lord fathers life his fingers closed into a fist crushing sansas letter between them and she says nothing of arya nothing not so much as a word damn her whats wrong with the girl bran felt all cold inside she lost her wolf he said weakly remembering the day when four of his fathers guardsmen had returned from the south with ladys bones summer and grey wind and shaggydog had begun to howl before they crossed the drawbridge in voices drawn and desolate beneath the shadow of the first keep was an ancient lichyard its headstones spotted with pale lichen where the old kings of winter had laid their faithful servants it was there they buried lady while her brothers stalked between the graves like restless shadows she had gone south and only her bones had returned their grandfather old lord rickard had gone as well with his son brandon who was fathers brother and two hundred of his best men none had ever returned and father had gone south with arya and sansa and jory and hullen and fat tom and the rest and later mother and ser rodrik had gone and they hadnt come back either and now robb meant to go not to kings landing and not to swear fealty but to riverrun with a sword in his hand and if their lord father were truly a prisoner that could mean his death for a certainty it frightened bran more than he could say if robb has to go watch over him bran entreated the old gods as they watched him with the heart trees red eyes and watch over his men hal and quent and the rest and lord umber and lady mormont and the other lords and theon too i suppose watch them and keep them safe if it please you gods help them defeat the lannisters and save father and bring them home a faint wind sighed through the godswood and the red leaves stirred and whispered summer bared his teeth you hear them boy a voice asked bran lifted his head osha stood across the pool beneath an ancient oak her face shadowed by leaves even in irons the wildling moved quiet as a cat summer circled the pool sniffed at her the tall woman flinched summer to me bran called the direwolf took one final sniff spun and bounded back bran wrapped his arms around him what are you doing here he had not seen osha since theyd taken her captive in the wolfswood though he knew shed been set to working in the kitchens they are my gods too osha said beyond the wall they are the only gods her hair was growing page out brown and shaggy it made her look more womanly that and the simple dress of brown roughspun theyd given her when they took her mail and leather gage lets me have my prayers from time to time when i feel the need and i let him do as he likes under my skirt when he feels the need its nothing to me i like the smell of flour on his hands and hes gentler than stiv she gave an awkward bow ill leave you theres pots that want scouring no stay bran commanded her tell me what you meant about hearing the gods osha studied him you asked them and theyre answering open your ears listen youll hear bran listened its only the wind he said after a moment uncertain the leaves are rustling who do you think sends the wind if not the gods she seated herself across the pool from him clinking faintly as she moved mikken had fixed iron manacles to her ankles with a heavy chain between them she could walk so long as she kept her strides small but there was no way for her to run or climb or mount a horse they see you boy they hear you talking that rustling thats them talking back what are they saying theyre sad your lord brother will get no help from them not where hes going the old gods have no power in the south the weirwoods there were all cut down thousands of years ago how can they watch your brother when they have no eyes bran had not thought of that it frightened him if even the gods could not help his brother what hope was there maybe osha wasnt hearing them right he cocked his head and tried to listen again he thought he could hear the sadness now but nothing more than that the rustling grew louder bran heard muffled footfalls and a low humming and hodor came blundering out of the trees naked and smiling hodor he must have heard our voices bran said hodor you forgot your clothes hodor hodor agreed he was dripping wet from the neck down steaming in the chill air his body was covered with brown hair thick as a pelt between his legs his manhood swung long and heavy osha eyed him with a sour smile now theres a big man she said he has giants blood in him or im the queen maester luwin says there are no more giants he says theyre all dead like the children of the forest all thats left of them are old bones in the earth that men turn up with plows from time to time let maester luwin ride beyond the wall osha said hell find giants then or theyll find him my brother killed one ten foot tall she was and stunted at that theyve been known to grow big as twelve and thirteen feet fierce things they are too all hair and teeth and the wives have beards like their husbands so theres no telling them apart the women take human men for lovers and its from them the half bloods come it goes harder on the women they catch the men are so big theyll rip a maid apart before they get her with child she grinned at him but you dont know what i mean do you boy yes i do bran insisted he understood about mating he had seen dogs in the yard and watched a page stallion mount a mare but talking about it made him uncomfortable he looked at hodor go back and bring your clothes hodor he said go dress hodor he walked back the way he had come ducking under a lowhanging tree limb he was awfully big bran thought as he watched him go are there truly giants beyond the wall he asked osha uncertainly giants and worse than giants lordling i tried to tell your brother when he asked his questions him and your maester and that smiley boy greyjoy the cold winds are rising and men go out from their fires and never come back or if they do theyre not men no more but only wights with blue eyes and cold black hands why do you think i run south with stiv and hali and the rest of them fools mance thinks hell fight the brave sweet stubborn man like the white walkers were no more than rangers but what does he know he can call himself kingbeyondthewall all he likes but hes still just another old black crow who flew down from the shadow tower hes never tasted winter i was born up there child like my mother and her mother before her and her mother before her born of the free folk we remember osha stood her chains rattling together i tried to tell your lordling brother only yesterday when i saw him in the yard miord stark i called to him respectful as you please but he looked through me and that sweaty oaf greatjon umber shoves me out of the path so be it ill wear my irons and hold my tongue a man who wont listen cant hear tell me robb will listen to me i know he will will he now well see you tell him this mord you tell him hes bound on marching the wrong way its north he should be taking his swords north not south you hear me bran nodded ill tell him but that night when they feasted in the great hall robb was not with them he took his meal in the solar instead with lord rickard and the greatjon and the other lords bannermen to make the final plans for the long march to come it was left to bran to fill his place at the head of the table and act the host to lord karstarks sons and honored friends they were already at their places when hodor carried bran into the hall on his back and knelt beside the high seat two of the serving men helped lift him from his basket bran could feel the eyes of every stranger in the hall it had grown quiet my lords hallis mollen announced brandon stark of winterfell i welcome you to our fires bran said stiffly and offer you meat and mead in honor of our friendship harrion karstark the oldest of lord rickards sons bowed and his brothers after him yet as they settled back in their places he heard the younger two talking in low voices over the clatter of wine cups sooner die than live like that muttered one his fathers namesake eddard and his brother torrhen said likely the boy was broken inside as well as out too craven to take his own life broken bran thought bitterly as he clutched his knife is that what he was now bran the broken i dont want to be broken he whispered fiercely to maester luwin whod been seated to his right i want to be a knight there are some who call my order the knights of the mind luwin replied you are a surpassing clever boy when you work at it bran have you ever thought that you might wear a maesters chain there is page no limit to what you might learn i want to learn magic bran told him the crow promised that i would fly maester luwin sighed i can teach you history healing herblore i can teach you the speech of ravens and how to build a castle and the way a sailor steers his ship by the stars i can teach you to measure the days and mark the seasons and at the citadel in oldtown they can teach you a thousand things more but bran no man can teach you magic the children could bran said the children of the forest that reminded him of the promise he had made to osha in the godswood so he told luwin what she had said the maester listened politely the wildling woman could give old nan lessons in telling tales i think he said when bran was done i will talk with her again if you like but it would be best if you did not trouble your brother with this folly he has more than enough to concern him without fretting over giants and dead men in the woods its the lannisters who hold your lord father bran not the children of the forest he put a gentle hand on brans arm think on what i said child and two days later as a red dawn broke across a windswept sky bran found himself in the yard beneath the gatehouse strapped atop dancer as he said his farewells to his brother you are the lord in winterfell now robb told him he was mounted on a shaggy grey stallion his shield hung from the horses side wood banded with iron white and grey and on it the snarling face of a direwolf his brother wore grey chainmail over bleached leathers sword and dagger at his waist a furtrimmed cloak across his shoulders you must take my place as i took fathers until we come home i know bran replied miserably he had never felt so little or alone or scared he did not know how to be a lord listen to maester luwins counsel and take care of rickon tell him that ill be back as soon as the fighting is done rickon had refused to come down he was up in his chamber redeyed and defiant no hed screamed when bran had asked if he didnt want to say farewell to robb no farewell i told him bran said he says no one ever comes back he cant be a baby forever hes a stark and near four robb sighed well mother will be home soon and ill bring back father i promise he wheeled his courser around and trotted away grey wind followed loping beside the warhorse lean and swift hallis mollen went before them through the gate carrying the rippling white banner of house stark atop a high standard of grey ash theon greyjoy and the greatjon fell in on either side of robb and their knights formed up in a double column behind them steeltipped lances glinting in the sun uncomfortably he remembered oshas words hes marching the wrong way he thought for an instant page he wanted to gallop after him and shout a warning but when robb vanished beneath the portcullis the moment was gone beyond the castle walls a roar of sound went up the foot soldiers and townsfolk were cheering robb as he rode past bran knew cheering for lord stark for the lord of winterfell on his great stallion with his cloak streaming and grey wind racing beside him they would never cheer for him that way he realized with a dull ache he might be the lord in winterfell while his brother and father were gone but he was still bran the broken he could not even get off his own horse except to fall when the distant cheers had faded to silence and the yard was empty at last winterfell seemed deserted and dead bran looked around at the faces of those who remained women and children and old men and hodor the huge stableboy had a lost and frightened look to his face hodor he said sadly hodor bran agreed wondering what it meant daenerys when he had taken his pleasure khal drogo rose from their sleeping mats to tower above her his skin shone dark as bronze in the ruddy light from the brazier the faint lines of old scars visible on his broad chest inkblack hair loose and unbound cascaded over his shoulders and down his back well past his waist his manhood glistened wetly the khals mouth twisted in a frown beneath the droop of his long mustachio the stallion who mounts the world has no need of iron chairs dany propped herself on an elbow to look up at him so tall and magnificent she loved his hair especially it had never been cut he had never known defeat it was prophesied that the stallion will ride to the ends of the earth she said the earth ends at the black salt sea drogo answered at once he wet a cloth in a basin of warm water to wipe the sweat and oil from his skin no horse can cross the poison water in the free cities there are ships by the thousand dany told him as she had told him before wooden horses with a hundred legs that fly across the sea on wings full of wind khal drogo did not want to hear it we will speak no more of wooden horses and iron chairs he dropped the cloth and began to dress this day i will go to the grass and hunt woman wife he announced as he shrugged into a painted vest and buckled on a wide belt with heavy medallions of silver gold and bronze yes my sunandstars dany said drogo would take his bloodriders and ride in search of hrakkar the great white lion of the plains if they returned triumphant her lord husbands joy would be fierce and he might be willing to hear her out page savage beasts he did not fear nor any man who had ever drawn breath but the sea was a different matter to the dothraki water that a horse could not drink was something foul the heaving greygreen plains of the ocean filled them with superstitious loathing drogo was a bolder man than the other horselords in half a hundred ways she had found but not in this if only she could get him onto a ship after the khal and his bloodriders had ridden off with their bows dany summoned her handmaids her body felt so fat and ungainly now that she welcomed the help of their strong arms and deft hands whereas before she had often been uncomfortable with the way they fussed and fluttered about her they scrubbed her clean and dressed her in sandsilk loose and flowing as doreah combed out her hair she sent jhiqui to find ser jorah mormont the knight came at once he wore horsehair leggings and painted vest like a rider coarse black hair covered his thick chest and muscular arms my princess how may i serve you you must talk to my lord husband dany said drogo says the stallion who mounts the world will have all the lands of the earth to rule and no need to cross the poison water he talks of leading his khalasar east after rhaego is born to plunder the lands around the jade sea the knight looked thoughtful the khal has never seen the seven kingdoms he said they are nothing to him if he thinks of them at all no doubt he thinks of islands a few small cities clinging to rocks in the manner of lorath or lys surrounded by stormy seas the riches of the east must seem a more tempting prospect but he must ride west dany said despairing please help me make him understand she had never seen the seven kingdoms either no more than drogo yet she felt as though she knew them from all the tales her brother had told her viserys had promised her a thousand times that he would take her back one day but he was dead now and his promises had died with him the dothraki do things in their own time for their own reasons the knight answered have patience princess do not make your brothers mistake we will go home i promise you home the word made her feel sad ser jorah had his bear island but what was home to her a few tales names recited as solemnly as the words of a prayer the fading memory of a red door was vaes dothrak to be her home forever when she looked at the crones of the dosh khaleen was she looking at her future ser jorah must have seen the sadness on her face a great caravan arrived during the night khaleesi four hundred horses from pentos by way of norvos and qohor under the command of merchant captain byan votyris illyrio may have sent a letter would you care to visit the western market dany stirred yes she said i would like that the markets came alive when a caravan had come in you could never tell what treasures the traders might bring this time and it would be good to hear men speaking valyrian again as they did in the free cities irri have them prepare a litter i shall tell your khas ser jorah said withdrawing page if khal drogo had been with her dany would have ridden her silver among the dothraki mothers stayed on horseback almost up to the moment of birth and she did not want to seem weak in her husbands eyes but with the khal off hunting it was pleasant to lie back on soft cushions and be carried across vaes dothrak with red silk curtains to shield her from the sun ser jorah saddled up and rode beside her with the four young men of her khas and her handmaids the day was warm and cloudless the sky a deep blue when the wind blew she could smell the rich scents of grass and earth as her litter passed beneath the stolen monuments she went from sunlight to shadow and back again dany swayed along studying the faces of dead heroes and forgotten kings she wondered if the gods of burned cities could still answer prayers if i were not the blood of the dragon she thought wistfully this could be my home she was khaleesi she had a strong man and a swift horse handmaids to serve her warriors to keep her safe an honored place in the dosh khaleen awaiting her when she grew old and in her womb grew a son who would one day bestride the world that should be enough for any woman but not for the dragon with viserys gone daenerys was the last the very last she was the seed of kings and conquerors and so too the child inside her she must not forget the western market was a great square of beaten earth surrounded by warrens of mudbaked brick animal pens whitewashed drinking halls hummocks rose from the ground like the backs of great subterranean beasts breaking the surface yawning black mouths leading down to cool and cavernous storerooms below the interior of the square was a maze of stalls and crookback aisles shaded by awnings of woven grass a hundred merchants and traders were unloading their goods and setting up in stalls when they arrived yet even so the great market seemed hushed and deserted compared to the teeming bazaars that dany remembered from pentos and the other free cities the caravans made their way to vaes dothrak from east and west not so much to sell to the dothraki as to trade with each other ser jorah had explained the riders let them come and go unmolested so long as they observed the peace of the sacred city did not profane the mother of mountains or the womb of the world and honored the crones of the dosh khaleen with the traditional gifts of salt silver and seed the dothraki did not truly comprehend this business of buying and selling dany liked the strangeness of the eastern market too with all its queer sights and sounds and smells she often spent her mornings there nibbling tree eggs locust pie and green noodles listening to the high ululating voices of the spellsingers gaping at manticores in silver cages and immense grey elephants and the striped blackandwhite horses of the jogos nhai she enjoyed watching all the people too dark solemn asshaii and tall pale qartheen the brighteyed men of yi ti in monkeytail hats warrior maids from bayasabhad shamyriana and kayakayanaya with iron rings in their nipples and rubies in their cheeks even the dour and frightening shadow men who covered their arms and legs and chests with tattoos and hid their faces behind masks the eastern market was a place of wonder and magic for dany but the western market smelled of home as irri and jhiqui helped her from her litter she sniffed and recognized the sharp odors of garlic and pepper scents that reminded dany of days long gone in the alleys of tyrosh and myr and brought a fond smile to her face under that she smelled the heady sweet perfumes of lys she saw slaves carrying bolts page of intricate myrish lace and fine wools in a dozen rich colors caravan guards wandered among the aisles in copper helmets and kneelength tunics of quilted yellow cotton empty scabbards swinging from their woven leather belts behind one stall an armorer displayed steel breastplates worked with gold and silver in ornate patterns and helms hammered in the shapes of fanciful beasts next to him was a pretty young woman selling lannisport goldwork rings and brooches and torcs and exquisitely wrought medallions suitable for belting a huge eunuch guarded her stall mute and hairless dressed in sweatstained velvets and scowling at anyone who came close across the aisle a fat cloth trader from yi ti was haggling with a pentoshi over the price of some green dye the monkey tail on his hat swaying back and forth as he shook his head when i was a little girl i loved to play in the bazaar dany told ser jorah as they wandered down the shady aisle between the stalls it was so alive there all the people shouting and laughing so many wonderful things to look at though we seldom had enough coin to buy anything well except for a sausage now and again or honeyfingers do they have honeyfingers in the seven kingdoms the kind they bake in tyrosh cakes are they i could not say princess the knight bowed if you would pardon me for a time i will seek out the captain and see if he has letters for us very well ill help you find him there is no need for you to trouble yourself ser jorah glanced away impatiently enjoy the market i will rejoin you when my business is concluded cutious dany thought as she watched him stride off through the throngs she didnt see why she should not go with him perhaps ser jorah meant to find a woman after he met with the merchant captain whores frequently traveled with the caravans she knew and some men were queerly shy about their couplings she gave a shrug come she told the others her handmaids trailed along as dany resumed her stroll through the market oh look she exclaimed to doreah those are the kind of sausages i meant she pointed to a stall where a wizened little woman was grilling meat and onions on a hot firestone they make them with lots of garlic and hot peppers delighted with her discovery dany insisted the others join her for a sausage her handmaids wolfed theirs down giggling and grinning though the men of her khas sniffed at the grilled meat suspiciously they taste different than i remember dany said after her first few bites in pentos i make them with pork the old woman said but all my pigs died on the dothraki sea these are made of horsemeat khaleesi but i spice them the same oh dany felt disappointed but quaro liked his sausage so well he decided to have another one and rakharo had to outdo him and eat three more belching loudly dany giggled you have not laughed since your brother the khal rhaggat was crowned by drogo said irri it is good to see khaleesi dany smiled shyly it was sweet to laugh she felt half a girl again they wandered for half the morning she saw a beautiful feathered cloak from the summer isles and page took it for a gift in return she gave the merchant a silver medallion from her belt that was how it was done among the dothraki a birdseller taught a greenandred parrot to say her name and dany laughed again yet still refused to take him what would she do with a greenandred parrot in a khalasar she did take a dozen flasks of scented oils the perfumes of her childhood she had only to close her eyes and sniff them and she could see the big house with the red door once more when doreah looked longingly at a fertility charm at a magicians booth dany took that too and gave it to the handmaid thinking that now she should find something for irri and jhiqui as well turning a corner they came upon a wine merchant offering thimblesized cups of his wares to the passersby sweet reds he cried in fluent dothraki i have sweet reds from lys and volantis and the arbor whites from lys tyroshi pear brandy firewine pepperwine the pale green nectars of myr smokeberry browns and andalish sours i have them i have them he was a small man slender and handsome his flaxen hair curled and perfumed after the fashion of lys when dany paused before his stall he bowed low a taste for the khaleesi i have a sweet red from dorne my lady it sings of plums and cherries and rich dark oak a cask a cup a swallow one taste and you will name your child after me dany smiled my son has his name but i will try your summerwine she said in valyrian valyrian as they spoke it in the free cities the words felt strange on her tongue after so long just a taste if you would be so kind the merchant must have taken her for dothraki with her clothes and her oiled hair and sunbrowned skin when she spoke he gaped at her in astonishment my lady you are tyroshi can it be so my speech may be tyroshi and my garb dothraki but i am of westeros of the sunset kingdoms dany told him doreah stepped up beside her you have the honor to address daenerys of the house targaryen daenerys stormborn khaleesi of the riding men and princess of the seven kingdoms the wine merchant dropped to his knees princess he said bowing his head rise dany commanded him i would still like to taste that summerwine you spoke of the man bounded to his feet that dornish swill it is not worthy of a princess i have a dry red from the arbor crisp and delectable please let me give you a cask khal drogos visits to the free cities had given him a taste for good wine and dany knew that such a noble vintage would please him you honor me ser she murmured sweetly the honor is mine the merchant rummaged about in the back of his stall and produced a small oaken cask burned into the wood was a cluster of grapes the redwyne sigil he said pointing for the arbor there is no finer drink page khal drogo and i will share it together aggo take this back to my litter if youd be so kind the wineseller beamed as the dothraki hefted the cask she did not realize that ser jorah had returned until she heard the knight say no his voice was strange brusque aggo put down that cask aggo looked at dany she gave a hesitant nod ser jorah is something wrong i have a thirst open it wineseller the merchant frowned the wine is for the khaleesi not for the likes of you ser ser jorah moved closer to the stall if you dont open it ill crack it open with your head he carried no weapons here in the sacred city save his handsyet his hands were enough big hard dangerous his knuckles covered with coarse dark hairs the wineseller hesitated a moment then took up his hammer and knocked the plug from the cask pour ser jorah commanded the four young warriors of danys khas arrayed themselves behind him frowning watching with their dark almondshaped eyes it would be a crime to drink this rich a wine without letting it breathe the wineseller had not put his hammer down jhogo reached for the whip coiled at his belt but dany stopped him with a light touch on the arm do as ser jorah says she said people were stopping to watch the man gave her a quick sullen glance as the princess commands he had to set aside his hammer to lift the cask he filled two thimblesized tasting cups pouring so deftly he did not spill a drop ser jorah lifted a cup and sniffed at the wine frowning sweet isnt it the wineseller said smiling can you smell the fruit ser the perfume of the arbor taste it my lord and tell me it isnt the finest richest wine thats ever touched your tongue ser jorah offered him the cup you taste it first me the man laughed i am not worthy of this vintage my lord and its a poor wine merchant who drinks up his own wares his smile was amiable yet she could see the sheen of sweat on his brow you will drink dany said cold as ice empty the cup or i will tell them to hold you down while ser jorah pours the whole cask down your throat the wineseller shrugged reached for the cup and grabbed the cask instead flinging it at her with both hands ser jorah bulled into her knocking her out of the way the cask bounced off his shoulder and smashed open on the ground dany stumbled and lost her feet no she screamed thrusting her hands out to break her fall and doreah caught her by the arm and wrenched her backward so she landed on her legs and not her belly page the trader vaulted over the stall darting between aggo and rakharo quaro reached for an arakh that was not there as the blond man slammed him aside he raced down the aisle dany heard the snap of jhogos whip saw the leather lick out and coil around the winesellers leg the man sprawled face first in the dirt a dozen caravan guards had come running with them was the master himself merchant captain byan votyris a diminutive norvoshi with skin like old leather and a bristling blue mustachio that swept up to his ears he seemed to know what had happened without a word being spoken take this one away to await the pleasure of the khal he commanded gesturing at the man on the ground two guards hauled the wineseller to his feet his goods i gift to you as well princess the merchant captain went on small token of regret that one of mine would do this thing doreah and jhiqui helped dany back to her feet the poisoned wine was leaking from the broken cask into the dirt how did you know she asked ser jorah trembling how i did not know khaleesi not until the man refused to drink but once i read magister illyrios letter i feared his dark eyes swept over the faces of the strangers in the market come best not to talk of it here dany was near tears as they carried her back the taste in her mouth was one she had known before fear for years she had lived in terror of viserys afraid of waking the dragon this was even worse it was not just for herself that she feared now but for her baby he must have sensed her fright for he moved restlessly inside her dany stroked the swell of her belly gently wishing she could reach him touch him soothe him you are the blood of the dragon little one she whispered as her litter swayed along curtains drawn tight you are the blood of the dragon and the dragon does not fear under the hollow hummock of earth that was her home in vaes dothrak dany ordered them to leave herall but ser jorah tell me she commanded as she lowered herself onto her cushions was it the usurper yes the knight drew out a folded parchment a letter to viserys from magister illyrio robert baratheon offers lands and lordships for your death or your brothers my brother her sob was half a laugh he does not know yet does he the usurper owes drogo a lordship this time her laugh was half a sob she hugged herself protectively and me you said only me you and the child ser jorah said grim no he cannot have my son she would not weep she decided she would not shiver with fear the usurper has woken the dragon now she told herself and her eyes went to the dragons eggs resting in their nest of dark velvet the shifting lamplight linmed their stony scales and shimmering motes of jade and scarlet and gold swam in the air around them like courtiers around a king was it madness that seized her then born of fear or some strange wisdom buried in her blood dany could not have said she heard her own voice saying ser jorah light the brazier khaleesi the knight looked at her strangely it is so hot are you certain page she had never been so certain yes i i have a chill light the brazier he bowed as you command when the coals were afire dany sent ser jorah from her she had to be alone to do what she must do this is madness she told herself as she lifted the blackandscarlet egg from the velvet it will only crack and bum and its so beautiful ser jorah will call me a fool if i ruin it and yet and yet cradling the egg with both hands she carried it to the fire and pushed it down amongst the burning coals the black scales seemed to glow as they drank the heat flames licked against the stone with small red tongues dany placed the other two eggs beside the black one in the fire as she stepped back from the brazier the breath trembled in her throat she watched until the coals had turned to ashes drifting sparks floated up and out of the smokehole heat shimmered in waves around the dragons eggs and that was all your brother rhaegar was the last dragon ser jorah had said dany gazed at her eggs sadly what had she expected a thousand thousand years ago they had been alive but now they were only pretty rocks they could not make a dragon a dragon was air and fire living flesh not dead stone the brazier was cold again by the time khal drogo returned cohollo was leading a packhorse behind him with the carcass of a great white lion slung across its back above the stars were coming out the khal laughed as he swung down off his stallion and showed her the scars on his leg where the hrakkar had raked him through his leggings i shall make you a cloak of its skin moon of my life he swore when dany told him what had happened at the market all laughter stopped and khal drogo grew very quiet this poisoner was the first ser jorah mormont warned him but he will not be the last men will risk much for a lordship drogo was silent for a time finally he said this seller of poisons ran from the moon of my life better he should run after her so he will jhogo jorah the andal to each of you i say choose any horse you wish from my herds and it is yours any horse save my red and the silver that was my bride gift to the moon of my life i make this gift to you for what you did and to rhaego son of drogo the stallion who will mount the world to him i also pledge a gift to him i will give this iron chair his mothers father sat in i will give him seven kingdoms drogo khal will do this thing his voice rose and he lifted his fist to the sky i will take my khalasar west to where the world ends and ride the wooden horses across the black salt water as no khal has done before i will kill the men in the iron suits and tear down their stone houses i will rape their women take their children as slaves and bring their broken gods back to vaes dothrak to bow down beneath the mother of mountains this i vow drogo son of bharbo this i swear before the mother of mountains as the stars look down in witness his khalasar left vaes dothrak two days later striking south and west across the plains khal drogo led them on his great red stallion with daenerys beside him on her silver the wineseller hurried behind them page naked on foot chained at throat and wrists his chains were fastened to the halter of danys silver as she rode he ran after her barefoot and stumbling no harm would come to him so long as he kept up catelyn it was too far to make out the banners clearly but even through the drifting fog she could see that they were white with a dark smudge in their center that could only be the direwolf of stark grey upon its icy field when she saw it with her own eyes catelyn reined up her horse and bowed her head in thanks the gods were good she was not too late they await our coming my lady ser wylis manderly said as my lord father swore they would let us not keep them waiting any longer ser ser brynden tully put the spurs to his horse and trotted briskly toward the banners catelyn rode beside him ser wylis and his brother ser wendel followed leading their levies near fifteen hundred men some twentyodd knights and as many squires two hundred mounted lances swordsmen and freeriders and the rest foot armed with spears pikes and tridents lord wyman had remained behind to see to the defenses of white harbor a man of near sixty years he had grown too stout to sit a horse if i had thought to see war again in my lifetime i should have eaten a few less eels hed told catelyn when he met her ship slapping his massive belly with both hands his fingers were fat as sausages my boys will see you safe to your son though have no fear his boys were both older than catelyn and she might have wished that they did not take after their father quite so closely ser wylis was only a few eels short of not being able to mount his own horse she pitied the poor animal ser wendel the younger boy would have been the fattest man shed ever known had she only neglected to meet his father and brother wylis was quiet and formal wendel loud and boisterous both had ostentatious walrus mustaches and heads as bare as a babys bottom neither seemed to own a single garment that was not spotted with food stains yet she liked them well enough they had gotten her to robb as their father had vowed and nothing else mattered she was pleased to see that her son had sent eyes out even to the east the lannisters would come from the south when they came but it was good that robb was being careful my son is leading a host to war she thought still only half believing it she was desperately afraid for him and for winterfell yet she could not deny feeling a certain pride as well a year ago he had been a boy what was he now she wondered outriders spied the manderly bannersthe white merman with trident in hand rising from a bluegreen seaand hailed them warmly they were led to a spot of high ground dry enough for a camp ser wylis called a halt there and remained behind with his men to see the fires laid and the horses tended while his brother wendel rode on with catelyn and her uncle to present their fathers respects to their liege lord page the ground under their horses hooves was soft and wet it fell away slowly beneath them as they rode past smoky peat fires lines of horses and wagons heavyladen with hardbread and salt beef on a stony outcrop of land higher than the surrounding country they passed a lords pavilion with walls of heavy sailcloth catelyn recognized the banner the bull moose of the hornwoods brown on its dark orange field just beyond through the mists she glimpsed the walls and towers of moat cailin or what remained of them immense blocks of black basalt each as large as a crofters cottage lay scattered and tumbled like a childs wooden blocks halfsunk in the soft boggy soil nothing else remained of a curtain wall that had once stood as high as winterfells the wooden keep was gone entirely rotted away a thousand years past with not so much as a timber to mark where it had stood all that was left of the great stronghold of the first men were three towers three where there had once been twenty if the taletellers could be believed the gatehouse tower looked sound enough and even boasted a a game of thronls few feet of standing wall to either side of it the drunkards tower off in the bog where the south and west walls had once met leaned like a man about to spew a bellyful of wine into the gutter and the tall slender childrens tower where legend said the children of the forest had once called upon their nameless gods to send the hammer of the waters had lost half its crown it looked as if some great beast had taken a bite out of the crenellations along the tower top and spit the rubble across the bog all three towers were green with moss a tree was growing out between the stones on the north side of the gatehouse tower its gnarled limbs festooned with ropy white blankets of ghostskin gods have mercy ser brynden exclaimed when he saw what lay before them this is moat cailin its no more than a death trap catelyn finished i know how it looks uncle i thought the same the first time i saw it but ned assured me that this ruin is more formidable than it seems the three surviving towers command the causeway from all sides and any enemy must pass between them the bogs here are impenetrable full of quicksands and suckholes and teeming with snakes to assault any of the towers an army would need to wade through waistdeep black muck cross a moat full of lizardlions and scale walls slimy with moss all the while exposing themselves to fire from archers in the other towers she gave her uncle a grim smile and when night falls there are said to be ghosts cold vengeful spirits of the north who hunger for southron blood ser brynden chuckled remind me not to linger here last i looked i was southron myself standards had been raised atop all three towers the karstark sunburst hung from the drunkards tower beneath the direwolf on the childrens tower it was the greatjons giant in shattered chains but on the gatehouse tower the stark banner flew alone that was where robb had made his seat catelyn made for it with ser brynden and ser wendel behind her their horses stepping slowly down the logandplank road that had been laid across the greenandblack fields of mud she found her son surrounded by his fathers lords bannermen in a drafty hall with a peat fire smoking in a black hearth he was seated at a massive stone table a pile of maps and papers in front of him talking intently with roose bolton and the greatjon at first he did not notice her but his wolf did the great grey beast was lying near the fire but when catelyn entered he lifted his head and his golden eyes met hers the lords fell silent one by one and robb looked up at the page sudden quiet and saw her mother he said his voice thick with emotion catelyn wanted to run to him to kiss his sweet brow to wrap him in her arms and hold him so tightly that he would never come to harm but here in front of his lords she dared not he was playing a mans part now and she would not take that away from him so she held herself at the far end of the basalt slab they were using for a table the direwolf got to his feet and padded across the room to where she stood it seemed bigger than a wolf ought to be youve grown a beard she said to robb while grey wind sniffed her hand he rubbed his stubbled jaw suddenly awkward yes his chin hairs were redder than the ones on his head i like it catelyn stroked the wolfs head gently it makes you look like my brother edmure grey wind nipped at her fingers playful and trotted back to his place by the fire ser helman tallhart was the first to follow the direwolf across the room to pay his respects kneeling before her and pressing his brow to her hand lady catelyn he said you are fair as ever a welcome sight in troubled times the glovers followed galbart and robett and greatjon umber and the rest one by one theon greyjoy was the last i had not looked to see you here my lady he said as he knelt i had not thought to be here catelyn said until i came ashore at white harbor and lord wyman told me that robb had called the banners you know his son ser wendel wendel manderly stepped forward and bowed as low as his girth would allow and my uncle ser brynden tully who has left my sisters service for mine the blackfish robb said thank you for joining us ser we need men of your courage and you ser wendel i am glad to have you here is ser rodrik with you as well mother ive missed him ser rodrik is on his way north from white harbor i have named him castellan and commanded him to hold winterfell till our return maester luwin is a wise counsellor but unskilled in the arts of war have no fear on that count lady stark the greatjon told her in his bass rumble winterfell is safe well shove our swords up tywin lannisters bunghole soon enough begging your pardons and then its on to the red keep to free ned my lady a question as it please you roose bolton lord of the dreadfort had a small voice yet when he spoke larger men quieted to listen his eyes were curiously pale almost without color and his look disturbing it is said that you hold lord tywins dwarf son as captive have you brought him to us i vow we should make good use of such a hostage i did hold tyrion lannister but no longer catelyn was forced to admit a chorus of consternation greeted the news i was no more pleased than you my lords the gods saw fit to free him with some help from my fool of a sister she ought not to be so open in her contempt she knew but her parting from the eyrie had not been pleasant she had offered to take lord robert with her to foster him at winterfell for a few years the company of other boys would do him good she had dared to suggest lysas rage had been frightening to behold sister or no she had replied if you try to steal my son you page will leave by the moon door after that there was no more to be said the lords were anxious to question her further but catelyn raised a hand no doubt we will have time for all this later but my journey has fatigued me i would speak with my son alone i know you will forgive me my lords she gave them no choice led by the everobliging lord hornwood the bannermen bowed and took their leave and you theon she added when greyjoy lingered he smiled and left them there was ale and cheese on the table catelyn tilled a horn sat sipped and studied her son he seemed taller than when shed left and the wisps of beard did make him look older edmure was sixteen when he grew his first whiskers i will be sixteen soon enough robb said and you are fifteen now fifteen and leading a host to battle can you understand why i might fear robb his look grew stubborn there was no one else no one she said pray who were those men i saw here a moment ago roose bolton rickard karstark galbart and robett glover the greatjon heiman tallhart you might have given the command to any of them gods be good you might even have sent theon though he would not be my choice they are not starks he said they are men robb seasoned in battle you were fighting with wooden swords less than a year past she saw anger in his eyes at that but it was gone as quick as it came and suddenly he was a boy again i know he said abashed are you are you sending me back to winterfell catelyn sighed i should you ought never have left yet i dare not not now you have come too far someday these lords will look to you as their liege if i pack you off now like a child being sent to bed without his supper they will remember and laugh about it in their cups the day will come when you need them to respect you even fear you a little laughter is poison to fear i will not do that to you much as i might wish to keep you safe you have my thanks mother he said his relief obvious beneath the formality she reached across his table and touched his hair you are my firstborn robb i have only to look at you to remember the day you came into the world redfaced and squalling he rose clearly uncomfortable with her touch and walked to the hearth grey wind rubbed his head against his leg you know about father yes the reports of roberts sudden death and neds fall had frightened catelyn more than she could say but she would not let her son see her fear lord manderly told me when i landed at white harbor have you had any word of your sisters page there was a letter robb said scratching his direwolf under the jaw one for you as well but it came to winterfell with mine he went to the table rummaged among some maps and papers and returned with a crumpled parchment this is the one she wrote me i never thought to bring yours something in robbs tone troubled her she smoothed out the paper and read concern gave way to disbelief then to anger and lastly to fear this is cerseis letter not your sisters she said when she was done the real message is in what sansa does not say all this about how kindly and gently the lannisters are treating her i know the sound of a threat even whispered they have sansa hostage and they mean to keep her theres no mention of arya robb pointed out miserable no catelyn did not want to think what that might mean not now not here i had hoped if you still held the imp a trade of hostages he took sansas letter and crumpled it in his fist and she could tell from the way he did it that it was not the first time is there word from the eyrie i wrote to aunt lysa asking help has she called lord arryns banners do you know will the knights of the vale come join us only one she said the best of them my uncle but brynden blackfish was a tully first my sister is not about to stir beyond her bloody gate robb took it hard mother what are we going to do i brought this whole army together eighteen thousand men but i dont im not certain he looked to her his eyes shining the proud young lord melted away in an instant and quick as that he was a child again a fifteenyearold boy looking to his mother for answers it would not do what are you so afraid of robb she asked gently i he turned his head away to hide the first tear if we march even if we win the lannisters hold sansa and father theyll kill them wont they they want us to think so you mean theyre lying i do not know robb what i do know is that you have no choice if you go to kings landing and swear fealty you will never be allowed to leave if you turn your tail and retreat to winterfell your lords will lose all respect for you some may even go over to the lannisters then the queen with that much less to fear can do as she likes with her prisoners our best hope our only true hope is that you can defeat the foe in the field if you should chance to take lord tywin or the kingslayer captive why then a trade might very well be possible but that is not the heart of it so long as you have power enough that they must fear you ned and your sister should be safe cersei is wise enough to know that she may need them to make her peace should the fighting go against her what if the fighting doesnt go against her robb asked what if it goes against us page catelyn took his hand robb i will not soften the truth for you if you lose there is no hope for any of us they say there is naught but stone at the heart of casterly rock remember the fate of rhaegars children she saw the fear in his young eyes then but there was a strength as well then i will not lose he vowed tell me what you know of the fighting in the riverlands she said she had to learn if he was truly ready less than a fortnight past they fought a battle in the hills below the golden tooth robb said uncle edmure had sent lord vance and lord piper to hold the pass but the kingslayer descended on them and put them to flight lord vance was slain the last word we had was that lord piper was falling back to join your brother and his other bannermen at riverrun with jaime lannister on his heels thats not the worst of it though all the time they were battling in the pass lord tywin was bringing a second lannister army around from the south its said to be even larger than jaimes host father must have known that because he sent out some men to oppose them under the kings own banner he gave the command to some southron lordling lord erik or derik or something like that but ser raymun darry rode with him and the letter said there were other knights as well and a force of fathers own guardsmen only it was a trap lord derik had no sooner crossed the red fork than the lannisters fell upon him the kings banner be damned and gregor clegane took them in the rear as they tried to pull back across the mummers ford this lord derik and a few others may have escaped no one is certain but ser raymun was killed and most of our men from winterfell lord tywin has closed off the kingsroad its said and now hes marching north toward harrenhal burning as he goes grim and grimmer thought catelyn it was worse than shed imagined you mean to meet him here she asked if he comes so far but no one thinks he will robb said ive sent word to howland reed fathers old friend at greywater watch if the lannisters come up the neck the crannogmen will bleed them every step of the way but galbart glover says lord tywin is too smart for that and roose bolton agrees hell stay close to the trident they believe taking the castles of the river lords one by one until riverrun stands alone we need to march south to meet him the very idea of it chilled catelyn to the bone what chance would a fifteenyearold boy have against seasoned battle commanders like jaime and tywin lannister is that wise you are strongly placed here its said that the old kings in the north could stand at moat cailin and throw back hosts ten times the size of their own yes but our food and supplies are running low and this is not land we can live off easily weve been waiting for lord manderly but now that his sons have joined us we need to march she was hearing the lords bannermen speaking with her sons voice she realized over the years she had hosted many of them at winterfell and been welcomed with ned to their own hearths and tables she knew what sorts of men they were each one she wondered if robb did and yet there was sense in what they said this host her son had assembled was not a standing army page such as the free cities were accustomed to maintain nor a force of guardsmen paid in coin most of them were smallfolk crofters fieldhands fishermen sheepherders the sons of innkeeps and traders and tanners leavened with a smattering of sellswords and freeriders hungry for plunder when their lords called they came but not forever marching is all very well she said to her son but where and to what purpose what do you mean to do robb hesitated the greatjon thinks we should take the battle to lord tywin and surprise him he said but the glovers and the karstarks feel wed be wiser to go around his army and join up with uncle ser edmure against the kingslayer he ran his fingers through his shaggy mane of auburn hair looking unhappy though by the time we reach riverrun im not certain be certain catelyn told her son or go home and take up that wooden sword again you cannot afford to seem indecisive in front of men like roose bolton and rickard karstark make no mistake robbthese are your bannermen not your friends you named yourself battle commander command her son looked at her startled as if he could not credit what he was hearing as you say mother ill ask you again what do you mean to do robb drew a map across the table a ragged piece of old leather covered with lines of faded paint one end curled up from being rolled he weighed it down with his dagger both plans have virtues but look if we try to swing around lord tywins host we take the risk of being caught between him and the lingslayer and if we attack him by all reports he has more men than i do and a lot more armored horse the greatjon says that wont matter if we catch him with his breeches down but it seems to me that a man who has fought as many battles as tywin lannister wont be so easily surprised good she said she could hear echoes of ned in his voice as he sat there puzzling over the map tell me more id leave a small force here to hold moat cailin archers mostly and march the rest down the causeway he said but once were below the neck id split our host in two the foot can continue down the kingsroad while our horsemen cross the green fork at the twins he pointed when lord tywin gets word that weve come south hell march north to engage our main host leaving our riders free to hurry down the west bank to riverrun robb sat back not quite daring to smile but pleased with himself and hungry for her praise catelyn frowned down at the map youd put a river between the two parts of your army and between jaime and lord tywin he said eagerly the smile came at last theres no crossing on the green fork above the ruby ford where robert won his crown not until the twins all the way up here and lord frey controls that bridge hes your fathers bannerman isnt that so the late lord frey catelyn thought he is she admitted but my father has never trusted him nor should you i wont robb promised what do you think page she was impressed despite herself he looks like a tully she thought yet hes still his fathers son and ned taught him well which force would you command the horse he answered at once again like his father ned would always take the more dangerous task himself and the other the greatjon is always saying that we should smash lord tywin i thought id give him the honor it was his first misstep but how to make him see it without wounding his fledgling confidence your father once told me that the greatjon was as fearless as any man he had ever known robb grinned grey wind ate two of his fingers and he laughed about it so you agree then your father is not fearless catelyn pointed out he is brave but that is very different her son considered that for a moment the eastern host will be all that stands between lord tywin and winterfell he said thoughtfully well them and whatever few bowmen i leave here at the moat so i dont want someone fearless do it no you want cold cunning i should think not courage roose bolton robb said at once that man scares me then let us pray he will scare tywin lannister as well robb nodded and rolled up the map ill give the commands and assemble an escort to take you home to winterfell catelyn had fought to keep herself strong for neds sake and for this stubborn brave son of theirs she had put despair and fear aside as if they were garments she did not choose to wear but now she saw that she had donned them after all i am not going to winterfell she heard herself say surprised at the sudden rush of tears that blurred her vision my father may be dying behind the walls of riverrun my brother is surrounded by foes i must go to them tyrion chella daughter of cheyk of the black ears had gone ahead to scout and it was she who brought back word of the army at the crossroads by their fires i call them twenty thousand strong she said their banners are red with a golden lion your father bronn asked or my brother jaime tyrion said we shall know soon enough he surveyed his ragged band of page brigands near three hundred stone crows moon brothers black ears and burned men and those just the seed of the army he hoped to grow gunthor son of gurn was raising the other clans even now he wondered what his lord father would make of them in their skins and bits of stolen steel if truth be told he did not know what to make of them himself was he their commander or their captive most of the time it seemed to be a little of both it might be best if i rode down alone he suggested best for tyrion son of tywin said ulf who spoke for the moon brothers shagga glowered a fearsome sight to see shagga son of dolf likes this not shagga will go with the boyman and if the boyman lies shagga will chop off his manhood and feed it to the goats yes tyrion said wearily shagga i give you my word as a lannister i will return why should we trust your word chella was a small hard woman flat as a boy and no fool lowland lords have lied to the clans before you wound me chella tyrion said here i thought we had become such friends but as you will you shall ride with me and shagga and conn for the stone crows ulf for the moon brothers and timett son of timett for the burned men the clansmen exchanged wary looks as he named them the rest shall wait here until i send for you try not to kill and maim each other while im gone he put his heels to his horse and trotted off giving them no choice but to follow or be left behind either was fine with him so long as they did not sit down to talk for a day and a night that was the trouble with the clans they had an absurd notion that every mans voice should be heard in council so they argued about everything endlessly even their women were allowed to speak small wonder that it had been hundreds of years since they last threatened the vale with anything beyond an occasional raid tyrion meant to change that brorm rode with him behind themafter a quick bit of grumblingthe five clansmen followed on their undersize garrons scrawny things that looked like ponies and scrambled up rock walls like goats the stone crows rode together and chella and ulf stayed close as well as the moon brothers and black ears had strong bonds between them timett son of timett rode alone every clan in the mountains of the moon feared the burned men who mortified their flesh with fire to prove their courage and the others said roasted babies at their feasts and even the other burned men feared timett who had put out his own left eye with a whitehot knife when he reached the age of manhood tyrion gathered that it was more customary for a boy to burn off a nipple a finger or if he was truly brave or truly mad an ear timetts fellow burned men were so awed by his choice of an eye that they promptly named him a red hand which seemed to be some sort of a war chief i wonder what their king burned off tyrion said to bronn when he heard the tale grinning the sellsword had tugged at his crotch but even brorm kept a respectful tongue around timett if a man was mad enough to put out his own eye he was unlikely to be gentle to his enemies distant watchers peered down from towers of unmortared stone as the party descended through the foothills and once tyrion saw a raven take wing where the high road twisted between two rocky outcrops they came to the first strong point a low earthen wall four feet high closed off the road and a page dozen crossbowmen manned the heights a game of tfirones tyrion halted his followers out of range and rode to the wall alone who commands here he shouted up the captain was quick to appear and even quicker to give them an escort when he recognized his lords son they trotted past blackened fields and burned holdfasts down to the riverlands and the green fork of the trident tyrion saw no bodies but the air was full of ravens and carrion crows there had been fighting here and recently half a league from the crossroads a barricade of sharpened stakes had been erected manned by pikemen and archers behind the line the camp spread out to the far distance thin fingers of smoke rose from hundreds of cookfires mailed men sat under trees and honed their blades and familiar banners fluttered from staffs thrust into the muddy ground a party of mounted horsemen rode forward to challenge them as they approached the stakes the knight who led them wore silver armor inlaid with amethysts and a striped purpleandsilver cloak his shield bore a unicorn sigil and a spiral horn two feet long jutted up from the brow of his horsehead helm tyrion reined up to greet him ser flement ser flement brax lifted his visor tyrion he said in astonishment my lord we all feared you dead or he looked at the clansmen uncertainly these companions of yours bosom friends and loyal retainers tyrion said where will i find my lord father he has taken the inn at the crossroads for his quarters tyrion laughed the inn at the crossroads perhaps the gods were just after all i will see him at once as you say my lord ser flement wheeled his horse about and shouted commands three rows of stakes were pulled from the ground to make a hole in the line tyrion led his party through lord tywins camp spread over leagues chellas estimate of twenty thousand men could not be far wrong the common men camped out in the open but the knights had thrown up tents and some of the high lords had erected pavilions as large as houses tyrion spied the red ox of the presters lord crakehalls brindled boar the burning tree of marbrand the badger of lydden knights called out to him as he cantered past and menatarms gaped at the clansmen in open astonishment shagga was gaping back beyond a certainty he had never seen so many men horses and weapons in all his days the rest of the mountain brigands did a better job of guarding their faces but tyrion had no doubts that they were full as much in awe better and better the more impressed they were with the power of the lannisters the easier they would be to command the inn and its stables were much as he remembered though little more than tumbled stones and blackened foundations remained where the rest of the village had stood a gibbet had been erected in the yard and the body that swung there was covered with ravens at tyrions approach they took to the air page squawking and flapping their black wings he dismounted and glanced up at what remained of the corpse the birds had eaten her lips and eyes and most of her cheeks baring her stained red teeth in a hideous smile a room a meal and a flagon of wine that was all i asked he reminded her with a sigh of reproach boys emerged hesitantly from the stables to see to their horses shagga did not want to give his up the lad wont steal your mare tyrion assured him he only wants to give her some oats and water and brush out her coat shaggas coat could have used a good brushing too but it would have been less than tactful to mention it you have my word the horse will not be harmed glaring shagga let go his grip on the reins this is the horse of shagga son of dolf he roared at the stableboy if he doesnt give her back chop off his manhood and feed it to the goats tyrion promised provided you can find some a pair of house guards in crimson cloaks and lioncrested helms stood under the inns sign on either side of the door tyrion recognized their captain my father in the common room mlord my men will want meat and mead tyrion told him see that they get it he entered the inn and there was father tywin lannister lord of casterly rock and warden of the west was in his middle fifties yet hard as a man of twenty even seated he was tall with long legs broad shoulders a flat stomach his thin arms were corded with muscle when his oncethick golden hair had begun to recede he had commanded his barber to shave his head lord tywin did not believe in half measures he razored his lip and chin as well but kept his sidewhiskers two great thickets of wiry golden hair that covered most of his cheeks from ear to jaw his eyes were a pale green flecked with gold a fool more foolish than most had once jested that even lord tywins shit was flecked with gold some said the man was still alive deep in the bowels of casterly rock ser kevan lannister his fathers only surviving brother was sharing a flagon of ale with lord tywin when tyrion entered the common room his uncle was portly and balding with a closecropped yellow beard that followed the line of his massive jaw ser kevan saw him first tyrion he said in surprise uncle tyrion said bowing and my lord father what a pleasure to find you here lord tywin did not stir from his chair but he did give his dwarf son a long searching look i see that the rumors of your demise were unfounded sorry to disappoint you father tyrion said no need to leap up and embrace me i wouldnt want you to strain yourself he crossed the room to their table acutely conscious of the way his stunted legs made him waddle with every step whenever his fathers eyes were on him he became uncomfortably aware of all his deformities and shortcomings kind of you to go to war for me he said as he climbed into a chair and helped himself to a cup of his fathers ale page by my lights it was you who started this lord tywin replied your brother jaime would never have meekly submitted to capture at the hands of a woman thats one way we differ jaime and hes taller as well you may have noticed his father ignored the sally the honor of our house was at stake i had no choice but to ride no man sheds lannister blood with impunity hear me roar tyrion said grinning the lannister words truth be told none of my blood was actually shed although it was a close thing once or twice morrec and jyck were killed i suppose you will be wanting some new men dont trouble yourself father ive acquired a few of my own he tried a swallow of the ale it was brown and yeasty so thick you could almost chew it very fine in truth a pity his father had hanged the innkeep how is your war going his uncle answered well enough for the nonce ser edmure had scattered small troops of men along his borders to stop our raiding and your lord father and i were able to destroy most of them piecemeal before they could regroup your brother has been covering himself with glory his father said he smashed the lords vance and piper at the golden tooth and met the massed power of the tullys under the walls of riverrun the lords of the trident have been put to rout ser edmure tully was taken captive with many of his knights and bannermen lord blackwood led a few survivors back to riverrun where jaime has them under siege the rest fled to their own strongholds your father and i have been marching on each in turn ser kevan said with lord blackwood gone raventree fell at once and lady whent yielded harrenhal for want of men to defend it ser gregor burnt out the pipers and the brackens leaving you unopposed tyrion said not wholly ser kevan said the mallisters still hold seagard and walder frey is marshaling his levies at the twins no matter lord tywin said frey only takes the field when the scent of victory is in the air and all he smells now is ruin and jason mallister lacks the strength to fight alone once jaime takes riverrun they will both be quick enough to bend the knee unless the starks and the arryns come forth to oppose us this war is good as won i would not fret overmuch about the arryns if i were you tyrion said the starks are another matter lord eddard is our hostage his father said he will lead no armies while he rots in a dungeon under the red keep no ser kevan agreed but his son has called the banners and sits at moat cailin with a strong host page around him no sword is strong until its been tempered lord tywin declared the stark boy is a child no doubt he likes the sound of warhorns well enough and the sight of his banners fluttering in the wind but in the end it comes down to butchers work i doubt he has the stomach for it things had gotten interesting while hed been away tyrion reflected and what is our fearless monarch doing whilst all this butchers work is being done he wondered how has my lovely and persuasive sister gotten robert to agree to the imprisonment of his dear friend ned robert baratheon is dead his father told him your nephew reigns in kings landing that did take tyrion aback my sister you mean he took another gulp of ale the realm would be a much different place with cersei ruling in place of her husband if you have a mind to make yourself of use i will give you a command his father said marq piper and karyl vance are loose in our rear raiding our lands across the red fork tyrion made a tsking sound the gall of them fighting back ordinarily id be glad to punish such rudeness father but the truth is i have pressing business elsewhere do you lord tywin did not seem awed we also have a pair of ned starks afterthoughts making a nuisance of themselves by harassing my foraging parties beric dondarrion some young lordling with delusions of valor he has that fat jape of a priest with him the one who likes to set his sword on fire do you think you might be able to deal with them as you scamper off without making too much a botch of it tyrion wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and smiled father it warms my heart to think that you might entrust me with what twenty men fifty are you sure you can spare so many well no matter if i should come across thoros and lord beric i shall spank them both he climbed down from his chair and waddled to the sideboard where a wheel of veined white cheese sat surrounded by fruit first though i have some promises of my own to keep he said as he sliced off a wedge i shall require three thousand helms and as many hauberks plus swords pikes steel spearheads maces battleaxes gauntlets gorgets greaves breastplates wagons to carry all this the door behind him opened with a crash so violently that tyrion almost dropped his cheese ser kevan leapt up swearing as the captain of the guard went flying across the room to smash against the hearth as he tumbled down into the cold ashes his lion helm askew shagga snapped the mans sword in two over a knee thick as a tree trunk threw down the pieces and lumbered into the common room he was preceded by his stench riper than the cheese and overpowering in the closed space little redcape he snarled when next you bare steel on shagga son of dolf i will chop off your manhood and roast it in the fire what no goats tyrion said taking a bite of cheese the other clansmen followed shagga into the common room bronn with them the sellsword gave tyrion a rueful shrug page who might you be lord tywin asked cool as snow they followed me home father tyrion explained may i keep them they dont eat much no one was smiling by what right do you savages intrude on our councils demanded ser kevan savages lowlander conn might have been handsome if you washed him we are free men and free men by rights sit on all war councils which one is the lion lord chella asked they are both old men announced timett son of timett who had yet to see his twentieth year ser kevans hand went to his sword hilt but his brother placed two fingers on his wrist and held him fast lord tywin seemed unperturbed tyrion have you forgotten your courtesies kindly acquaint us with our honored guests tyrion licked his fingers with pleasure he said the fair maid is chella daughter of cheyk of the black ears im no maid chella protested my sons have taken fifty ears among them may they take fifty more tyrion waddled away from her this is conn son of coratt shagga son of dolf is the one who looks like casterly rock with hair they are stone crows here is ulf son of umar of the moon brothers and here timett son of timett a red hand of the burned men and this is bronn a sellsword of no particular allegiance he has already changed sides twice in the short time ive known him you and he ought to get on famously father to bronn and the clansmen he said may i present my lord father tywin son of tytos of house lannister lord of casterly rock warden of the west shield of lannisport and once and future hand of the king lord tywin rose dignified and correct even in the west we know the prowess of the warrior clans of the mountains of the moon what brings you down from your strongholds my lords horses said shagga a promise of silk and steel said timett son of timett tyrion was about to tell his lord father how he proposed to reduce the vale of arryn to a smoking wasteland but he was never given the chance the door banged open again the messenger gave tyrions clansmen a quick queer look as he dropped to one knee before lord tywin my lord he said ser addam bid me tell you that the stark host is moving down the causeway lord tywin lannister did not smile lord tywin never smiled but tyrion had learned to read his fathers pleasure all the same and it was there on his face so the wolfling is leaving his den to play among the lions he said in a voice of quiet satisfaction splendid return to ser addam and tell him to fall back he is not to engage the northerners until we arrive but i want him to harass their flanks and draw them farther south it will be as you command the rider took his leave page we are well situated here ser kevan pointed out close to the ford and ringed by pits and spikes if they are coming south i say let them come and break themselves against us the boy may hang back or lose his courage when he sees our numbers lord tywin replied the sooner the starks are broken the sooner i shall be free to deal with stannis baratheon tell the drummers to beat assembly and send word to jaime that i am marching against robb stark as you will ser kevan said tyrion watched with a grim fascination as his lord father turned next to the halfwild clansmen it is said that the men of the mountain clans are warriors without fear it is said truly conn of the stone crows answered and the women chella added ride with me against my enemies and you shall have all my son promised you and more lord tywin told them would you pay us with our own coin ulf son of umar said why should we need the fathers promise when we have the sons i said nothing of need lord tywin replied my words were courtesy nothing more you need not join us the men of the winterlands are made of iron and ice and even my boldest knights fear to face them oh deftly done tyrion thought smiling crookedly the burned men fear nothing timett son of timett will ride with the lions wherever the burned men go the stone crows have been there first conn declared hotly we ride as well shagga son of dolf will chop off their manhoods and feed them to the crows we will ride with you lion lord chella daughter of cheyk agreed but only if your halfman son goes with us he has bought his breath with promises until we hold the steel he has pledged us his life is ours lord tywin turned his goldflecked eyes on his son joy tyrion said with a resigned smile sansa the walls of the throne room had been stripped bare the hunting tapestries that king robert loved page taken down and stacked in the corner in an untidy heap ser mandon moore went to take his place under the throne beside two of his fellows of the kingsguard sansa hovered by the door for once unguarded the queen had given her freedom of the castle as a reward for being good yet even so she was escorted everywhere she went honor guards for my daughtertobe the queen called them but they did not make sansa feel honored freedom of the castle meant that she could go wherever she chose within the red keep so long as she promised not to go beyond the walls a promise sansa had been more than willing to give she couldnt have gone beyond the walls anyway the gates were watched day and night by janos slynts gold cloaks and lannister house guards were always about as well besides even if she could leave the castle where would she go it was enough that she could walk in the yard pick flowers in myrcellas garden and visit the sept to pray for her father sometimes she prayed in the godswood as well since the starks kept the old gods this was the first court session of joffreys reign so sansa looked about nervously a line of lannister house guards stood beneath the western windows a line of goldcloaked city watchmen beneath the east of smallfolk and commoners she saw no sign but under the gallery a cluster of lords great and small milled restlessly there were no more than twenty where a hundred had been accustomed to wait upon king robert sansa slipped in among them murmuring greetings as she worked her way toward the front she recognized blackskinned jalabhar xho gloomy ser aron santagar the redwyne twins horror and slobber only none of them seemed to recognize her or if they did they shied away as if she had the grey plague sickly lord gyles covered his face at her approach and feigned a fit of coughing and when funny drunken ser dontos started to hail her ser balon swann whispered in his ear and he turned away and so many others were missing where had the rest of them gone sansa wondered vainly she searched for friendly faces not one of them would meet her eyes it was as if she had become a ghost dead before her time grand maester pycelle was seated alone at the council table seemingly asleep his hands clasped together atop his beard she saw lord varys hurry into the hall his feet making no sound a moment later lord baelish entered through the tall doors in the rear smiling he chatted amiably with ser balon and ser dontos as he made his way to the front butterflies fluttered nervously in sansas stomach i shouldnt be afraid she told herself i have nothing to be afraid of it will all come out well joff loves me and the queen does too she said so a heralds voice rang out all hail his grace joffrey of the houses baratheon and lannister the first of his name king of the andals the rhoynar and the first men and lord of the seven kingdoms all hail his lady mother cersei of house lannister queen regent light of the west and protector of the realm ser barristan selmy resplendent in white plate led them in ser arys oakheart escorted the queen while ser boros blount walked beside joffrey so six of the kingsguard were now in the hall all the white swords save jaime lannister alone her princeno her king nowtook the steps of the iron throne two at a time while his mother was seated with the council joff wore plush black velvets slashed with crimson a shimmering clothofgold cape with a high collar and on his head a golden crown crusted page with rubies and black diamonds when joffrey turned to look out over the hall his eye caught sansas he smiled seated himself and spoke it is a kings duty to punish the disloyal and reward those who are true grand maester pycelle i command you to read my decrees pycelle pushed himself to his feet he was clad in a magnificent robe of thick red velvet with an ermine collar and shiny gold fastenings from a drooping sleeve heavy with gilded scrollwork he drew a parchment unrolled it and began to read a long list of names commanding each in the name of king and council to present themselves and swear their fealty to joffrey failing that they would be adjudged traitors their lands and titles forfeit to the throne the names he read made sansa hold her breath lord stannis baratheon his lady wife his daughter lord renly baratheon both lord royces and their sons ser loras tyrell lord mace tyrell his brothers uncles sons the red priest thoros of myr lord beric dondarrion lady lysa arryn and her son the little lord robert lord hoster tully his brother ser brynden his son ser edmure lord jason mallister lord bryce caron of the marches lord tytos blackwood lord walder frey and his heir ser stevron lord karyl vance lord jonos bracken lady sheila whent doran martell prince of dorne and all his sons so many she thought as pycelle read on and on it will take a whole flock of ravens to send out these commands and at the end near last came the names sansa had been dreading lady catelyn stark robb stark brandon stark rickon stark arya stark sansa stifled a gasp arya they wanted arya to present herself and swear an oath it must mean her sister had fled on the galley she must be safe at winterfell by now grand maester pycelle rolled up the list tucked it up his left sleeve and pulled another parchment from his right he cleared his throat and resumed in the place of the traitor eddard stark it is the wish of his grace that tywin lannister lord of casterly rock and warden of the west take up the office of hand of the king to speak with his voice lead his armies against his enemies and carry out his royal will so the king has decreed the small council consents in the place of the traitor stannis baratheon it is the wish of his grace that his lady mother the queen regent cersei lannister who has ever been his staunchest support be seated upon his small council that she may help him rule wisely and with justice so the king has decreed the small council consents sansa heard a soft murmuring from the lords around her but it was quickly stilled pycelle continued it is also the wish of his grace that his loyal servant janos slynt commander of the city watch of kings landing be at once raised to the rank of lord and granted the ancient seat of harrenhal with all its attendant lands and incomes and that his sons and grandsons shall hold these honors after him until the end of time it is moreover his command that lord slynt be seated immediately upon his small council to assist in the governance of the realm so the king has decreed the small council consents sansa glimpsed motion from the corner of her eye as janos slynt made his entrance this time the page muttering was louder and angrier proud lords whose houses went back thousands of years made way reluctantly for the balding frogfaced commoner as he marched past golden scales had been sewn onto the black velvet of his doublet and rang together softly with each step his cloak was checked blackandgold satin two ugly boys who must have been his sons went before him struggling with the weight of a heavy metal shield as tall as they were for his sigil he had taken a bloody spear gold on a nightblack field the sight of it raised goose prickles up and down sansas arms as lord slynt took his place grand maester pycelle resumed lastly in these times of treason and turmoil with our beloved robert so lately dead it is the view of the council that the life and safety of king joffrey is of paramount importance he looked to the queen cersei stood ser barristan selmy stand forth ser barristan had been standing at the foot of the iron throne as still as any statue but now he went to one knee and bowed his head your grace i am yours to command rise ser barristan cersei lannister said you may remove your helm my lady standing the old knight took off his high white helm though he did not seem to understand why you have served the realm long and faithfully good ser and every man and woman in the seven kingdoms owes you thanks yet now i fear your service is at an end it is the wish of king and council that you lay down your heavy burden my burden i fear i i do not the newmade lord janos slynt spoke up his voice heavy and blunt her grace is trying to tell you that you are relieved as lord commander of the kingsguard the tall whitehaired knight seemed to shrink as he stood there scarcely breathing your grace he said at last the kingsguard is a sworn brotherhood our vows are taken for life only death may relieve the lord commander of his sacred trust whose death ser barristan the queens voice was soft as silk but her words carried the whole length of the hall yours or your kings you let my father die joffrey said accusingly from atop the iron throne youre too old to protect anybody sansa watched as the knight peered up at his new king she had never seen him look his years before yet now he did your grace he said i was chosen for the white swords in my twentythird year it was all i had ever dreamed from the moment i first took sword in hand i gave up all claim to my ancestral keep the girl i was to wed married my cousin in my place i had no need of land or sons my life would be lived for the realm ser gerold hightower himself heard my vows to ward the king with all my strength to give my blood for his i fought beside the white bull and prince lewyn of dorne beside ser arthur dayne the sword of the morning before i served your father i helped shield king aerys and his father jaehaerys before him three kings page and all of them dead littlefinger pointed out your time is done cersei lannister announced joffrey requires men around him who are young and strong the council has determined that ser jaime lannister will take your place as the lord commander of sworn brothers of the white swords the kingslayer ser barristan said his voice hard with contempt the false knight who profaned his blade with the blood of the king he had sworn to defend have a care for your words ser the queen warned you are speaking of our beloved brother your kings own blood lord varys spoke gentler than the others we are not unmindful of your service good ser lord tywin lannister has generously agreed to grant you a handsome tract of land north of lannisport beside the sea with gold and men sufficient to build you a stout keep and servants to see to your every need ser barristan looked up sharply a hall to die in and men to bury me i thank you my lords but i spit upon your pity he reached up and undid the clasps that held his cloak in place and the heavy white garment slithered from his shoulders to fall in a heap on the floor his helmet dropped with a clang i am a knight he told them he opened the silver fastenings of his breastplate and let that fall as well i shall die a knight a naked knight it would seem quipped littlefinger they all laughed then joffrey on his throne and the lords standing attendance janos slynt and queen cersei and sandor clegane and even the other men of the kingsguard the five who had been his brothers until a moment ago surely that must have hurt the most sansa thought her heart went out to the gallant old man as he stood shamed and redfaced too angry to speak finally he drew his sword sansa heard someone gasp ser boros and ser meryn moved forward to confront him but ser barristan froze them in place with a look that dripped contempt have no fear sers your king is safe no thanks to you even now i could cut through the five of you as easy as a dagger cuts cheese if you would serve under the kingslayer not a one of you is fit to wear the white he flung his sword at the foot of the iron throne here boy melt it down and add it to the others if you like it will do you more good than the swords in the hands of these five perhaps lord stannis will chance to sit on it when he takes your throne he took the long way out his steps ringing loud against the floor and echoing off the bare stone walls lords and ladies parted to let him pass not until the pages had closed the great oakandbronze doors behind him did sansa hear sounds again soft voices uneasy stirrings the shuffle of papers from the council table he called me boy joffrey said peevishly sounding younger than his years he talked about my uncle stannis too idle talk said varys the eunuch without meaning he could be making plots with my uncles i want him seized and questioned no one moved joffrey raised his voice i said i want him seized page janos slynt rose from the council table my gold cloaks will see to it your grace good said king joffrey lord janos strode from the hall his ugly sons doublestepping to keep up as they lugged the great metal shield with the arms of house slynt your grace littlefinger reminded the king if we might resume the seven are now six we find ourselves in need of a new sword for your kingsguard joffrey smiled tell them mother the king and council have determined that no man in the seven kingdoms is more fit to guard and protect his grace than his sworn shield sandor clegane how do you like that dog king joffrey asked the hounds scarred face was hard to read he took a long moment to consider why not i have no lands nor wife to forsake and whod care if i did the burned side of his mouth twisted but i warn you ill say no knights vows the sworn brothers of the kingsguard have always been knights ser boros said firmly until now the hound said in his deep rasp and ser boros fell silent when the kings herald moved forward sansa realized the moment was almost at hand she smoothed down the cloth of her skirt nervously she was dressed in mourning as a sign of respect for the dead king but she had taken special care to make herself beautiful her gown was the ivory silk that the queen had given her the one arya had ruined but shed had them dye it black and you couldnt see the stain at all she had fretted over her jewelry for hours and finally decided upon the elegant simplicity of a plain silver chain the heralds voice boomed out if any man in this hall has other matters to set before his grace let him speak now or go forth and hold his silence sansa quailed now she told herself i must do it now gods give me courage she took one step then another lords and knights stepped aside silently to let her pass and she felt the weight of their eyes on her i must be as strong as my lady mother your grace she called out in a soft tremulous voice the height of the iron throne gave joffrey a better vantage point than anyone else in the hall he was the first to see her come forward my lady he called out smiling his smile emboldened her made her feel beautiful and strong he does love me he does sansa lifted her head and walked toward him not too slow and not too fast she must not let them see how nervous she was the lady sansa of house stark the herald cried she stopped under the throne at the spot where ser barristans white cloak lay puddled on the floor beside his helm and breastplate do you have some business for king and council sansa the queen page asked from the council table i do she knelt on the cloak so as not to spoil her gown and looked up at her prince on his fearsome black throne as it please your grace i ask mercy for my father lord eddard stark who was the hand of the king she had practiced the words a hundred times the queen sighed sansa you disappoint me what did i tell you about traitors blood your father has committed grave and terrible crimes my lady grand maester pycelle intoned ah poor sad thing sighed varys she is only a babe my lords she does not know what she asks sansa had eyes only for joffrey he must listen to me he must she thought the king shifted on his seat let her speak he commanded i want to hear what she says thank you your grace sansa smiled a shy secret smile just for him he was listening she knew he would treason is a noxious weed pycelle declared solemnly it must be torn up root and stem and seed lest new traitors sprout from every roadside do you deny your fathers crime lord baelish asked no my lords sansa knew better than that i know he must be punished all i ask is mercy i know my lord father must regret what he did he was king roberts friend and he loved him you all know he loved him he never wanted to be hand until the king asked him they must have lied to him lord renly or lord stannis or or somebody they must have lied otherwise king joffrey leaned forward hands grasping the arms of the throne broken sword points fanned out between his fingers he said i wasnt the king why did he say that his leg was broken sansa replied eagerly it hurt ever so much maester pycelle was giving him milk of the poppy and they say that milk of the poppy fills your head with clouds otherwise he would never have said it varys said a childsfaith such sweet innocence and yet they say wisdom oft comes from the mouths of babes treason is treason pycelle replied at once joffrey rocked restlessly on the throne mother cersei lannister considered sansa thoughtfully if lord eddard were to confess his crime she said at last we would know he had repented his folly joffrey pushed himself to his feet please sansa thought please please be the king i know you are good and kind and noble please do you have any more to say he asked her page only that as you love me you do me this kindness my prince sansa said king joffrey looked her up and down your sweet words have moved me he said gallantly nodding as if to say all would be well i shall do as you ask but first your father has to confess he has to confess and say that im the king or there will be no mercy for him he will sansa said heart soaring oh i know he will eddard the straw on the floor stank of urine there was no window no bed not even a slop bucket he remembered walls of pale red stone festooned with patches of nitre a grey door of splintered wood four inches thick and studded with iron he had seen them briefly a quick glimpse as they shoved him inside once the door had slammed shut he had seen no more the dark was absolute he had as well been blind or dead buried with his king ah robert he murmured as his groping hand touched a cold stone wall his leg throbbing with every motion he remembered the jest the king had shared in the crypts of winterfell as the kings of winter looked on with cold stone eyes the king eats robert had said and the hand takes the shit how he had laughed yet he had gotten it wrong the king dies ned stark thought and the hand is buried the dungeon was under the red keep deeper than he dared imagine he remembered the old stories about maegor the cruel who murdered all the masons who labored on his castle so they might never reveal its secrets he damned them all littlefinger janos slynt and his gold cloaks the queen the kingslayer pycelle and varys and ser barristan even lord renly roberts own blood who had run when he was needed most yet in the end he blamed himself fool he cried to the darkness thricedamned blind fool cersei lannisters face seemed to float before him in the darkness her hair was full of sunlight but there was mockery in her smile when you play the game of thrones you win or you die she whispered ned had played and lost and his men had paid the price of his folly with their lifes blood when he thought of his daughters he would have wept gladly but the tears would not come even now he was a stark of winterfell and his grief and his rage froze hard inside him when he kept very still his leg did not hurt so much so he did his best to lie unmoving for how long he could not say there was no sun and no moon he could not see to mark the walls ned closed his eyes and opened them it made no difference he slept and woke and slept again he did not know which was more painful the waking or the sleeping when he slept he dreamed dark disturbing dreams of blood and broken promises when he woke there was nothing to do but think and his waking thoughts were worse than nightmares the thought of cat was as painful as a bed of nettles he wondered where she was what she was doing he wondered whether he would ever see her again hours turned to days or so it seemed he could feel a dull ache in his shattered leg an itch beneath the page plaster when he touched his thigh the flesh was hot to his fingers the only sound was his breathing after a time he began to talk aloud just to hear a voice he made plans to keep himself sane built castles of hope in the dark roberts brothers were out in the world raising armies at dragonstone and storms end alyn and harwin would return to kings landing with the rest of his household guard once they had dealt with ser gregor catelyn would raise the north when the word reached her and the lords of river and mountain and vale would join her he found himself thinking of robert more and more he saw the king as he had been in the flower of his youth tall and handsome his great antlered helm on his head his warhammer in hand sitting his horse like a horned god he heard his laughter in the dark saw his eyes blue and clear as mountain lakes look at us ned robert said gods how did we come to this you here and me killed by a pig we won a throne together ifailed you robert ned thought he could not say the words i lied to you hid the truth i let them kill you the king heard him you stiffnecked fool he muttered too proud to listen can you eat pride stark will honor shield your children cracks ran down his face fissures opening in the flesh and he reached up and ripped the mask away it was not robert at all it was littlefinger grinning mocking him when he opened his mouth to speak his lies turned to pale grey moths and took wing ned was halfasleep when the footsteps came down the hall at first he thought he dreamt them it had been so long since he had heard anything but the sound of his own voice ned was feverish by then his leg a dull agony his lips parched and cracked when the heavy wooden door creaked open the sudden light was painful to his eyes a gaoler thrust a jug at him the clay was cool and beaded with moisture ned grasped it with both hands and gulped eagerly water ran from his mouth and dripped down through his beard he drank until he thought he would be sick how long t he asked weakly when he could drink no more the gaoler was a scarecrow of a man with a rats face and frayed beard clad in a mail shirt and a leather half cape no talking he said as he wrenched the jug from neds hands please ned said my daughters the door crashed shut he blinked as the light vanished lowered his head to his chest and curled up on the straw it no longer stank of urine and shit it no longer smelled at all he could no longer tell the difference between waking and sleeping the memory came creeping upon him in the darkness as vivid as a dream it was the year of false spring and he was eighteen again down from the eyrie to the tourney at harrenhal he could see the deep green of the grass and smell the pollen on the wind warm days and cool nights and the sweet taste of wine he remembered brandons laughter and roberts berserk valor in the melee the way he laughed as he unhorsed men left and right he remembered jaime lannister a golden youth in scaled white armor kneeling on the grass in front of the kings pavilion and making his vows to protect and defend king aerys afterward ser oswell whent helped jaime to his feet and the white bull himself lord commander ser gerold hightower fastened the snowy cloak of the kingsguard about his shoulders all six white swords were there to welcome their newest brother page yet when the jousting began the day belonged to rhaegar targaryen the crown prince wore the armor he would die in gleaming black plate with the threeheaded dragon of his house wrought in rubies on the breast a plume of scarlet silk streamed behind him when he rode and it seemed no lance could touch him brandon fell to him and bronze yohn royce and even the splendid ser arthur dayne the sword of the morning robert had been jesting with jon and old lord hunter as the prince circled the field after unhorsing ser barristan in the final tilt to claim the champions crown ned remembered the moment when all the smiles died when prince rhaegar targaryen urged his horse past his own wife the dornish princess elia martell to lay the queen of beautys laurel in lyannas lap he could see it still a crown of winter roses blue as frost ned stark reached out his hand to grasp the flowery crown but beneath the pale blue petals the thorns lay hidden he felt them clawing at his skin sharp and cruel saw the slow trickle of blood run down his fingers and woke trembling in the dark promise me ned his sister had whispered from her bed of blood she had loved the scent of winter roses gods save me ned wept i am going mad the gods did not deign to answer each time the turnkey brought him water he told himself another day had passed at first he would beg the man for some word of his daughters and the world beyond his cell grunts and kicks were his only replies later when the stomach cramps began he begged for food instead it made no matter he was not fed perhaps the lannisters meant for him to starve to death no he told himself if cersei had wanted him dead he would have been cut down in the throne room with his men she wanted him alive weak desperate yet alive catelyn held her brother she dare not kill him or the imps life would be forfeit as well from outside his cell came the rattle of iron chains as the door creaked open ned put a hand to the damp wall and pushed himself toward the light the glare of a torch made him squint food he croaked wine a voice answered it was not the ratfaced man this gaoler was stouter shorter though he wore the same leather half cape and spiked steel cap drink lord eddard he thrust a wineskin into neds hands the voice was strangely familiar yet it took ned stark a moment to place it varys he said groggily when it came he touched the mans face im not not dreaming this youre here the eunuchs plump cheeks were covered with a dark stubble of beard ned felt the coarse hair with his fingers varys had transformed himself into a grizzled turnkey reeking of sweat and sour wine how did you what sort of magician are you a thirsty one varys said drink my lord page neds hands fumbled at the skin is this the same poison they gave robert you wrong me varys said sadly truly no one loves a eunuch give me the skin he drank a trickle of red leaking from the corner of his plump mouth not the equal of the vintage you offered me the night of the tourney but no more poisonous than most he concluded wiping his lips here ned tried a swallow dregs he felt as though he were about to bring the wine back up all men must swallow the sour with the sweet high lords and eunuchs alike your hour has come my lord my daughters the younger girl escaped ser meryn and fled varys told him i have not been able to find her nor have the lannisters a kindness there our new king loves her not your older girl is still betrothed to joffrey cersei keeps her close she came to court a few days ago to plead that you be spared a pity you couldnt have been there you would have been touched he leaned forward intently i trust you realize that you are a dead man lord eddard the queen will not kill me ned said his head swam the wine was strong and it had been too long since hed eaten cat cat holds her brother the wrong brother varys sighed and lost to her in any case she let the imp slip through her fingers i expect he is dead by now somewhere in the mountains of the moon if that is true slit my throat and have done with it he was dizzy from the wine tired and heartsick your blood is the last thing i desire ned frowned when they slaughtered my guard you stood beside the queen and watched and said not a word and would again i seem to recall that i was unarmed unarmored and surrounded by lannister swords the eunuch looked at him curiously tilting his head when i was a young boy before i was cut i traveled with a troupe of mummers through the free cities they taught me that each man has a role to play in life as well as mummery so it is at court the kings justice must be fearsome the master of coin must be frugal the lord commander of the kingsguard must be valiant and the master of whisperers must be sly and obsequious and without scruple a courageous informer would be as useless as a cowardly knight he took the wineskin back and drank ned studied the eunuchs face searching for truth beneath the mummers scars and false stubble he tried some more wine this time it went down easier can you free me from this pit i could but will i no questions would be asked and the answers would lead back to me ned had expected no more you are blunt page a eunuch has no honor and a spider does not enjoy the luxury of scruples my lord would you at least consent to carry a message out for me that would depend on the message i will gladly provide you with paper and ink if you like and when you have written what you will i will take the letter and read it and deliver it or not as best serves my own ends your own ends what ends are those lord varys peace varys replied without hesitation if there was one soul in kings landing who was truly desperate to keep robert baratheon alive it was me he sighed for fifteen years i protected him from his enemies but i could not protect him from his friends what strange fit of madness led you to tell the queen that you had learned the truth of joffreys birth the madness of mercy ned admitted ah said varys to be sure you are an honest and honorable man lord eddard ofttimes i forget that i have met so few of them in my life he glanced around the cell when i see what honesty and honor have won you i understand why ned stark laid his head back against the damp stone wall and closed his eyes his leg was throbbing the kings wine did you question lancel oh indeed cersei gave him the wineskins and told him it was roberts favorite vintage the eunuch shrugged a hunter lives a perilous life if the boar had not done for robert it would have been a fall from a horse the bite of a wood adder an arrow gone astray the forest is the abbatoir of the gods it was not wine that killed the king it was your mercy ned had feared as much gods forgive me if there are gods varys said i expect they will the queen would not have waited long in any case robert was becoming unruly and she needed to be rid of him to free her hands to deal with his brothers they are quite a pair stannis and renly the iron gauntlet and the silk glove he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand you have been foolish my lord you ought to have heeded littlefinger when he urged you to support joffreys succession how how could you know of that varys smiled i know thats all that need concern you i also know that on the morrow the queen will pay you a visit slowly ned raised his eyes why cersei is frightened of you my lord but she has other enemies she fears even more her beloved jaime is fighting the river lords even now lysa arryn sits in the eyrie ringed in stone and steel and there is no love lost between her and the queen in dorne the martells still brood on the murder of princess elia and her babes and now your son marches down the neck with a northern host at his back page robb is only a boy ned said aghast a boy with an army varys said yet only a boy as you say the kings brothers are the ones giving cersei sleepless nights lord stannis in particular his claim is the true one he is known for his prowess as a battle commander and he is utterly without mercy there is no creature on earth half so terrifying as a truly just man no one knows what stannis has been doing on dragonstone but i will wager you that hes gathered more swords than seashells so here is cerseis nightmare while her father and brother spend their power battling starks and tullys lord stannis will land proclaim himself king and lop off her sons curly blond head and her own in the bargain though i truly believe she cares more about the boy stannis baratheon is roberts true heir ned said the throne is his by rights i would welcome his ascent varys tsked cersei will not want to hear that i promise you stannis may win the throne but only your rotting head will remain to cheer unless you guard that tongue of yours sansa begged so sweetly it would be a shame if you threw it all away you are being given your life back if youll take it cersei is no fool she knows a tame wolf is of more use than a dead one you want me to serve the woman who murdered my king butchered my men and crippled my son neds voice was thick with disbelief i want you to serve the realm varys said tell the queen that you will confess your vile treason command your son to lay down his sword and proclaim joffrey as the true heir offer to denounce stannis and renly as faithless usurpers our greeneyed lioness knows you are a man of honor if you will give her the peace she needs and the time to deal with stannis and pledge to carry her secret to your grave i believe she will allow you to take the black and live out the rest of your days on the wall with your brother and that baseborn son of yours the thought of jon filled ned with a sense of shame and a sorrow too deep for words if only he could see the boy again sit and talk with him pain shot through his broken leg beneath the filthy grey plaster of his cast he winced his fingers opening and closing helplessly is this your own scheme he gasped out at varys or are you in league with littlefinger that seemed to amuse the eunuch i would sooner wed the black goat of qohor littlefinger is the second most devious man in the seven kingdoms oh i feed him choice whispers sufficient so that he thinks i am his just as i allow cersei to believe i am hers and just as you let me believe that you were mine tell me lord varys who do you truly serve varys smiled thinly why the realm my good lord how ever could you doubt that i swear it by my lost manhood i serve the realm and the realm needs peace he finished the last swallow of wine and tossed the empty skin aside so what is your answer lord eddard give me your word that youll tell the queen what she wants to hear when she comes calling if i did my word would be as hollow as an empty suit of armor my life is not so precious to me as that page pity the eunuch stood and your daughters life my lord how precious is that a chill pierced neds heart my daughter surely you did not think id forgotten about your sweet innocent my lord the queen most certainly has not no ned pleaded his voice cracking varys gods have mercy do as you like with me but leave my daughter out of your schemes sansas no more than a child rhaenys was a child too prince rhaegars daughter a precious little thing younger than your girls she had a small black kitten she called balerion did you know i always wondered what happened to him rhaenys liked to pretend he was the true balerion the black dread of old but i imagine the lannisters taught her the difference between a kitten and a dragon quick enough the day they broke down her door varys gave a long weary sigh the sigh of a man who carried all the sadness of the world in a sack upon his shoulders the high septon once told me that as we sin so do we suffer if thats true lord eddard tell me why is it always the innocents who suffer most when you high lords play your game of thrones ponder it if you would while you wait upon the queen and spare a thought for this as well the next visitor who calls on you could bring you bread and cheese and the milk of the poppy for your pain or he could bring you sansas head the choice my dear lord hand is entirely yours catelyn as the host trooped down the causeway through the black bogs of the neck and spilled out into the riverlands beyond catelyns apprehensions grew she masked her fears behind a face kept still and stern yet they were there all the same growing with every league they crossed her days were anxious her nights restless and every raven that flew overhead made her clench her teeth she feared for her lord father and wondered at his ominous silence she feared for her brother edmure and prayed that the gods would watch over him if he must face the kingslayer in battle she feared for ned and her girls and for the sweet sons she had left behind at winterfell and yet there was nothing she could do for any of them and so she made herself put all thought of them aside you must save your strength for robb she told herself he is the only one you can help you must be as fierce and hard as the north catelyn tully you must be a stark for true now like your son robb rode at the front of the column beneath the flapping white banner of winterfell each day he would ask one of his lords to join him so they might confer as they marched he honored every man in turn showing no favorites listening as his lord father had listened weighing the words of one against the other he has learned so much from ned she thought as she watched him but has he learned enough the blackfish had taken a hundred picked men and a hundred swift horses and raced ahead to screen their movements and scout the way the reports ser bryndens riders brought back did little to reassure her lord tywins host was still many days to the south but walder page frey lord of the crossing had assembled a force of near four thousand men at his castles on the green fork late again catelyn murmured when she heard it was the trident all over damn the man her brother edmure had called the banners by rights lord frey should have gone to join the tully host at riverrun yet here he sat four thousand men robb repeated more perplexed than angry lord frey cannot hope to fight the lannisters by himself surely he means to join his power to ours does he catelyn asked she had ridden forward to join robb and robett glover his companion of the day the vanguard spread out behind them a slowmoving forest of lances and banners and spears i wonder expect nothing of walder frey and you will never be surprised hes your fathers bannerman some men take their oaths more seriously than others robb and lord walder was always friendlier with casterly rock than my father would have liked one of his sons is wed to tywin lannisters sister that means little of itself to be sure lord walder has sired a great many children over the years and they must needs marry someone still do you think he means to betray us to the lannisters my lady robett glover asked gravely catelyn sighed if truth be told i doubt even lord frey knows what lord frey intends to do he has an old mans caution and a young mans ambition and has never lacked for cunning we must have the twins mother robb said heatedly there is no other way across the river you know that yes and so does walder frey you can be sure of that that night they made camp on the southern edge of the bogs halfway between the kingsroad and the river it was there theon greyjoy brought them further word from her uncle ser brynden says to tell you hes crossed swords with the lannisters there are a dozen scouts who wont be reporting back to lord tywin anytime soon or ever he grinned ser addam marbrand commands their outriders and hes pulling back south burning as he goes he knows where we are more or less but the blackfish vows he will not know when we split unless lord frey tells him catelyn said sharply theon when you return to my uncle tell him he is to place his best bowmen around the twins day and night with orders to bring down any raven they see leaving the battlements i want no birds bringing word of my sons movements to lord tywin ser brynden has seen to it already my lady theon replied with a cocky smile a few more blackbirds and we should have enough to bake a pie ill save you their feathers for a hat she ought to have known that brynden blackfish would be well ahead of her what have the freys been doing while the lannisters burn their fields and plunder their holdfasts page theres been some fighting between ser addams men and lord walders theon answered not a days ride from here we found two lannister scouts feeding the crows where the freys had strung them up most of lord walders strength remains massed at the twins though that bore walder freys seal beyond a doubt catelyn thought bitterly hold back wait watch take no risk unless forced to it if hes been fighting the lannisters perhaps he does mean to hold to his vows robb said catelyn was less encouraged defending his own lands is one thing open battle against lord tywin quite another robb turned back to theon greyjoy has the blackfish found any other way across the green fork theon shook his head the rivers running high and fast ser brynden says it cant be forded not this far north i must have that crossing robb declared fuming oh our horses might be able to swim the river i suppose but not with armored men on their backs wed need to build rafts to pole our steel across helms and mail and lances and we dont have the trees for that or the time lord tywin is marching north he balled his hand into a fist lord frey would be a fool to try and bar our way theon greyjoy said with his customary easy confidence we have five times his numbers you can take the twins if you need to robb not easily catelyn warned them and not in time while you were mounting your siege tywin lannister would bring up his host and assault you from the rear robb glanced from her to greyjoy searching for an answer and finding none for a moment he looked even younger than his fifteen years despite his mail and sword and the stubble on his cheeks what would my lord father do he asked her find a way across she told him whatever it took the next morning it was ser brynden tully himself who rode back to them he had put aside the heavy plate and helm hed worn as the knight of the gate for the lighter leatherandmail of an outrider but his obsidian fish still fastened his cloak her uncles face was grave as he swung down off his horse there has been a battle under the walls of riverrun he said his mouth grim we had it from a lannister outrider we took captive the kingslayer has destroyed edmures host and sent the lords of the trident reeling in flight a cold hand clutched at catelyns heart and my brother wounded and taken prisoner ser brynden said lord blackwood and the other survivors are under siege inside riverrun surrounded by jaimes host robb looked fretful we must get across this accursed river if were to have any hope of relieving them page in time that will not be easily done her uncle cautioned lord frey has pulled his whole strength back inside his castles and his gates are closed and barred damn the man robb swore if the old fool does not relent and let me cross hell leave me no choice but to storm his walls ill pull the twins down around his ears if i have to well see how well he likes that you sound like a sulky boy robb catelyn said sharply a child sees an obstacle and his first thought is to run around it or knock it down a lord must learn that sometimes words can accomplish what swords cannot robbs neck reddened at the rebuke tell me what you mean mother he said meekly the freys have held the crossing for six hundred years and for six hundred years they have never failed to exact their toll what toll what does he want she smiled that is what we must discover and what if i do not choose to pay this toll then you had best retreat back to moat cailin deploy to meet lord tywin in battle or grow wings i see no other choices catelyn put her heels to her horse and rode off leaving her son to ponder her words it would not do to make him feel as if his mother were usurping his place did you teach him wisdom as well as valor ned she wondered didyou teach him how to kneel the graveyards of the seven kingdoms were full of brave men who had never learned that lesson it was near midday when their vanguard came in sight of the twins where the lords of the crossing had their seat the green fork ran swift and deep here but the freys had spanned it many centuries past and grown rich off the coin men paid them to cross their bridge was a massive arch of smooth grey rock wide enough for two wagons to pass abreast the water tower rose from the center of the span commanding both road and river with its arrow slits murder holes and portcullises it had taken the freys three generations to complete their bridge when they were done theyd thrown up stout timber keeps on either bank so no one might cross without their leave the timber had long since given way to stone the twinstwo squat ugly formidable castles identical in every respect with the bridge arching betweenhad guarded the crossing for centuries high curtain walls deep moats and heavy oakandiron gates protected the approaches the bridge footings rose from within stout inner keeps there was a barbican and portcullis on either bank and the water tower defended the span itself one glance was sufficient to tell catelyn that the castle would not be taken by storm the battlements bristled with spears and swords and scorpions there was an archer at every crenel and arrow slit the drawbridge was up the portcullis down the gates closed and barred page the greatjon began to curse and swear as soon as he saw what awaited them lord rickard karstark glowered in silence that cannot be assaulted my lords roose bolton announced nor can we take it by siege without an army on the far bank to invest the other castle helman tallhart said gloomily across the deeprunning green waters the western twin stood like a reflection of its eastern brother even if we had the time which to be sure we do not as the northern lords studied the castle a sally port opened a plank bridge slid across the moat and a dozen knights rode forth to confront them led by four of lord walders many sons their banner bore twin towers dark blue on a field of pale silvergrey ser stevron frey lord walders heir spoke for them the freys all looked like weasels ser stevron past sixty with grandchildren of his own looked like an especially old and tired weasel yet he was polite enough my lord father has sent me to greet you and inquire as to who leads this mighty host i do robb spurred his horse forward he was in his armor with the direwolf shield of winterfell strapped to his saddle and grey wind padding by his side the old knight looked at her son with a faint flicker of amusement in his watery grey eyes though his gelding whickered uneasily and sidled away from the direwolf my lord father would be most honored if you would share meat and mead with him in the castle and explain your purpose here his words crashed among the lords bannermen like a great stone from a catapult not one of them approved they cursed argued shouted down each other you must not do this my lord galbart glover pleaded with robb lord walder is not to be trusted roose bolton nodded go in there alone and youre his he can sell you to the lannisters throw you in a dungeon or slit your throat as he likes if he wants to talk to us let him open his gates and we will all share his meat and mead declared ser wendel manderly or let him come out and treat with robb here in plain sight of his men and ours suggested his brother ser wylis catelyn stark shared all their doubts but she had only to glance at ser stevron to see that he was not pleased by what he was hearing a few more words and the chance would be lost she had to act and quickly i will go she said loudly you my lady the greatjon furrowed his brow mother are you certain clearly robb was not never more catelyn lied glibly lord walder is my fathers bannerman i have known him since i was a girt he would never offer me any harm unless he saw some profit in it she added silently but some truths did not bear saying and some lies were necessary page i am certain my lord father would be pleased to speak to the lady catelyn ser stevron said to vouchsafe for our good intentions my brother ser perwyn will remain here until she is safely returned to you he shall be our honored guest said robb ser perwyn the youngest of the four freys in the party dismounted and handed the reins of his horse to a brother i require my lady mothers return by evenfall ser stevron robb went on it is not my intent to linger here long ser stevron frey gave a polite nod as you say my lord catelyn spurred her horse forward and did not look back lord walders sons and envoys fell in around her her father had once said of walder frey that he was the only lord in the seven kingdoms who could field an army out of his breeches when the lord of the crossing welcomed catelyn in the great hall of the east castle surrounded by twenty living sons minus ser perwyn who would have made twentyone thirtysix grandsons nineteen greatgrandsons and numerous daughters granddaughters bastards and grandbastards she understood just what he had meant lord walder was ninety a wizened pink weasel with a bald spotted head too gouty to stand unassisted his newest wife a pale frail girl of sixteen years walked beside his litter when they carried him in she was the eighth lady frey it is a great pleasure to see you again after so many years my lord catelyn said the old man squinted at her suspiciously is it i doubt that spare me your sweet words lady catelyn i am too old why are you here is your boy too proud to come before me himself what am i to do with you catelyn had been a girl the last time she had visited the twins but even then lord walder had been irascible sharp of tongue and blunt of manner age had made him worse than ever it would seem she would need to choose her words with care and do her best to take no offense from his father ser stevron said reproachfully you forget yourself lady stark is here at your invitation did i askyou you are not lord frey yet not until i die do i look dead ill hear no instructions from you this is no way to speak in front of our noble guest father one of his younger sons said now my bastards presume to teach me courtesy lord walder complained ill speak any way i like damn you ive had three kings to guest in my life and queens as well do you think i require lessons from the likes of you ryger your mother was milking goats the first time i gave her my seed he dismissed the redfaced youth with a flick of his fingers and gestured to two of his other sons danwell whalen help me to my chair they shifted lord walder from his litter and carried him to the high seat of the freys a tall chair of black oak whose back was carved in the shape of two towers linked by a bridge his young wife crept up page timidly and covered his legs with a blanket when he was settled the old man beckoned catelyn forward and planted a papery dry kiss on her hand there he announced now that i have observed the courtesies my lady perhaps my sons will do me the honor of shutting their mouths why are you here to ask you to open your gates my lord catelyn replied politely my son and his lords bannermen are most anxious to cross the river and be on their way to riverrun he sniggered oh no need to tell me no need im not blind yet the old man can still read a map to riverrun catelyn confirmed she saw no reason to deny it where i might have expected to find you my lord you are still my fathers bannerman are you not heh said lord walder a noise halfway between a laugh and a grunt i called my swords yes i did here they are you saw them on the walls it was my intent to march as soon as all my strength was assembled well to send my sons i am well past marching myself lady catelyn he looked around for likely confirmation and pointed to a tall stooped man of fifty years tell her jared tell her that was my intent it was my lady said ser jared frey one of his sons by his second wife on my honor is it my fault that your fool brother lost his battle before we could march he leaned back against his cushions and scowled at her as if challenging her to dispute his version of events i am told the kingslayer went through him like an axe through ripe cheese why should my boys hurry south to die all those who did go south are running north again catelyn would gladly have spitted the querulous old man and roasted him over a fire but she had only till evenfall to open the bridge calmly she said all the more reason that we must reach riverrun and soon where can we go to talk my lord were talking now lord frey complained the spotted pink head snapped around what are you all looking at he shouted at his kin get out of here lady stark wants to speak to me in private might be she has designs on my fidelity heh go all of you find something useful to do yes you too woman out out out as his sons and grandsons and daughters and bastards and nieces and nephews streamed from the hall he leaned close to catelyn and confessed theyre all waiting for me to die stevrons been waiting for forty years but i keep disappointing him heh why should i die just so he can be a lord i ask you i wont do it i have every hope that you will live to be a hundred that would boil them to be sure oh to be sure now what do you want to say we want to cross catelyn told him oh do you thats blunt why should i let you for a moment her anger flared if you were strong enough to climb your own battlements lord frey you would see that my son has twenty thousand men outside your walls page theyll be twenty thousand fresh corpses when lord tywin gets here the old man shot back dont you try and frighten me my lady your husbands in some traitors cell under the red keep your fathers sick might be dying and jaime lannisters got your brother in chains what do you have that i should fear that son of yours ill match you son for son and ill still have eighteen when yours are all dead you swore an oath to my father catelyn reminded him he bobbed his head side to side smiling oh yes i said some words but i swore oaths to the crown too it seems to me joffreys the king now and that makes you and your boy and all those fools out there no better than rebels if i had the sense the gods gave a fish id help the lannisters boil you all why dont you she challenged him lord walder snorted with disdain lord tywin the proud and splendid warden of the west hand of the king oh what a great man that one is him and his gold this and gold that and lions here and lions there ill wager you he cats too many beans he breaks wind just like me but youll never hear him admit it oh no whats he got to be so puffed up about anyway only two sons and one of thems a twisted little monster ill match him son for son and ill still have nineteen and a half left when all of his are dead he cackled if lord tywin wants my help he can bloody well ask for it that was all catelyn needed to hear i am asking for your help my lord she said humbly and my father and my brother and my lord husband and my sons are asking with my voice lord walder jabbed a bony finger at her face save your sweet words my lady sweet words i get from my wife did you see her sixteen she is a little flower and her honeys only for me i wager she gives me a son by this time next year perhaps ill make him heir wouldnt that boil the rest of them im certain she will give you many sons his head bobbed up and down your lord father did not come to the wedding an insult as i see it even if he is dying he never came to my last wedding either he calls me the late lord frey you know does he think im dead im not dead and i promise you ill outlive him as i outlived his father your family has always pissed on me dont deny it dont lie you know its true years ago i went to your father and suggested a match between his son and my daughter why not i had a daughter in mind sweet girl only a few years older than edmure but if your brother didnt warm to her i had others he might have had young ones old ones virgins widows whatever he wanted no lord hoster would not hear of it sweet words he gave me excuses but what i wanted was to get rid of a daughter and your sister that one shes full as bad it was oh a year ago no more jon arryn was still the kings hand and i went to the city to see my sons ride in the tourney stevron and jared are too old for the lists now but danwell and hosteen rode perwyn as well and a couple of my bastards tried the melee if id known how theyd shame me i would never have troubled myself to make the journey why did i need to ride all that way to see hosteen knocked off his horse by that tyrell whelp i ask you the boys half his age ser daisy they call him something like that and danwell was unhorsed by a hedge knight some days i wonder if those two are truly mine my third wife was a crakehall all of the page crakehall women are sluts well never mind about that she died before you were born what do you care i was speaking of your sister i proposed that lord and lady arryn foster two of my grandsons at court and offered to take their own son to ward here at the twins are my grandsons unworthy to be seen at the kings court they are sweet boys quiet and mannerly walder is merretts son named after me and the other one heh i dont recall he might have been another walder theyre always naming them walder so ill favor them but his father which one was his father now his face wrinkled up well whoever he was lord arryn wouldnt have him or the other one and i blame your lady sister for that she frosted up as if id suggested selling her boy to a mummers show or making a eunuch out of him and when lord arryn said the child was going to dragonstone to foster with stannis baratheon she stormed off without a word of regrets and all the hand could give me was apologies what good are apologies i ask you catelyn frowned disquieted i had understood that lysas boy was to be fostered with lord tywin at casterly rock no it was lord stannis waider frey said irritably do you think i cant tell lord stannis from lord tywin theyre both bungholes who think theyre too noble to shit but never mind about that i know the difference or do you think im so old i cant remember im ninety and i remember very well i remember what to do with a woman too that wife of mine will give me a son before this time next year ill wager or a daughter that cant be helped boy or girl it will be red wrinkled and squalling and like as not shell want to name it walder or walda catelyn was not concerned with what lady frey might choose to name her child jon arryn was going to foster his son with lord stannis you are quite certain of that yes yes yes the old man said only he died so what does it matter you say you want to cross the river we do well you cant lord walder announced crisply not unless i allow it and why should i the tullys and the starks have never been friends of mine he pushed himself back in his chair and crossed his arms smirking waiting for her answer the rest was only haggling a swollen red sun hung low against the western hills when the gates of the castle opened the drawbridge creaked down the portcullis winched up and lady catelyn stark rode forth to rejoin her son and his lords bannermen behind her came ser jared frey ser hosteen frey ser danwell frey and lord walders bastard son ronel rivers leading a long column of pikemen rank on rank of shuffling men in blue steel ringmail and silvery grey cloaks robb galloped out to meet her with grey wind racing beside his stallion its done she told him lord walder will grant you your crossing his swords are yours as well less four hundred he means to keep back to hold the twins i suggest that you leave four hundred of your own a mixed force of archers and swordsmen he can scarcely object to an offer to augment his garrison but make certain you give the command to a man you can trust lord walder may need help keeping faith page as you say mother robb answered gazing at the ranks of pikemen perhaps ser helman tallhart do you think a fine choice what what did he want of us if you can spare a few of your swords i need some men to escort two of lord freys grandsons north to winterfell she told him i have agreed to take them as wards they are young boys aged eight years and seven it would seem they are both named walder your brother bran will welcome the companionship of lads near his own age i should think is that all two fosterlings thats a small enough price to lord freys son olyvar will be coming with us she went on he is to serve as your personal squire his father would like to see him knighted in good time a squire he shrugged fine thats fine if hes also if your sister arya is returned to us safely it is agreed that she will marry lord walders youngest son elmar when the two of them come of age robb looked nonplussed arya wont like that one bit and you are to wed one of his daughters once the fighting is done she finished his lordship has graciously consented to allow you to choose whichever girl you prefer he has a number he thinks might be suitable to his credit robb did not flinch i see do you consent can i refuse not if you wish to cross i consent robb said solemnly he had never seemed more manly to her than he did in that moment boys might play with swords but it took a lord to make a marriage pact knowing what it meant they crossed at evenfall as a horned moon floated upon the river the double column wound its way through the gate of the eastern twin like a great steel snake slithering across the courtyard into the keep and over the bridge to issue forth once more from the second castle on the west bank catelyn rode at the head of the serpent with her son and her uncle ser brynden and ser stevron frey behind followed nine tenths of their horse knights lancers freeriders and mounted bowmen it took hours for them all to cross afterward catelyn would remember the clatter of countless hooves on the drawbridge the sight of lord walder frey in his litter watching them pass the glitter of eyes peering down through the slats of the murder holes in the ceiling as they rode through the water tower page the larger part of the northern host pikes and archers and great masses of menatarms on foot remained upon the east bank under the command of roose bolton robb had commanded him to continue the march south to confront the huge lannister army coming north under lord tywin for good or ill her son had thrown the dice jon are you well snow lord mormont asked scowling well his raven squawked well i am my lord jon lied loudly as if that could make it true and you mormont frowned a dead man tried to kill me how well could i be he scratched under his chin his shaggy grey beard had been singed in the fire and hed hacked it off the pale stubble of his new whiskers made him look old disreputable and grumpy you do not look well how is your hand healing jon flexed his bandaged fingers to show him he had burned himself more badly than he knew throwing the flaming drapes and his right hand was swathed in silk halfway to the elbow at the time hed felt nothing the agony had come after his cracked red skin oozed fluid and fearsome blood blisters rose between his fingers big as roaches the maester says ill have scars but otherwise the hand should be as good as it was before a scarred hand is nothing on the wall youll be wearing gloves often as not as you say my lord it was not the thought of scars that troubled jon it was the rest of it maester aemon had given him milk of the poppy yet even so the pain had been hideous at first it had felt as if his hand were still aflame burning day and night only plunging it into basins of snow and shaved ice gave any relief at all jon thanked the gods that no one but ghost saw him writhing on his bed whimpering from the pain and when at last he did sleep he dreamt and that was even worse in the dream the corpse he fought had blue eyes black hands and his fathers face but he dared not tell mormont that dywen and hake returned last night the old bear said they found no sign of your uncle no more than the others did i know jon had dragged himself to the common hall to sup with his friends and the failure of the rangers search had been all the men had been talking of you know mormont grumbled how is it that everyone knows everything around here he did not seem to expect an answer it would seem there were only the two of of those creatures whatever they were i will not call them men and thank the gods for that any more and well that doesnt bear thinking of there will be more though i can feel it in these old bones of mine and maester aemon agrees the cold winds are rising summer is at an end and a winter is coming such as this world has never seen page winter is coming the stark words had never sounded so grim or ominous to jon as they did now my lord he asked hesitantly its said there was a bird last night there was what of it i had hoped for some word of my father father taunted the old raven bobbing its head as it walked across mormonts shoulders father the lord commander reached up to pinch its beak shut but the raven hopped up on his head fluttered its wings and flew across the chamber to light above a window grief and noise mormont grumbled thats all theyre good for ravens why i put up with that pestilential bird if there was news of lord eddard dont you think i would have sent for you bastard or no youre still his blood the message concerned ser barristan selmy it seems hes been removed from the kingsguard they gave his place to that black dog clegane and now selmys wanted for treason the fools sent some watchmen to seize him but he slew two of them and escaped mormont snorted leaving no doubt of his view of men whod send gold cloaks against a knight as renowed as barristan the bold we have white shadows in the woods and unquiet dead stalking our halls and a boy sits the iron throne he said in disgust the raven laughed shrilly boy boy boy boy ser barristan had been the old bears best hope jon remembered if he had fallen what chance was there that mormonts letter would be heeded he curled his hand into a fist pain shot through his burned fingers what of my sisters the message made no mention of lord eddard or the girls he gave an irritated shrug perhaps they never got my letter aemon sent two copies with his best birds but who can say more like pycelle did not deign to reply it would not be the first time nor the last i fear we count for less than nothing in kings landing they tell us what they want us to know and thats little enough and you tell me what you want me to know and thats less jon thought resentfully his brother robb had called the banners and ridden south to war yet no word of that had been breathed to him save by samwell tarly whod read the letter to maester aemon and whispered its contents to jon that night in secret all the time saying how he shouldnt doubtless they thought his brothers war was none of his concern it troubled him more than he could say robb was marching and he was not no matter how often jon told himself that his place was here now with his new brothers on the wall he still felt craven corn the raven was crying corn corn oh be quiet the old bear told it snow how soon does maester aemon say youll have use of that hand back soon jon replied good on the table between them lord mormont laid a large sword in a black metal scabbard banded with silver here youll be ready for this then the raven flapped down and landed on the table strutting toward the sword head cocked curiously page jon hesitated he had no inkling what this meant my lord the fire melted the silver off the pommel and burnt the crossguard and grip well dry leather and old wood what could you expect the blade now youd need a fire a hundred times as hot to harm the blade mormont shoved the scabbard across the rough oak planks i had the rest made anew take it take it echoed his raven preening take it take it awkwardly jon took the sword in hand his left hand his bandaged right was still too raw and clumsy carefully he pulled it from its scabbard and raised it level with his eyes the pommel was a hunk of pale stone weighted with lead to balance the long blade it had been carved into the likeness of a snarling wolfs head with chips of garnet set into the eyes the grip was virgin leather soft and black as yet unstained by sweat or blood the blade itself was a good half foot longer than those jon was used to tapered to thrust as well as slash with three fullers deeply incised in the metal where ice was a true twohanded greatsword this was a handandahalfer sometimes named a bastard sword yet the wolf sword actually seemed lighter than the blades he had wielded before when jon turned it sideways he could see the ripples in the dark steel where the metal had been folded back on itself again and again this is valyrian steel my lord he said wonderingly his father had let him handle ice often enough he knew the look the feel it is the old bear told him it was my fathers sword and his fathers before him the mormonts have carried it for five centuries i wielded it in my day and passed it on to my son when i took the black he is giving me his sons sword jon could scarcely believe it the blade was exquisitely balanced the edges glimmered faintly as they kissed the light your son my son brought dishonor to house mormont but at least he had the grace to leave the sword behind when he fled my sister returned it to my keeping but the very sight of it reminded me of jorahs shame so i put it aside and thought no more of it until we found it in the ashes of my bedchamber the original pommel was a bears head silver yet so worn its features were all but indistinguishable for you i thought a white wolf more apt one of our builders is a fair stonecarver when jon had been brans age he had dreamed of doing great deeds as boys always did the details of his feats changed with every dreaming but quite often he imagined saving his fathers life afterward lord eddard would declare that jon had proved himself a true stark and place ice in his hand even then he had known it was only a childs folly no bastard could ever hope to wield a fathers sword even the memory shamed him what kind of man stole his own brothers birthright i have no right to this he thought no more than to ke he twitched his burned fingers feeling a throb of pain deep under the skin my lord you honor me but spare me your buts boy lord mormont interrupted i would not be sitting here were it not for you and that beast of yours you fought bravely and more to the point you thought quickly fire yes damn it we ought to have known we ought to have remembered the long night has come before oh eight thousand years is a good while to be sure yet if the nights watch does not remember who will page who will chimed the talkative raven o will truly the gods had heard jons prayer that night the fire had caught in the dead mans clothing and consumed him as if his flesh were candle wax and his bones old dry wood jon had only to close his eyes to see the thing staggering across the solar crashing against the furniture and flailing at the flames it was the face that haunted him most surrounded by a nimbus of fire hair blazing like straw the dead flesh melting away and sloughing off its skull to reveal the gleam of bone beneath whatever demonic force moved othor had been driven out by the flames the twisted thing they had found in the ashes had been no more than cooked meat and charred bone yet in his nightmare he faced it again and this time the burning corpse wore lord eddards features it was his fathers skin that burst and blackened his fathers eyes that ran liquid down his cheeks like jellied tears jon did not understand why that should be or what it might mean but it frightened him more than he could say a swords small payment for a life mormont concluded take it ill hear no more of it is that understood yes my lord the soft leather gave beneath jons fingers as if the sword were molding itself to his grip already he knew he should be honored and he was and yet he is not my father the thought leapt unbidden to jons mind lord eddard stark is my father i will not forget him no matter how many swords they give me yet he could scarcely tell lord mormont that it was another mans sword he dreamt of i want no courtesies either mormont said so thank me no thanks honor the steel with deeds not words jon nodded does it have a name my lord it did once longclaw it was called claw the raven cried claw longclaw is an apt name jon tried a practice cut he was clumsy and uncomfortable with his left hand yet even so the steel seemed to flow through the air as if it had a will of its own wolves have claws as much as bears the old bear seemed pleased by that i suppose they do youll want to wear that over the shoulder i imagine its too long for the hip at least until youve put on a few inches and youll need to work at your twohanded strikes as well ser endrew can show you some moves when your burns have healed ser endrew jon did not know the name ser endrew tarth a good man hes on his way from the shadow tower to assume the duties of masteratarms ser alliser thorne left yestermorn for eastwatchbythesea jon lowered the sword why he said stupidly page mormont snorted because i sent him why do you think hes bringing the hand your ghost tore off the end of jafer flowerss wrist i have commanded him to take ship to kings landing and lay it before this boy king that should get young joffreys attention id think and ser allisers a knight highborn anointed with old friends at court altogether harder to ignore than a glorified crow crow jon thought the raven sounded faintly indignant as well the lord commander continued ignoring the birds protest it puts a thousand leagues twixt him and you without it seeming a rebuke he jabbed a finger up at jons face and dont think this means i approve of that nonsense in the common hall valor makes up for a fair amount of folly but youre not a boy anymore however many years youve seen thats a mans sword you have there and it will take a man to wield her ill expect you to act the part henceforth yes my lord jon slid the sword back into the silverbanded scabbard if not the blade he would have chosen it was nonetheless a noble gift and freeing him from alliser thornes malignance was nobler still the old bear scratched at his chin i had forgotten how much a new beard itches he said well no help for that is that hand of yours healed enough to resume your duties yes my lord good the night will be cold ill want hot spice wine find me a flagon of red not too sour and dont skimp on the spices and tell hobb that if he sends me boiled mutton again im like to boil him that last haunch was grey even the bird wouldnt touch it he stroked the ravens head with his thumb and the bird made a contented quorking sound away with you ive work to do the guards smiled at him from their niches as he wound his way down the turret stair carrying the sword in his good hand sweet steel one man said you earned that snow another told him jon made himself smile back at them but his heart was not in it he knew he should be pleased yet he did not feel it his hand ached and the taste of anger was in his mouth though he could not have said who he was angry with or why a half dozen of his friends were lurking outside when he left the kings tower where lord commander mormont now made his residence theyd hung a target on the granary doors so they could seem to be honing their skills as archers but he knew lurkers when he saw them no sooner did he emerge than pyp called out well come about lets have a look at what jon said toad sidled close your rosy butt cheeks what else the sword grenn stated we want to see the sword jon raked them with an accusing look you knew page pyp grinned were not all as dumb as grenn you are so insisted grenn youre dumber halder gave an apologetic shrug i helped pate carve the stone for the pommel the builder said and your friend sam bought the garnets in moles town we knew even before that though grenn said rudge has been helping donal noye in the forge he was there when the old bear brought him the burnt blade the sword matt insisted the others took up the chant the sword the sword the sword jon unsheathed longclaw and showed it to them turning it this way and that so they could admire it the bastard blade glittered in the pale sunlight dark and deadly valyrian steel he declared solemnly trying to sound as pleased and proud as he ought to have felt i heard of a man who had a razor made of valyrian steel declared toad he cut his head off trying to shave pyp grinned the nights watch is thousands of years old he said but ill wager lord snows the first brother ever honored for burning down the lord commanders tower the others laughed and even jon had to smile the fire hed started had not in truth burned down that formidable stone tower but it had done a fair job of gutting the interior of the top two floors where the old bear had his chambers no one seemed to mind that very much since it had also destroyed othors murderous corpse the other wight the onehanded thing that had once been a ranger named jafer flowers had also been destroyed cut near to pieces by a dozen swords but not before it had slain ser jaremy rykker and four other men ser jaremy had finished the job of hacking its head off yet had died all the same when the headless corpse pulled his own dagger from its sheath and buried it in his bowels strength and courage did not avail much against foemen who would not fall because they were already dead even arms and armor offered small protection that grim thought soured jons fragile mood i need to see hobb about the old bears supper he announced brusquely sliding longclaw back into its scabbard his friends meant well but they did not understand it was not their fault truly they had not had to face othor they had not seen the pale glow of those dead blue eyes had not felt the cold of those dead black fingers nor did they know of the fighting in the riverlands how could they hope to comprehend he turned away from them abruptly and strode off sullen pyp called after him but jon paid him no mind they had moved him back to his old cell in tumbledown hardins tower after the fire and it was there he returned ghost was curled up asleep beside the door but he lifted his head at the sound of jons boots the direwolfs red eyes were darker than garnets and wiser than men jon knelt scratched his ear and showed him the pommel of the sword look its you ghost sniffed at his carved stone likeness and tried a lick jon smiled youre the one deserves an honor he told the wolf and suddenly he found himself remembering how hed found him that day in the late summer snow they had been riding off with the other pups but jon had heard a noise and page turned back and there he was white fur almost invisible against the drifts he was all alone he thought apart from the others in the litter he was different so they drove him out jon he looked up samwell tarly stood rocking nervously on his heels his cheeks were red and he was wrapped in a heavy fur cloak that made him look ready for hibernation sam jon stood what is it do you want to see the sword if the others had known no doubt sam did too the fat boy shook his head i was heir to my fathers blade once he said mournfully heartsbane lord randyll let me hold it a few times but it always scared me it was valyrian steel beautiful but so sharp i was afraid id hurt one of my sisters dickon will have it now he wiped sweaty hands on his cloak i ah maester aemon wants to see you it was not time for his bandages to be changed jon frowned suspiciously why he demanded sam looked miserable that was answer enough you told him didnt you jon said angrily you told him that you told me i he jon i didnt want to he asked i mean i think he knew he sees things no one else sees hes blind jon pointed out forcefully disgusted i can find the way myself he left sam standing there openmouthed and quivering he found maester aemon up in the rookery feeding the ravens clydas was with him carrying a bucket of chopped meat as they shuffled from cage to cage sam said you wanted me the maester nodded i did indeed clydas give jon the bucket perhaps he will be kind enough to assist me the hunched pinkeyed brother handed jon the bucket and scurried down the ladder toss the meat into the cages aemon instructed him the birds will do the rest jon shifted the bucket to his right hand and thrust his left down into the bloody bits the ravens began to scream noisily and fly at the bars beating at the metal with nightblack wings the meat had been chopped into pieces no larger than a finger joint he filled his fist and tossed the raw red morsels into the cage and the squawking and squabbling grew hotter feathers flew as two of the larger birds fought over a choice piece quickly jon grabbed a second handful and threw it in after the first lord mormonts raven likes fruit and corn he is a rare bird the maester said most ravens will eat grain but they prefer flesh it makes them strong and i fear they relish the taste of blood in that they are like men and like men not all ravens are alike jon had nothing to say to that he threw meat wondering why hed been summoned no doubt the old man would tell him in his own good time maester aemon was not a man to be hurried doves and pigeons can also be trained to carry messages the maester went on though the raven is a stronger flyer larger bolder far more clever better able to defend itself against hawks yet ravens are black and they eat the dead so some godly men abhor them baelor the blessed tried to replace all the page ravens with doves did you know the maester turned his white eyes on jon smiling the nights watch prefers ravens jons fingers were in the bucket blood up to the wrist dywen says the wildlings call us crows he said uncertainty the crow is the ravens poor cousin they are both beggars in black hated and misunderstood jon wished he understood what they were talking about and why what did he care about ravens and doves if the old man had something to say to him why couldnt he just say it jon did you ever wonder why the men of the nights watch take no wives and father no children maester aemon asked jon shrugged no he scattered more meat the fingers of his left hand were slimy with blood and his right throbbed from the weight of the bucket so they will not love the old man answered for love is the bane of honor the death of duty that did not sound right to jon yet he said nothing the maester was a hundred years old and a high officer of the nights watch it was not his place to contradict him the old man seemed to sense his doubts tell me jon if the day should ever come when your lord father must needs choose between honor on the one hand and those he loves on the other what would he do jon hesitated he wanted to say that lord eddard would never dishonor himself not even for love yet inside a small sly voice whispered he fathered a bastard where was the honor in that and your mother what of his duty to her he will not even say her name he would do whatever was right he said ringingly to make up for his hesitation no matter what then lord eddard is a man in ten thousand most of us are not so strong what is honor compared to a womans love what is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms or the memory of a brothers smile wind and words wind and words we are only human and the gods have fashioned us for love that is our great glory and our great tragedy the men who formed the nights watch knew that only their courage shielded the realm from the darkness to the north they knew they must have no divided loyalties to weaken their resolve so they vowed they would have no wives nor children yet brothers they had and sisters mothers who gave them birth fathers who gave them names they came from a hundred quarrelsome kingdoms and they knew times may change but men do not so they pledged as well that the nights watch would take no part in the battles of the realms it guarded they kept their pledge when aegon slew black harren and claimed his kingdom harrens brother was lord commander on the wall with ten thousand swords to hand he did not march in the days when the seven mngdoms were seven kingdoms not a generation passed that three or four of them were not at war the watch took no part when the andals crossed the narrow sea and swept away the page kingdoms of the first men the sons of the fallen kings held true to their vows and remained at their posts so it has always been for years beyond counting such is the price of honor a craven can be as brave as any man when there is nothing to fear and we all do our duty when there is no cost to it how easy it seems then to walk the path of honor yet soon or late in every mans life comes a day when it is not easy a day when he must choose some of the ravens were still eating long stringy bits of meat dangling from their beaks the rest seemed to be watching him jon could feel the weight of all those tiny black eyes and this is my day is that what youre saying maester aemon turned his head and looked at him with those dead white eyes it was as if he were seeing right into his heart jon felt naked and exposed he took the bucket in both hands and flung the rest of the slops through the bars strings of meat and blood flew everywhere scattering the ravens they took to the air shrieking wildly the quicker birds snatched morsels on the wing and gulped them down greedily jon let the empty bucket clang to the floor the old man laid a withered spotted hand on his shoulder it hurts boy he said softly oh yes choosing it has always hurt and always will i know you dont know jon said bitterly no one knows even if i am his bastard hes still my father maester aemon sighed have you heard nothing ive told you jon do you think you are the first he shook his ancient head a gesture weary beyond words three times the gods saw fit to test my vows once when i was a boy once in the fullness of my manhood and once when i had grown old by then my strength was fled my eyes grown dim yet that last choice was as cruel as the first my ravens would bring the news from the south words darker than their wings the ruin of my house the death of my kin disgrace and desolation what could i have done old blind frail i was helpless as a suckling babe yet still it grieved me to sit forgotten as they cut down my brothers poor grandson and his son and even the little children jon was shocked to see the shine of tears in the old mans eyes who are you he asked quietly almost in dread a toothless smile quivered on the ancient lips only a maester of the citadel bound in service to castle black and the nights watch in my order we put aside our house names when we take our vows and don the collar the old man touched the maesters chain that hung loosely around his thin fleshless neck my father was maekar the first of his name and my brother aegon reigned after him in my stead my grandfather named me for prince aemon the dragonknight who was his uncle or his father depending on which tale you believe aemon he called me aemon targaryen jon could scarcely believe it once the old man said once so you see jon i do know and knowing i will not tell you stay or go you must make that choice yourself and live with it all the rest of your days as i have his voice fell to a whisper as i have page daenerys when the battle was done dany rode her silver through the fields of the dead her handmaids and the men of her khas came after smiling and jesting among themselves dothraki hooves had torn the earth and trampled the rye and lentils into the ground while arakhs and arrows had sown a terrible new crop and watered it with blood dying horses lifted their heads and screamed at her as she rode past wounded men moaned and prayed jaqqa rhan moved among them the mercy men with their heavy axes taking a harvest of heads from the dead and dying alike after them would scurry a flock of small girls pulling arrows from the corpses to fill their baskets last of all the dogs would come sniffing lean and hungry the feral pack that was never far behind the khalasar the sheep had been dead longest there seemed to be thousands of them black with flies arrow shafts bristling from each carcass khal ogos riders had done that dany knew no man of drogos khalasar would be such a fool as to waste his arrows on sheep when there were shepherds yet to kill the town was afire black plumes of smoke roiling and tumbling as they rose into a hard blue sky beneath broken walls of dried mud riders galloped back and forth swinging their long whips as they herded the survivors from the smoking rubble the women and chil dren of ogos khalasar walked with a sullen pride even in defeat and bondage they were slaves now but they seemed not to fear it it was different with the townsfolk dany pitied them she remembered what terror felt like mothers stumbled along with blank dead faces pulling sobbing children by the hand there were only a few men among them cripples and cowards and grandfathers ser jorah said the people of this country named themselves the lhazareen but the dothraki called them haesh rakhi the lamb men once dany might have taken them for dothraki for they had the same copper skin and almondshaped eyes now they looked alien to her squat and flatfaced their black hair cropped unnaturally short they were herders of sheep and eaters of vegetables and khal drogo said they belonged south of the river bend the grass of the dothraki sea was not meant for sheep dany saw one boy bolt and run for the river a rider cut him off and turned him and the others boxed him in cracking their whips in his face running him this way and that one galloped behind him lashing him across the buttocks until his thighs ran red with blood another snared his ankle with a lash and sent him sprawling finally when the boy could only crawl they grew bored of the sport and put an arrow through his back ser jorah met her outside the shattered gate he wore a dark green surcoat over his mail his gauntlets greaves and greathelm were dark grey steel the dothraki had mocked him for a coward when he donned his armor but the knight had spit insults right back in their teeth tempers had flared longsword had clashed with arakh and the rider whose taunts had been loudest had been left behind to bleed to death ser jorah lifted the visor of his flattopped greathelm as he rode up your lord husband awaits you within the town drogo took no harm page a few cuts ser jorah answered nothing of consequence he slew two khals this day khal ogo first and then the son fogo who became khal when ogo fell his bloodriders cut the bells from their hair and now khal drogos every step rings louder than before ogo and his son had shared the high bench with her lord husband at the naming feast where viserys had been crowned but that was in vaes dothrak beneath the mother of mountains where every rider was a brother and all quarrels were put aside it was different out in the grass ogos khalasar had been attacking the town when khal drogo caught him she wondered what the lamb men had thought when they first saw the dust of their horses from atop those crackedmud walls perhaps a few the younger and more foolish who still believed that the gods heard the prayers of desperate men took it for deliverance across the road a girl no older than dany was sobbing in a high thin voice as a rider shoved her over a pile of corpses facedown and thrust himself inside her other riders dismounted to take their turns that was the sort of deliverance the dothraki brought the lamb men i am the blood of the dragon daenerys targaryen reminded herself as she turned her face away she pressed her lips together and hardened her heart and rode on toward the gate most of ogos riders fled ser jorah was saying still there may be as many as ten thousand captives slaves dany thought khal drogo would drive them downriver to one of the towns on slavers bay she wanted to cry but she told herself that she must be strong this is war this is what it looks like this is the price of the iron throne ive told the khal he ought to make for meereen ser jorah said theyll pay a better price than hed get from a slaving caravan illyrio writes that they had a plague last year so the brothels are paying double for healthy young girls and triple for boys under ten if enough children survive the journey the gold will buy us all the ships we need and hire men to sail them behind them the girl being raped made a heartrending sound a long sobbing wail that went on and on and on danys hand clenched hard around the reins and she turned the silvers head make them stop she commanded ser jorah khaleesi the knight sounded perplexed you heard my words she said stop them she spoke to her khas in the harsh accents of dothraki jhogo quaro you will aid ser jorah i want no rape the warriors exchanged a baffled look jorah mormont spurred his horse closer princess he said you have a gentle heart but you do not understand this is how it has always been those men have shed blood for the khal now they claim their reward across the road the girl was still crying her high singsong tongue strange to danys ears the first man page was done with her now and a second had taken his place she is a lamb girl quaro said in dothraki she is nothing khaleesi the riders do her honor the lamb men lay with sheep it is known it is known her handmaid irri echoed it is known agreed jhogo astride the tall grey stallion that drogo had given him if her wailing offends your ears khaleesi jhogo will bring you her tongue he drew his arakh i will not have her harmed dany said i claim her do as i command you or khal drogo will know the reason why ai khaleesi jhogo replied kicking his horse quaro and the others followed his lead the bells in their hair chiming go with them she commanded ser jorah as you command the knight gave her a curious look you are your brothers sister in truth viserys she did not understand no he answered rhaegar he galloped off dany heard jhogo shout the rapers laughed at him one man shouted back jhogos arakh flashed and the mans head went tumbling from his shoulders laughter turned to curses as the horsemen reached for weapons but by then quaro and aggo and rakharo were there she saw aggo point across the road to where she sat upon her silver the riders looked at her with cold black eyes one spat the others scattered to their mounts muttering all the while the man atop the lamb girl continued to plunge in and out of her so intent on his pleasure that he seemed unaware of what was going on around him ser jorah dismounted and wrenched him off with a mailed hand the dothraki went sprawling in the mud bounced up with a knife in hand and died with aggos arrow through his throat mormont pulled the girl off the pile of corpses and wrapped her in his bloodspattered cloak he led her across the road to dany what do you want done with her the girl was trembling her eyes wide and vague her hair was matted with blood doreah see to her hurts you do not have a riders look perhaps she will not fear you the rest with me she urged the silver through the broken wooden gate it was worse inside the town many of the houses were afire and the jaqqa rhan had been about their grisly work headless corpses filled the narrow twisty lanes they passed other women being raped each time dany reined up sent her khas to make an end to it and claimed the victim as slave one of them a thickbodied flatnosed woman of forty years blessed dany haltingly in the common tongue but from the others she got only flat black stares they were suspicious of her she realized with sadness afraid that she had saved them for some worse fate you cannot claim them all child ser jorah said the fourth time page they stopped while the warriors of her khas herded her new slaves behind her i am khaleesi heir to the seven kingdoms the blood of the dragon dany reminded him it is not for you to tell me what i cannot do across the city a building collapsed in a great gout of fire and smoke and she heard distant screams and the wailing of frightened children they found khal drogo seated before a square windowless temple with thick mud walls and a bulbous dome like some immense brown onion beside him was a pile of heads taller than he was one of the short arrows of the lamb men stuck through the meat of his upper arm and blood covered the left side of his bare chest like a splash of paint his three bloodriders were with him jhiqui helped dany dismount she had grown clumsy as her belly grew larger and heavier she knelt before the khal my sunandstars is wounded the arakh cut was wide but shallow his left nipple was gone and a flap of bloody flesh and skin dangled from his chest like a wet rag is scratch moon of life from arakh of one bloodrider to khal ogo khal drogo said in the common tongue i kill him for it and ogo too he turned his head the bells in his braid ringing softly is ogo you hear and fogo his khalakka who was khal when i slew him no man can stand before the sun of my life dany said the father of the stallion who mounts the world a mounted warrior rode up and vaulted from his saddle he spoke to haggo a stream of angry dothraki too fast for dany to understand the huge bloodrider gave her a heavy look before he turned to his khal this one is mago who rides in the khas of ko jhaqo he says the khaleesi has taken his spoils a daughter of the lambs who was his to mount khal drogos face was still and hard but his black eyes were curious as they went to dany tell me the truth of this moon of my life he commanded in dothraki dany told him what she had done in his own tongue so the khal would understand her better her words simple and direct when she was done drogo was frowning this is the way of war these women are our slaves now to do with as we please it pleases me to hold them safe dany said wondering if she had dared too much if your warriors would mount these women let them take them gently and keep them for wives give them places in the khalasar and let them bear you sons qotho was ever the cruelest of the bloodriders it was he who laughed does the horse breed with the sheep something in his tone reminded her of viserys dany turned on him angrily the dragon feeds on horse and sheep alike khal drogo smiled see how fierce she grows he said it is my son inside her the stallion who page mounts the world filling her with his fire ride slowly ootho if the mother does not burn you where you sit the son will trample you into the mud and you mago hold your tongue and find another lamb to mount these belong to my khaleesi he started to reach out a hand to daenerys but as he lifted his arm drogo grimaced in sudden pain and turned his head dany could almost feel his agony the wounds were worse than ser jorah had led her to believe where are the healers she demanded the khalasar had two sorts barren women and eunuch slaves the herbwomen dealt in potions and spells the eunuchs in knife needle and fire why do they not attend the khal the khal sent the hairless men away khaleesi old cohollo assured her dany saw the bloodrider had taken a wound himself a deep gash in his left shoulder many riders are hurt khal drogo said stubbornly let them be healed first this arrow is no more than the bite of a fly this little cut only a new scar to boast of to my son dany could see the muscles in his chest where the skin had been cut away a trickle of blood ran from the arrow that pierced his arm it is not for khal drogo to wait she proclaimed jhogo seek out these eunuchs and bring them here at once silver lady a womans voice said behind her i can help the great rider with his hurts dany turned her head the speaker was one of the slaves she had claimed the heavy flatnosed woman who had blessed her the khal needs no help from women who lie with sheep barked qotho aggo cut out her tongue aggo grabbed her hair and pressed a knife to her throat dany lifted a hand no she is mine let her speak aggo looked from her to qotho he lowered his knife i meant no wrong fierce riders the woman spoke dothraki well the robes she wore had once been the lightest and finest of woolens rich with embroidery but now they were mudcaked and bloody and ripped she clutched the torn cloth of her bodice to her heavy breasts i have some small skill in the healing arts who are you dany asked her i am named mirri maz duur i am godswife of this temple maegi grunted haggo fingering his arakh his look was dark dany remembered the word from a terrifying story that jhiqui had told her one night by the cookfire a maegi was a woman who lay with demons and practiced the blackest of sorceries a vile thing evil and soulless who came to men in the dark of night and sucked life and strength from their bodies i am a healer mirri maz duur said page a healer of sheeps sneered qotho blood of my blood i say kill this maegi and wait for the hairless men dany ignored the bloodriders outburst this old homely thickbodied woman did not look like a maegi to her where did you learn your healing mirri maz duur my mother was godswife before me and taught me all the songs and spells most pleasing to the great shepherd and how to make the sacred smokes and ointments from leaf and root and berry when i was younger and more fair i went in caravan to asshai by the shadow to learn from their mages ships from many lands come to asshai so i lingered long to study the healing ways of distant peoples a moonsinger of the jogos nhai gifted me with her birthing songs a woman of your own riding people taught me the magics of grass and corn and horse and a maester from the sunset lands opened a body for me and showed me all the secrets that hide beneath the skin ser jorah mormont spoke up a maester marwyn he named himself the woman replied in the common tongue from the sea beyond the sea the seven lands he said sunset lands where men are iron and dragons rule he taught me this speech a maester in asshai ser jorah mused tell me godswife what did this marwyn wear about his neck a chain so tight it was like to choke him iron lord with links of many metals the knight looked at dany only a man trained in the citadel of oldtown wears such a chain he said and such men do know much of healing why should you want to help my khal all men are one flock or so we are taught replied mirri maz duur the great shepherd sent me to earth to heal his lambs wherever i might find them qotho gave her a stinging slap we are no sheep maegi stop it dany said angrily she is mine i will not have her harmed khal drogo grunted the arrow must come out qotho yes great rider mirri maz duur answered touching her bruised face and your breast must be washed and sewn lest the wound fester do it then kbal drogo commanded great rider the woman said my tools and potions are inside the gods house where the healing powers are strongest i will carry you blood of my blood haggo offered page khal drogo waved him away i need no mans help he said in a voice proud and hard he stood unaided towering over them all a fresh wave of blood ran down his breast from where ogos arakh had cut off his nipple dany moved quickly to his side i am no man she whispered so you may lean on me drogo put a huge hand on her shoulder she took some of his weight as they walked toward the great mud temple the three bloodriders followed dany commanded ser jorah and the warriors of her khas to guard the entrance and make certain no one set the building afire while they were still inside they passed through a series of anterooms into the high central chamber under the onion faint light shone down through hidden windows above a few torches burnt smokily from sconces on the walls sheepskins were scattered across the mud floor there mirri maz duur said pointing to the altar a massive blueveined stone carved with images of shepherds and their flocks khal drogo lay upon it the old woman threw a handful of dried leaves onto a brazier filling the chamber with fragrant smoke best if you wait outside she told the rest of them we are blood of his blood cohollo said here we wait qotho stepped close to mirri maz duur know this wife of the lamb god harm the khal and you suffer the same he drew his skinning knife and showed her the blade she will do no harm dany felt she could trust this old plainfaced woman with her flat nose she had saved her from the hard hands of her rapers after all if you must stay then help mirri told the bloodriders the great rider is too strong for me hold him still while i draw the arrow from his flesh she let the rags of her gown fall to her waist as she opened a carved chest and busied herself with bottles and boxes knives and needles when she was ready she broke off the barbed arrowhead and pulled out the shaft chanting in the singsong tongue of the lhazareen she heated a flagon of wine to boiling on the brazier and poured it over his wounds khal drogo cursed her but he did not move she bound the arrow wound with a plaster of wet leaves and turned to the gash on his breast smearing it with a pale green paste before she pulled the flap of skin back in place the khal ground his teeth together and swallowed a scream the godswife took out a silver needle and a bobbin of silk thread and began to close the flesh when she was done she painted the skin with red ointment covered it with more leaves and bound the breast in a ragged piece of lambskin you must say the prayers i give you and keep the lambskin in place for ten days and ten nights she said there will be fever and itching and a great scar when the healing is done khal drogo sat bells ringing i sing of my scars sheep woman he flexed his arm and scowled drink neither wine nor the milk of the poppy she cautioned him pain you will have but you must keep your body strong to fight the poison spirits i am khal drogo said i spit on pain and drink what i like cohollo bring my vest the older man hastened off before dany said to the ugly lhazareen woman i heard you speak of birthing songs i know every secret of the bloody bed silver lady nor have i ever lost a babe mirri maz duur replied page my time is near dany said i would have you attend me when he comes if you would khal drogo laughed moon of my life you do not ask a slave you tell her she will do as you command he jumped down from the altar come my blood the stallions call this place is ashes it is time to ride haggo followed the khal from the temple but qotho lingered long enough to favor mirri maz duur with a stare remember maegi as the khal fares so shall you as you say rider the woman answered him gathering up her jars and bottles the great shepherd guards the flock tyrion n a hill overlooking the kingsroad a long trestle table of roughhewn pine had been erected beneath an elm tree and covered with a golden cloth there beside his pavilion lord tywin took his evening meal with his chief knights and lords bannermen his great crimsonandgold standard waving overhead from a lofty pike tyrion arrived late saddlesore and sour all too vividly aware of how amusing he must look as he waddled up the slope to his father the days march had been long and tiring he thought he might get quite drunk tonight it was twilight and the air was alive with drifting fireflies the cooks were serving the meat course five suckling pigs skin seared and crackling a different fruit in every mouth the smell made his mouth water my pardons he began taking his place on the bench beside his uncle perhaps id best charge you with burying our dead tyrion lord tywin said if you are as late to battle as you are to table the fighting will all be done by the time you arrive oh surely you can save me a peasant or two father tyrion replied not too many i wouldnt want to be greedy he filled his wine cup and watched a serving man carve into the pig the crisp skin crackled under his knife and hot juice ran from the meat it was the loveliest sight tyrion had seen in ages ser addams outriders say the stark host has moved south from the twins his father reported as his trencher was filled with slices of pork lord freys levies have joined them they are likely no more than a days march north of us please father tyrion said im about to eat does the thought of facing the stark boy unman you tyrion your brother jaime would be eager to come to grips with him id sooner come to grips with that pig robb stark is not half so tender and he never smelled as good page lord lefford the sour bird who had charge of their stores and supplies leaned forward i hope your savages do not share your reluctance else weve wasted our good steel on them my savages will put your steel to excellent use my lord tyrion replied when he had told lefford he needed arms and armor to equip the three hundred men ulf had fetched down out of the foothills you would have thought hed asked the man to turn his virgin daughters over to their pleasure lord lefford frowned i saw that great hairy one today the one who insisted that he must have two battleaxes the heavy black steel ones with twin crescent blades shagga likes to kill with either hand tyrion said as a trencher of steaming pork was laid in front of him he still had that woodaxe of his strapped to his back shagga is of the opinion that three axes are even better than two tyrion reached a thumb and forefinger into the salt dish and sprinkled a healthy pinch over his meat ser kevan leaned forward we had a thought to put you and your wildlings in the vanguard when we come to battle ser kevan seldom had a thought that lord tywin had not had first tyrion had skewered a chunk of meat on the point of his dagger and brought it to his mouth now he lowered it the vanguard he repeated dubiously either his lord father had a new respect for tyrions abilities or hed decided to rid himself of his embarrassing get for good tyrion had the gloomy feeling he knew which they seem ferocious enough ser kevan said ferocious tyrion realized he was echoing his uncle like a trained bird his father watched judging him weighing every word let me tell you how ferocious they are last night a moon brother stabbed a stone crow over a sausage so today as we made camp three stone crows seized the man and opened his throat for him perhaps they were hoping to get the sausage back i couldnt say bronn managed to keep shagga from chopping off the dead mans cock which was fortunate but even so ulf is demanding blood money which conn and shagga refuse to pay when soldiers lack discipline the fault lies with their lord commander his father said his brother jaime had always been able to make men follow him eagerly and die for him if need be tyrion lacked that gift he bought loyalty with gold and compelled obedience with his name a bigger man would be able to put the fear in them is that what youre saying my lord lord tywin lannister turned to his brother if my sons men will not obey his commands perhaps the vanguard is not the place for him no doubt he would be more comfortable in the rear guarding our baggage train do me no kindnesses father he said angrily if you have no other command to offer me ill lead your van page lord tywin studied his dwarf son i said nothing about command you will serve under ser gregor tyrion took one bite of pork chewed a moment and spit it out angrily i find i am not hungry after all he said climbing awkwardly off the bench pray excuse me my lords lord tywin inclined his head dismissing him tyrion turned and walked away he was conscious of their eyes on his back as he waddled down the hill a great gust of laughter went up from behind him but he did not look back he hoped they all choked on their suckling pigs dusk had settled turning all the banners black the lannister camp sprawled for miles between the river and the kingsroad in amongst the men and the horses and the trees it was easy to get lost and irion did he passed a dozen great pavilions and a hundred cookfires fireflies drifted amongst the tents like wandering stars he caught the scent of garlic sausage spiced and savory so tempting it made his empty stomach growl away in the distance he heard voices raised in some bawdy song a giggling woman raced past him naked beneath a dark cloak her drunken pursuer stumbling over tree roots farther on two spearmen faced each other across a little trickle of a stream practicing their thrust andparry in the fading light their chests bare and slick with sweat no one looked at him no one spoke to him no one paid him any mind he was surrounded by men sworn to house lannister a vast host twenty thousand strong and yet he was alone when he heard the deep rumble of shaggas laughter booming through the dark he followed it to the stone crows in their small corner of the night conn son of coratt waved a tankard of ale tyrion halftnan come sit by our fire share meat with the stone crows we have an ox i can see that conn son of coratt the huge red carcass was suspended over a roaring fire skewered on a spit the size of a small tree no doubt it was a small tree blood and grease dripped down into the flames as two stone crows turned the meat i thank you send for me when the ox is cooked from the look of it that might even be before the battle he walked on each clan had its own cookfire black ears did not eat with stone crows stone crows did not eat with moon brothers and no one ate with burned men the modest tent he had coaxed out of lord leffords stores had been erected in the center of the four fires tyrion found bronn sharing a skin of wine with the new servants lord tywin had sent him a groom and a body servant to see to his needs and even insisted he take a squire they were seated around the embers of a small cookfire a girl was with them slim darkhaired no more than eighteen by the look of her tyrion studied her face for a moment before he spied fishbones in the ashes what did you eat trout mlord said his groom bronn caught them trout he thought suckling pig damn my father he stared mournfully at the bones his belly rumbling his squire a boy with the unfortunate name of podrick payne swallowed whatever he had been about to say the lad was a distant cousin to ser ilyn payne the kings headsman and almost as quiet although not for want of a tongue tyrion had made him stick it out once just to be certain definitely a tongue he had said someday you must learn to use it page at the moment he did not have the patience to try and coax a thought out of the lad whom he suspected had been inflicted on him as a cruel jape tyrion turned his attention back to the girl is this her he asked bronn she rose gracefully and looked down at him from the lofty height of five feet or more it is mlord and she can speak for herself if it please you he cocked his head to one side i am tyrion of house lannister men call me the imp my mother named me shae men call me often bronn laughed and tyrion had to smile into the tent shae if you would be so kind he lifted the flap and held it for her inside he knelt to light a candle the life of a soldier was not without certain compensations wherever you have a camp you are certain to have camp followers at the end of the days march tyrion had sent bronn back to find him a likely whore i would prefer one who is reasonably young with as pretty a face as you can find he had said if she has washed sometime this year i shall be glad if she hasnt wash her be certain that you tell her who i am and warn her of what i am jyck had not always troubled to do that there was a look the girls got in their eyes sometimes when they first beheld the lordling theyd been hired to pleasure a took that tyrion lannister did not ever care to see again he lifted the candle and looked her over bronn had done well enough she was doeeyed and slim with small firm breasts and a smile that was by turns shy insolent and wicked he liked that shall i take my gown off mlord she asked in good time are you a maiden shae if it please you mlord she said demurely what would please me would be the truth of you girl aye but that will cost you double tyrion decided they would get along splendidly i am a lannister gold i have in plenty and youll find me generous but ill want more from you than what youve got between your legs though ill want that too youll share my tent pour my wine laugh at my jests rub the ache from my legs after each days ride and whether i keep you a day or a year for so long as we are together you will take no other men into your bed fair enough she reached down to the hem of her thin roughspun gown and pulled it up over her head in one smooth motion tossing it aside there was nothing underneath but shae if he dont put down that candle mord will burn his fingers tyrion put down the candle took her hand in his and pulled her gently to him she bent to kiss him her mouth tasted of honey and cloves and her fingers were deft and practiced as they found the fastenings of his clothes page when he entered her she welcomed him with whispered endearments and small shuddering gasps of pleasure tyrion suspected her delight was feigned but she did it so well that it did not matter that much truth he did not crave he had needed her tyrion realized afterward as she lay quietly in his arms her or someone like her it had been nigh on a year since hed lain with a woman since before he had set out for winterfell in company with his brother and king robert he could well die on the morrow or the day after and if he did he would sooner go to his grave thinking of shae than of his lord father lysa arryn or the lady catelyn stark he could feel the softness of her breasts pressed against his arm as she lay beside him that was a good feeling a song filled his head softly quietly he began to whistle whats that mlord shae murmured against him nothing he told her a song i learned as a boy thats all go to sleep sweetling when her eyes were closed and her breathing deep and steady tyrion slid out from beneath her gently so as not to disturb her sleep naked he crawled outside stepped over his squire and walked around behind his tent to make water bronn was seated crosslegged under a chestnut tree near where theyd tied the horses he was honing the edge of his sword wide awake the sellsword did not seem to sleep like other men where did you find her tyrion asked him as he pissed i took her from a knight the man was loath to give her up but your name changed his thinking somewhat that and my dirk at his throat splendid tyrion said dryly shaking off the last drops i seem to recall saying find me a whore not make me an enemy the pretty ones were all claimed bronn said ill be pleased to take her back if youd prefer a toothless drab tyrion limped closer to where he sat my lord father would call that insolence and send you to the mines for impertinence good for me youre not your father bronn replied i saw one with boils all over her nose would you like her what and break your heart tyrion shot back i shall keep shae did you perchance note the name of this knight you took her from id rather not have him beside me in the battle bronn rose catquick and catgraceful turning his sword in his hand youll have me beside you in the battle dwarf tyrion nodded the night air was warm on his bare skin see that i survive this battle and you can name your reward page bronn tossed the longsword from his right hand to his left and tried a cut whod want to kill the likes of you my lord father for one hes put me in the van id do the same a small man with a big shield youll give the archers fits i find you oddly cheering tyrion said i must be mad bronn sheathed his sword beyond a doubt when tyrion returned to his tent shae rolled onto her elbow and murmured sleepily i woke and mlord was gone miord is back now he slid in beside her her hand went between his stunted legs and found him hard yes he is she whispered stroking him he asked her about the man bronn had taken her from and she named the minor retainer of an insignificant lordling you need not fear his like mlord the girl said her fingers busy at his cock he is a small man and what am pray tyrion asked her a giant oh yes she purred my giant of lannister she mounted him then and for a time she almost made him believe it tyrion went to sleep smiling and woke in darkness to the blare of trumpets shae was shaking him by the shoulder miord she whispered wake up mlord im frightened groggy he sat up and threw back the blanket the horns called through the night wild and urgent a cry that said huny huny huny he heard shouts the clatter of spears the whicker of horses though nothing yet that spoke to him of fighting my lord fathers trumpets he said battle assembly i thought stark was yet a days march away shae shook her head lost her eyes were wide and white groaning tyrion lurched to his feet and pushed his way outside shouting for his squire wisps of pale fog drifted through the night long white fingers off the river men and horses blundered through the predawn chill saddles were being cinched wagons loaded fires extinguished the trumpets blew again huny huny huny knights vaulted onto snorting coursers while menatarms buckled their sword belts as they ran when he found pod the boy was snoring softly tyrion gave him a sharp poke in the ribs with his toe my armor he said and be quick about it bronn came trotting out of the mists already armored and ahorse wearing his battered halfhelm do you know whats happened tyrion asked him the stark boy stole a march on us bronn said he crept down the kingsroad in the night and now his host is less than a mile north of here forming up in battle array page huny the trumpets called huny huny huny see that the clansmen are ready to ride tyrion ducked back inside his tent where are my clothes he barked at shae there no the leather damn it yes bring me my boots by the time he was dressed his squire had laid out his armor such that it was tyrion owned a fine suit of heavy plate expertly crafted to fit his misshapen body alas it was safe at casterly rock and he was not he had to make do with oddments assembled from lord leffords wagons mail hauberk and coif a dead knights gorget lobstered greaves and gauntlets and pointed steel boots some of it was ornate some plain not a bit of it matched or fit as it should his breastplate was meant for a bigger man for his oversize head they found a huge bucketshaped greathelm topped with a footlong triangular spike shae helped pod with the buckles and clasps if i die weep for me tyrion told the whore how will you know youll be dead ill know i believe you would shae lowered the greathelm down over his head and pod fastened it to his gorget tyrion buckled on his belt heavy with the weight of shortsword and dirk by then his groom had brought up his mount a formidable brown courser armored as heavily as he was he needed help to mount he felt as though he weighed a thousand stone pod handed him up his shield a massive slab of heavy ironwood banded with steel lastly they gave him his battleaxe shae stepped back and looked him over nilord looks fearsome nilord looks a dwarf in mismatched armor tyrion answered sourly but i thank you for the kindness podrick should the battle go against us see the lady safely home he saluted her with his axe wheeled his horse about and trotted off his stomach was a hard knot so tight it pained him behind his servants hurriedly began to strike his tent pale crimson fingers fanned out to the east as the first rays of the sun broke over the horizon the western sky was a deep purple speckled with stars tyrion wondered whether this was the last sunrise he would ever see and whether wondering was a mark of cowardice did his brother jaime ever contemplate death before a battle a warhorn sounded in the far distance a deep mournful note that chilled the soul the clansmen climbed onto their scrawny mountain horses shouting curses and rude jokes several appeared to be drunk the rising sun was burning off the drifting tendrils of fog as tyrion led them off what grass the horses had left was heavy with dew as if some passing god had scattered a bag of diamonds over the earth the mountain men fell in behind him each clan arrayed behind its own leaders in the dawn light the army of lord tywin lannister unfolded like an iron rose thorns gleaming his uncle would lead the center ser kevan had raised his standards above the kingsroad quivers hanging from their belts the foot archers arrayed themselves into three long lines to east and west of the road page and stood calmly stringing their bows between them pikemen formed squares behind were rank on rank of menatarms with spear and sword and axe three hundred heavy horse surrounded ser kevan and the lords bannermen lefford lydden and serrett with all their sworn retainers the right wing was all cavalry some four thousand men heavy with the weight of their armor more than three quarters of the knights were there massed together like a great steel fist ser addam marbrand had the command tyrion saw his banner unfurl as his standardbearer shook it out a burning tree orange and smoke behind him flew ser flements purple unicorn the brindled boar of crakehall the bantam rooster of swyft and more his lord father took his place on the hill where he had slept around him the reserve assembled a huge force half mounted and half foot five thousand strong lord tywin almost always chose to command the reserve he would take the high ground and watch the battle unfold below him committing his forces when and where they were needed most even from afar his lord father was resplendent tywin lannisters battle armor put his son jaimes gilded suit to shame his greatcloak was sewn from countless layers of clothofgold so heavy that it barely stirred even when he charged so large that its drape covered most of his stallions hindquarters when he took the saddle no ordinary clasp would suffice for such a weight so the greatcloak was held in place by a matched pair of miniature lionesses crouching on his shoulders as if poised to spring their mate a male with a magnificent mane reclined atop lord tywins greathelm one paw raking the air as he roared all three lions were wrought in gold with ruby eyes his armor was heavy steel plate enameled in a dark crimson greaves and gauntlets inlaid with ornate gold scrollwork his rondels were golden sunbursts all his fastenings were gilded and the red steel was burnished to such a high sheen that it shone like fire in the light of the rising sun tyrion could hear the rumble of the foemens drums now he remembered robb stark as he had last seen him in his fathers high seat in the great hall of winterfell a sword naked and shining in his hands he remembered how the direwolves had come at him out of the shadows and suddenly he could see them again snarling and snapping teeth bared in his face would the boy bring his wolves to war with him the thought made him uneasy the northerners would be exhausted after their long sleepless march tyrion wondered what the boy had been thinking did he think to take them unawares while they slept small chance of that whatever else might be said of him tywin lannister was no mans fool the van was massing on the left he saw the standard first three black dogs on a yellow field ser gregor sat beneath it mounted on the biggest horse tyrion had ever seen bronn took one look at him and grinned always follow a big man into battle tyrion threw him a hard look and why is that they make such splendid targets that one hell draw the eyes of every bowman on the field laughing tyrion regarded the mountain with fresh eyes i confess i had not considered it in that light clegane had no splendor about him his armor was steel plate dull grey scarred by hard use and page showing neither sigil nor ornament he was pointing men into position with his blade a twohanded greatsword that ser gregor waved about with one hand as a lesser man might wave a dagger any man runs ill cut him down myself he was roaring when he caught sight of tyrion imp take the left hold the river if you can the left of the left to turn their flank the starks would need horses that could run on water tyrion led his men toward the riverbank look he shouted pointing with his axe the river a blanket of pale mist still clung to the surface of the water the murky green current swirling past underneath the shallows were muddy and choked with reeds that river is ours whatever happens keep close to the water never lose sight of it let no enemy come between us and our river if they dirty our waters hack off their cocks and feed them to the fishes shagga had an axe in either hand he smashed them together and made them ring halfman he shouted other stone crows picked up the cry and the black ears and moon brothers as well the burned men did not shout but they rattled their swords and spears halfman ha ifm a n ha fm a n tyrion turned his courser in a circle to look over the field the ground was rolling and uneven here soft and muddy near the river rising in a gentle slope toward the kingsroad stony and broken beyond it to the cast a few trees spotted the hillsides but most of the land had been cleared and planted his heart pounded in his chest in time to the drums and under his layers of leather and steel his brow was cold with sweat he watched ser gregor as the mountain rode up and down the line shouting and gesticulating this wing too was all cavalry but where the right was a mailed fist of knights and heavy lancers the vanguard was made up of the sweepings of the west mounted archers in leather jerkins a swarming mass of undisciplined freeriders and sellswords fieldhands on plow horses armed with scythes and their fathers rusted swords halftrained boys from the stews of lannisport and tyrion and his mountain clansmen crow food bronn muttered beside him giving voice to what tyrion had left unsaid he could only nod had his lord father taken leave of his senses no pikes too few bowmen a bare handful of knights the illarmed and unarmored commanded by an unthinking brute who led with his rage how could his father expect this travesty of a battle to hold his left he had no time to think about it the drums were so near that the beat crept under his skin and set his hands to twitching bronn drew his longsword and suddenly the enemy was there before them boiling over the tops of the hills advancing with measured tread behind a wall of shields and pikes gods be damned look at them all tyrion thought though he knew his father had more men on the field their captains led them on armored warhorses standardbearers riding alongside with their banners he glimpsed the bull moose of the hornwoods the karstark sunburst lord cerwyns battleaxe and the mailed fist of the glovers and the twin towers of frey blue on grey so much for his fathers certainty that lord walder would not bestir himself the white of house stark was seen everywhere the grey direwolves seeming to run and leap as the banners swirled and streamed from the high staffs ere is the boy tyrion wondered a warhorn blew haroooooooooooooooooooooooo it cried its voice as long and low and chilling as a cold wind from the north the lannister trumpets answered dada dada dadaaaaaaaaa brazen and defiant yet it seemed to tyrion that they sounded somehow smaller more anxious he could feel a fluttering in his bowels a queasy liquid feeling he hoped he was not going to die sick page as the horns died away a hissing filled the air a vast flight of arrows arched up from his right where the archers stood flanking the road the northerners broke into a run shouting as they came but the lannister arrows fell on them like hail hundreds of arrows thousands and shouts turned to screams as men stumbled and went down by then a second flight was in the air and the archers were fitting a third arrow to their bowstrings the trumpets blared again dadaaa dadaaa dada dada dadaaaaaaa ser gregor waved his huge sword and bellowed a command and a thousand other voices screamed back at him tyrion put his spurs to his horse and added one more voice to the cacophony and the van surged forward the river he shouted at his clansmen as they rode remember hew to the river he was still leading when they broke a canter until chella gave a bloodcurdling shriek and galloped past him and shagga howled and followed the clansmen charged after them leaving tyrion in their dust a crescent of enemy spearmen had formed ahead a double hedgehog bristling with steel waiting behind tall oaken shields marked with the sunburst of karstark gregor clegane was the first to reach them leading a wedge of armored veterans half the horses shied at the last second breaking their charge before the row of spears the others died sharp steel points ripping through their chests tyrion saw a dozen men go down the mountains stallion reared lashing out with ironshod hooves as a barbed spearhead raked across his neck maddened the beast lunged into the ranks spears thrust at him from every side but the shield wall broke beneath his weight the northerners stumbled away from the animals death throes as his horse fell snorting blood and biting with his last red breath the mountain rose untouched laying about him with his twohanded greatsword shagga went bursting through the gap before the shields could close other stone crows hard behind him tyrion shouted burned men moon brothers after me but most of them were ahead of him he glimpsed timett son of timett vault free as his mount died under him in full stride saw a moon brother impaled on a karstark spear watched conns horse shatter a mans ribs with a kick a flight of arrows descended on them where they came from he could not say but they fell on stark and lannister alike rattling off armor or finding flesh tyrion lifted his shield and hid beneath it the hedgehog was crumbling the northerners reeling back under the impact of the mounted assault tyrion saw shagga catch a spearman full in the chest as the fool came on at a run saw his axe shear through mail and leather and muscle and lungs the man was dead on his feet the axehead lodged in his breast yet shagga rode on cleaving a shield in two with his lefthand battleaxe while the corpse was bouncing and stumbling bonelessly along on his right finally the dead man slid off shagga smashed the two axes together and roared by then the enemy was on him and tyrions battle shrunk to the few feet of ground around his horse a manatarms thrust at his chest and his axe lashed out knocking the spear aside the man danced back for another try but tyrion spurred his horse and rode right over him bronn was surrounded by three foes but he lopped the head off the first spear that came at him and raked his blade across a second mans face on his backslash a thrown spear came hurtling at tyrion from the left and lodged in his shield with a woody chunk he page wheeled and raced after the thrower but the man raised his own shield over his head tyrion circled around him raining axe blows down on the wood chips of oak went flying until the northerner lost his feet and slipped failing flat on his back with his shield on top of him he was below the reach of tyrions axe and it was too much bother to dismount so he left him there and rode after another man taking him from behind with a sweeping downcut that sent a jolt of impact up his arm that won him a moments respite reining up he looked for the river there it was off to the right somehow he had gotten turned around a burned man rode past slumped against his horse a spear had entered his belly and come out through his back he was past any help but when tyrion saw one of the northerners run up and make a grab for his reins he charged his quarry met him sword in hand he was tall and spare wearing a long chainmail hauberk and gauntlets of lobstered steel but hed lost his helm and blood ran down into his eyes from a gash across his forehead tyrion aimed a swipe at his face but the tall man slammed it aside dwarf he screamed die he turned in a circle as tyrion rode around him hacking at his head and shoulders steel rang on steel and tyrion soon realized that the tall man was quicker and stronger than he was where in the seven hells was bronn die the man grunted chopping at him savagely tyrion barely got his shield up in time and the wood seemed to explode inward under the force of the blow the shattered pieces fell away from his arm die the swordsman bellowed shoving in close and whanging tyrion across the temple so hard his head rang the blade made a hideous scraping sound as he drew it back over the steel the tall man grinned until tyrions destrier bit quick as a snake laying his cheek bare to the bone then he screamed tyrion buried his axe in his head you die he told him and he did as he wrenched the blade free he heard a shout eddard a voice rang out for eddard and winterfell the knight came thundering down on him swinging the spiked ball of a morningstar around his head their warhorses slammed together before tyrion could so much as open his mouth to shout for bronn his right elbow exploded with pain as the spikes punched through the thin metal around the joint his axe was gone as fast as that he clawed for his sword but the morningstar was circling again coming at his face a sickening crunch and he was falling he did not recall hitting the ground but when he looked up there was only sky above him he rolled onto his side and tried to find his feet but pain shuddered through him and the world throbbed the knight who had felled him drew up above him tyrion the imp he boomed down you are mine do you yield lannister yes tyrion thought but the word caught in his throat he made a croaking sound and fought his way to his knees fumbling for a weapon his sword his dirk anything do you yield the knight loomed overhead on his armored warhorse man and horse both seemed immense the spiked ball swung in a lazy circle tyrions hands were numb his vision blurred his scabbard empty yield or die the knight declared his flail whirling faster and faster tyrion lurched to his feet driving his head into the horses belly the animal gave a hideous scream and reared it tried to twist away from the agony a shower of blood and viscera poured down over tyrions face and the horse fell like an avalanche the next he knew his visor was packed with mud and something was crushing his foot he wriggled free his throat so tight he could scarce talk yield he managed to croak faintly page yes a voice moaned thick with pain tyrion scraped the mud off his helm so he could see again the horse had fallen away from him onto its rider the knights leg was trapped the arm hed used to break his fall twisted at a grotesque angle yield he repeated fumbling at his belt with his good hand he drew a sword and flung it at tyrions feet i yield my lord dazed the dwarf knelt and lifted the blade pain hammered through his elbow when he moved his arm the battle seemed to have moved beyond him no one remained on his part of the field save a large number of corpses ravens were already circling and landing to feed he saw that ser kevan had brought up his center in support of the van his huge mass of pikemen had pushed the northerners back against the hills they were struggling on the slopes pikes thrusting against another wall of shields these oval and reinforced with iron studs as he watched the air filled with arrows again and the men behind the oak wall crumbled beneath the murderous fire i believe you are losing ser he told the knight under the horse the man made no reply the sound of hooves coming up behind him made him whirl though he could scarcely lift the sword he held for the agony in his elbow brorm reined up and looked down on him small use you turned out to be tyrion told him it would seem you did well enough on your own bronn answered youve lost the spike off your helm though tyrion groped at the top of the greathelm the spike had snapped off clean i havent lost it i know just where it is do you see my horse by the time they found it the trumpets had sounded again and lord tywins reserve came sweeping up along the river tyrion watched his father fly past the crimsonandgold banner of lannister rippling over his head as he thundered across the field five hundred knights surrounded him sunlight flashing off the points of their lances the remnants of the stark lines shattered like glass beneath the hammer of their charge with his elbow swollen and throbbing inside his armor tyrion made no attempt to join the slaughter he and bronn went looking for his men many he found among the dead ulf son of umar lay in a pool of congealing blood his arm gone at the elbow a dozen of his moon brothers sprawled around him shagga was slumped beneath a tree riddled with arrows conns head in his lap tyrion thought they were both dead but as he dismounted shagga opened his eyes and said they have killed conn son of coratt handsome conn had no mark but for the red stain over his breast where the spear thrust had killed him when bronn pulled shagga to his feet the big man seemed to notice the arrows for the first time he plucked them out one by one cursing the holes they had made in his layers of mail and leather and yowling like a babe at the few that had buried themselves in his flesh chella daughter of cheyk rode up as they were yanking arrows out of shagga and showed them four ears she had taken timett they discovered looting the bodies of the slain with his burned men of the three hundred clansmen who had ridden to battle behind tyrion lannister perhaps half had survived he left the living to look after the dead sent bronn to take charge of his captive knight and went alone in search of his father lord tywin was seated by the river sipping wine from a jeweled cup as his squire undid the fastenings on his breastplate a fine victory ser kevan said when he saw tyrion your wild page men fought well his fathers eyes were on him pale green flecked with gold so cool they gave tyrion a chill did that surprise you father he asked did it upset your plans we were supposed to be butchered were we not lord tywin drained his cup his face expressionless i put the least disciplined men on the left yes i anticipated that they would break robb stark is a green boy more like to be brave than wise id hoped that if he saw our left collapse he might plunge into the gap eager for a rout once he was fully committed ser kevans pikes would wheel and take him in the flank driving him into the river while i brought up the reserve and you thought it best to place me in the midst of this carnage yet keep me ignorant of your plans a feigned rout is less convincing his father said and i am not inclined to trust my plans to a man who consorts with sellswords and savages a pity my savages ruined your dance tyrion pulled off his steel gauntlet and let it fall to the ground wincing at the pain that stabbed up his arm the stark boy proved more cautious than i expected for one of his years lord tywin admitted but a victory is a victory you appear to be wounded tyrions right arm was soaked with blood good of you to notice father he said through clenched teeth might i trouble you to send for your maesters unless you relish the notion of having a onearmed dwarf for a son an urgent shout of lord tywin turned his fathers head before he could reply tywin lannister rose to his feet as ser addam marbrand leapt down off his courser the horse was lathered and bleeding from the mouth ser addam dropped to one knee a rangy man with dark copper hair that fell to his shoulders armored in burnished bronzed steel with the fiery tree of his house etched black on his breastplate my liege we have taken some of their commanders lord cerwyn ser wylis manderly harrion karstark four freys lord hornwood is dead and i fear roose bolton has escaped us and the boy lord tywin asked ser addam hesitated the stark boy was not with them my lord they say he crossed at the twins with the great part of his horse riding hard for riverrun a green boy tyrion remembered more like to be brave than wise he would have laughed if he hadnt hurt so much catelyn the woods were full of whispers page moonlight winked on the tumbling waters of the stream below as it wound its rocky way along the floor of the valley beneath the trees warhorses whickered softly and pawed at the moist leafy ground while men made nervous jests in hushed voices now and again she heard the chink of spears the faint metallic slither of chain mail but even those sounds were muffled it should not be long now my lady hallis mollen said he had asked for the honor of protecting her in the battle to come it was his right as winterfells captain of guards and robb had not refused it to him she had thirty men around her charged to keep her unharmed and see her safely home to winterfell if the fighting went against them robb had wanted fifty catelyn had insisted that ten would be enough that he would need every sword for the fight they made their peace at thirty neither happy with it it will come when it comes catelyn told him when it came she knew it would mean death hals death perhaps or hers or robbs no one was safe no life was certain catelyn was content to wait to listen to the whispers in the woods and the faint music of the brook to feel the warm wind in her hair she was no stranger to waiting after all her men had always made her wait watch for me little cat her father would always tell her when he rode off to court or fair or battle and she would standing patiently on the battlements of riverrun as the waters of the red fork and the tumblestone flowed by he did not always come when he said he would and days would ofttimes pass as catelyn stood her vigil peering out between crenels and through arrow loops until she caught a glimpse of lord hoster on his old brown gelding trotting along the rivershore toward the landing did you watch for me hed ask when he bent to bug her did you little cat brandon stark had bid her wait as well i shall not be long my lady he had vowed we will be wed on my return yet when the day came at last it was his brother eddard who stood beside her in the sept ned had lingered scarcely a fortnight with his new bride before he too had ridden off to war with promises on his lips at least he had left her with more than words he had given her a son nine moons had waxed and waned and robb had been born in riverrun while his father still warred in the south she had brought him forth in blood and pain not knowing whether ned would ever see him her son he had been so small and now it was for robb that she waited for robb and for jaime lannister the gilded knight who men said had never learned to wait at all the kingslayer is restless and quick to anger her uncle brynden had told robb and he had wagered their lives and their best hope of victory on the truth of what he said if robb was frightened he gave no sign of it catelyn watched her son as he moved among the men touching one on the shoulder sharing a jest with another helping a third to gentle an anxious horse his armor clinked softly when he moved only his head was bare catelyn watched a breeze stir his auburn hair so like her own and wondered when her son had grown so big fifteen and near as tall as she was let him grow taller she asked the gods let him know sixteen and twenty and fifty let him grow as tall as his father and hold his own son in his arms please please please as she watched him this tall young man with the new beard and the direwolf prowling at his heels all she could see was the babe they page had laid at her breast at riverrun so long ago the night was warm but the thought of riverrun was enough to make her shiver where are they she wondered could her uncle have been wrong so much rested on the truth of what he had told them robb had given the blackfish three hundred picked men and sent them ahead to screen his march jaime does not know ser brynden said when he rode back ill stake my life on that no bird has reached him my archers have seen to that weve seen a few of his outriders but those that saw us did not live to tell of it he ought to have sent out more he does not know how large is his host her son asked twelve thousand foot scattered around the castle in three separate camps with the rivers between her uncle said with the craggy smile she remembered so well there is no other way to besiege riverrun yet still that will be their undoing two or three thousand horse the kingslayer has us three to one said galbart glover true enough ser brynden said yet there is one thing ser jaime lacks yes robb asked patience their host was greater than it had been when they left the twins lord jason mallister had brought his power out from seagard to join them as they swept around the headwaters of the blue fork and galloped south and others had crept forth as well hedge knights and small lords and masterless menatarms who had fled north when her brother edmures army was shattered beneath the walls of riverrun they had driven their horses as hard as they dared to reach this place before jaime lannister had word of their coming and now the hour was at hand catelyn watched her son mount up yvar frey held his horse for him lord walders son two years older than robb and ten years younger and more anxious he strapped robbs shield in place and handed up his helm when he lowered it over the face she loved so well a tall young knight sat on his grey stallion where her son had been it was dark among the trees where the moon did not reach when robb turned his head to look at her she could see only black inside his visor i must ride down the line mother he told her father says you should let the men see you before a battle go then she said let them see you it will give them courage robb said and who will give me courage she wondered yet she kept her silence and made herself smile for him robb turned the big grey stallion and walked him slowly away from her grey wind shadowing his steps behind him his battle guard formed up when hed forced catelyn to accept her protectors she had insisted that he be guarded as well and the lords bannermen had agreed many of their sons had clamored for the honor of riding with the young wolf as they had taken to calling him torrhen karstark and his brother eddard were page among his thirty and patrek mallister smalljon umber daryn hornwood theon greyjoy no less than five of walder freys vast brood along with older men like ser wendel manderly and robin flint one of his companions was even a woman dacey mormont lady maeges eldest daughter and heir to bear island a lanky sixfooter who had been given a morningstar at an age when most girls were given dolls some of the other lords muttered about that but catelyn would not listen to their complaints this is not about the honor of your houses she told them this is about keeping my son alive and whole and if it comes to that she wondered will thiny be enough will six thousand be enough a bird called faintly in the distance a high sharp trill that felt like an icy hand on catelyns neck another bird answered a third a fourth she knew their call well enough from her years at winterfell snow shrikes sometimes you saw them in the deep of winter when the godswood was white and still they were northern birds they are coming catelyn thought theyre coming my lady hal mollen whispered he was always a man for stating the obvious gods be with us she nodded as the woods grew still around them in the quiet she could hear them far off yet moving closer the tread of many horses the rattle of swords and spears and armor the murmur of human voices with here a laugh and there a curse eons seemed to come and go the sounds grew louder she heard more laughter a shouted command splashing as they crossed and recrossed the little stream a horse snorted a man swore and then at last she saw him only for an instant framed between the branches of the trees as she looked down at the valley floor yet she knew it was him even at a distance ser jaime lannister was unmistakable the moonlight had silvered his armor and the gold of his hair and turned his crimson cloak to black he was not wearing a helm he was there and he was gone again his silvery armor obscured by the trees once more others came behind him long columns of them knights and sworn swords and freeriders three quarters of the lannister horse he is no man for sitting in a tent while his carpenters build siege towers ser brynden had promised he has ridden out with his knights thrice already to chase down raiders or storm a stubborn holdfast nodding robb had studied the map her uncle had drawn him ned had taught him to read maps raid him here he said pointing a few hundred men no more tully banners when he comes after you we will be waitinghis finger moved an inch to the lefthere here was a hush in the night moonlight and shadows a thick carpet of dead leaves underfoot densely wooded ridges sloping gently down to the streambed the underbrush thinning as the ground fell away here was her son on his stallion glancing back at her one last time and lifting his sword in salute page here was the call of maege mormonts warhorn a long low blast that rolled down the valley from the east to tell them that the last of jaimes riders had entered the trap and grey wind threw back his head and howled the sound seemed to go right through catelyn stark and she found herself shivering it was a terrible sound a frightening sound yet there was music in it too for a second she felt something like pity for the lannisters below so this is what death sounds like she thought haaroooooooooooooooooooooooo came the answer from the far ridge as the greatjon winded his own horn to east and west the trumpets of the mallisters and freys blew vengeance north where the valley narrowed and bent like a cocked elbow lord karstarks warhorns added their own deep mournful voices to the dark chorus men were shouting and horses rearing in the stream below the whispering wood let out its breath all at once as the bowmen robb had hidden in the branches of the trees let fly their arrows and the night erupted with the screams of men and horses all around her the riders raised their lances and the dirt and leaves that had buried the cruet bright points fell away to reveal the gleam of sharpened steel wintepll she heard robb shout as the arrows sighed again he moved away from her at a trot leading his men downhill catelyn sat on her horse unmoving with hal mollen and her guard around her and she waited as she had waited before for brandon and ned and her father she was high on the ridge and the trees hid most of what was going on beneath her a heartbeat two four and suddenly it was as if she and her protectors were alone in the wood the rest were melted away into the green yet when she looked across the valley to the far ridge she saw the greatjons riders emerge from the darkness beneath the trees they were in a long line an endless line and as they burst from the wood there was an instant the smallest part of a heartbeat when all catelyn saw was the moonlight on the points of their lances as if a thousand willowisps were coming down the ridge wreathed in silver flame then she blinked and they were only men rushing down to kill or die afterward she could not claim she had seen the battle yet she could hear and the valley rang with echoes the crack of a broken lance the clash of swords the cries of lannister and winterfell and tully riverrun and tully when she realized there was no more to see she closed her eyes and listened the battle came alive around her she heard hoofbeats iron boots splashing in shallow water the woody sound of swords on oaken shields and the scrape of steel against steel the hiss of arrows the thunder of drums the terrified screaming of a thousand horses men shouted curses and begged for mercy and got it or not and lived or died the ridges seemed to play queer tricks with sound once she heard robbs voice as clear as if hed been standing at her side calling to me to me and she heard his direwolf snarling and growling heard the snap of those long teeth the tearing of flesh shrieks of fear and pain from man and horse alike was there only one wolf it was hard to be certain little by little the sounds dwindled and died until at last there was only the wolf as a red dawn broke in the east grey wind began to howl again robb came back to her on a different horse riding a piebald gelding in the place of the grey stallion he had taken down into the valley the wolfs head on his shield was slashed half to pieces raw wood page showing where deep gouges had been hacked in the oak but robb himself seemed unhurt yet when he came closer catelyn saw that his mailed glove and the sleeve of his surcoat were black with blood youre hurt she said robb lifted his hand opened and closed his fingers no he said this is torrhens blood perhaps or he shook his head i do not know a mob of men followed him up the slope dirty and dented and grinning with theon and the greatjon at their head between them they dragged ser jaime lannister they threw him down in front of her horse the kingslayer hal announced unnecessarily lannister raised his head lady stark he said from his knees blood ran down one cheek from a gash across his scalp but the pale light of dawn had put the glint of gold back in his hair i would offer you my sword but i seem to have mislaid it it is not your sword i want ser she told him give me my father and my brother edmure give me my daughters give me my lord husband i have mislaid them as well i fear a pity catelyn said coldly kill him robb theon greyjoy urged take his head off no her son answered peeling off his bloody glove hes more use alive than dead and my lord father never condoned the murder of prisoners after a battle a wise man jaime lannister said and honorable take him away and put him in irons catelyn said do as my lady mother says robb commanded and make certain theres a strong guard around him lord karstark will want his head on a pike that he will the greatjon agreed gesturing lannister was led away to be bandaged and chained why should lord karstark want him dead catelyn asked robb looked away into the woods with the same brooding look that ned often got he he killed them lord karstarks sons galbart glover explained both of them said robb torrhen and eddard and daryn hornwood as well no one can fault lannister on his courage glover said when he saw that he was lost he rallied his retainers and fought his way up the valley hoping to reach lord robb and cut him down and almost did page he mislaid his sword in eddard karstarks neck after he took torrhens hand off and split daryn hornwoods skull open robb said all the time he was shouting for me if they hadnt tried to stop him i should then be mourning in place of lord karstark catelyn said your men did what they were sworn to do robb they died protecting their liege lord grieve for them honor them for their valor but not now you have no time for grief you may have lopped the head off the snake but three quarters of the body is still coiled around my fathers castle we have won a battle not a war but such a battle said theon greyjoy eagerly my lady the realm has not seen such a victory since the field of fire i vow the lannisters lost ten men for every one of ours that fell weve taken close to a hundred knights captive and a dozen lords bannermen lord westerling lord banefort ser garth greenfield lord estren ser tytos brax mallor the dornishman and three lannisters besides jaime lord tywins own nephews two of his sisters sons and one of his dead brothers and lord tywin catelyn interrupted have you perchance taken lord tywin theon no greyjoy answered brought up short until you do this war is far from done robb raised his head and pushed his hair back out of his eyes my mother is right we still have riverrun daenerys the flies circled khal drogo slowly their wings buzzing a low thrum at the edge of hearing that filled dany with dread the sun was high and pitiless heat shimmered in waves off the stony outcrops of low hills a thin finger of sweat trickled slowly between danys swollen breasts the only sounds were the steady clop of their horses hooves the rhythmic tingle of the bells in drogos hair and the distant voices behind them dany watched the flies they were as large as bees gross purplish glistening the dothraki called them bloodflies they lived in marshes and stagnant pools sucked blood from man and horse alike and laid their eggs in the dead and dying drogo hated them whenever one came near him his hand would shoot out quick as a striking snake to close around it she had never seen him miss he would hold the fly inside his huge fist long enough to hear its frantic buzzing then his fingers would tighten and when he opened his hand again the fly would be only a red smear on his palm now one crept across the rump of his stallion and the horse gave an angry flick of its tail to brush it away the others flitted about drogo closer and closer the khal did not react his eyes were fixed on distant brown hills the reins loose in his hands beneath his painted vest a plaster of fig leaves and caked blue mud covered the wound on his page breast the herbwomen had made it for him mirri maz duurs poultice had itched and burned and he had torn it off six days ago cursing her for a maegi the mud plaster was more soothing and the herbwomen made him poppy wine as well hed been drinking it heavily these past three days when it was not poppy wine it was fermented mares milk or pepper beer yet he scarcely touched his food and he thrashed and groaned in the night dany could see how drawn his face had become rhaego was restless in her belly kicking like a stallion yet even that did not stir drogos interest as it had every morning her eyes found fresh lines of pain on his face when he woke from his troubled sleep and now this silence it was making her afraid since they had mounted up at dawn he had said not a word when she spoke she got no answer but a grunt and not even that much since midday one of the bloodflies landed on the bare skin of the khals shoulder another circling touched down on his neck and crept up toward his mouth khal drogo swayed in the saddle bells ringing as his stallion kept onward at a steady walking pace dany pressed her heels into her silver and rode closer my lord she said softly drogo my sunandstars he did not seem to hear the bloodfly crawled up under his drooping mustache and settled on his cheek in the crease beside his nose dany gasped drogo clumsily she reached over and touched his arm khal drogo reeled in the saddle tilted slowly and fell heavily from his horse the flies scattered for a heartbeat and then circled back to settle on him where he lay no dany said reining up heedless of her belly for once she scrambled off her silver and ran to him the grass beneath him was brown and dry drogo cried out in pain as dany knelt beside him his breath rattled harshly in his throat and he looked at her without recognition my horse he gasped dany brushed the flies off his chest smashing one as he would have his skin burned beneath her fingers the khals bloodriders had been following just behind them she heard haggo shout as they galloped up cohollo vaulted from his horse blood of my blood he said as he dropped to his knees the other two kept to their mounts no khal drogo groaned struggling in danys arms must ride ride no he fell from his horse haggo said staring down his broad face was impassive but his voice was leaden you must not say that dany told him we have ridden far enough today we will camp here here haggo looked around them the land was brown and sere inhospitable this is no camping ground it is not for a woman to bid us halt said qotho not even a khaleesi page we camp here dany repeated haggo tell them khal drogo commanded the halt if any ask why say to them that my time is near and i could not continue cohollo bring up the slaves they must put up the khals tent at once qotho you do not command me khaleesi qotho said find mirri maz duur she told him the godswife would be walking among the other lamb men in the long column of slaves bring her to me with her chest qotho glared down at her his eyes hard as flint the maegi he spat this i will not do you will dany said or when drogo wakes he will hear why you defied me furious qotho wheeled his stallion around and galloped off in anger but dany knew he would return with mirri maz duur however little he might like it the slaves erected khal drogos tent beneath a jagged outcrop of black rock whose shadow gave some relief from the heat of the afternoon sun even so it was stifling under the sandsilk as irri and doreah helped dany walk drogo inside thick patterned carpets had been laid down over the ground and pillows scattered in the corners eroeh the timid girl dany had rescued outside the mud walls of the lamb men set up a brazier they stretched drogo out on a woven mat no he muttered in the common tongue no no it was all he said all he seemed capable of saying doreah unhooked his medallion belt and stripped off his vest and leggings while jhiqui knelt by his feet to undo the laces of his riding sandals irri wanted to leave the tent flaps open to let in the breeze but dany forbade it she would not have any see drogo this way indelirium and weakness when her khas came up she posted them outside at guard admit no one without my leave she told jhogo no one eroeh stared fearfully at drogo where he lay he dies she whispered dany slapped her the khal cannot die he is the father of the stallion who mounts the world his hair has never been cut he still wears the bells his father gave him khaleesi jhiqui said he fell from his horse trembling her eyes full of sudden tears dany turned away from them he fell from his horse it was so she had seen it and the bloodriders and no doubt her handmaids and the men of her khas as well and how many more they could not keep it secret and dany knew what that meant a khal who could not ride could not rule and drogo had fallen from his horse we must bathe him she said stubbornly she must not allow herself to despair irri have the tub brought at once doreah eroeh find water cool water hes so hot he was a fire in human skin the slaves set up the heavy copper tub in the corner of the tent when doreah brought the first jar of water dany wet a length of silk to lay across drogos brow over the burning skin his eyes looked at her but he did not see when his lips opened no words escaped them only a moan where is mirri maz duur she demanded her patience rubbed raw with fear ootho will find her irri said page her handmaids filled the tub with tepid water that stank of sulfur sweetening it with jars of bitter oil and handfuls of crushed mint leaves while the bath was being prepared dany knelt awkwardly beside her lord husband her belly great with their child within she undid his braid with anxious fingers as she had on the night hed taken her for the first time beneath the stars his bells she laid aside carefully one by one he would want them again when he was well she told herself a breath of air entered the tent as aggo poked his head through the silk khaleesi he said the andal is come and begs leave to enter the andal was what the dothraki called ser jorah yes she said rising clumsily send him in she trusted the knight he would know what to do if anyone did ser jorah mormont ducked through the door flap and waited a moment for his eyes to adjust to the dimness in the fierce heat of the south he wore loose trousers of mottled sandsilk and opentoed riding sandals that laced up to his knee his scabbard hung from a twisted horsehair belt under a bleached white vest he was barechested skin reddened by the sun talk goes from mouth to ear all over the khalasar he said it is said khal drogo fell from his horse help him dany pleaded for the love you say you bear me help him now the knight knelt beside her he looked at drogo long and hard and then at dany send your maids away wordlessly her throat tight with fear dany made a gesture irri herded the other girls from the tent when they were alone ser jorah drew his dagger deftly with a delicacy surprising in such a big man he began to scrape away the black leaves and dried blue mud from drogos chest the plaster had caked hard as the mud walls of the lamb men and like those walls it cracked easily ser jorah broke the dry mud with his knife pried the chunks from the flesh peeled off the leaves one by one a foul sweet smell rose from the wound so thick it almost choked her the leaves were crusted with blood and pus drogos breast black and glistening with corruption no dany whispered as tears ran down her cheeks no please gods hear me no khal drogo thrashed fighting some unseen enemy black blood ran slow and thick from his open wound your khal is good as dead princess no he cant die he mustnt it was only a cut dany took his large callused hand in her own small ones and held it tight between them i will not let him die ser jorah gave a bitter laugh khaleesi or queen that command is beyond your power save your tears child weep for him tomorrow or a year from now we do not have time for grief we must go and quickly before he dies dany was lost go where should we go page asshai i would say it lies far to the south at the end of the known world yet men say it is a great port we will find a ship to take us back to pentos it will be a hard journey make no mistake do you trust your khas will they come with us khal drogo commanded them to keep me safe dany replied uncertainly but if he dies she touched the swell of her belly i dont understand why should we flee i am khaleesi i carry drogos heir he will be khal after drogo ser jorah frowned princess hear me the dothraki will not follow a suckling babe drogos strength was what they bowed to and only that when he is gone jhaqo and pono and the other kos will fight for his place and this khalasar will devour itself the winner will want no more rivals the boy will be taken from your breast the moment he is born they will give him to the dogs dany hugged herself but why she cried plaintively why should they kill a little baby he is drogos son and the crones say he will be the stallion who mounts the world it was prophesied better to kill the child than to risk his fury when he grows to manhood the child kicked inside her as if he had heard dany remembered the story viserys had told her of what the usurpers dogs had done to rhaegars children his son had been a babe as well yet they had ripped him from his mothers breast and dashed his head against a wall that was the way of men they must not hurt my son she cried i will order my khas to keep him safe and drogos bloodriders will ser jorah held her by the shoulders a bloodrider dies with his khal you know that child they will take you to vaes dothrak to the crones that is the last duty they owe him in life when it is done they will join drogo in the night lands dany did not want to go back to vaes dothrak and live the rest of her life among those terrible old women yet she knew that the knight spoke the truth drogo had been more than her sunandstars he had been the shield that kept her safe i will not leave him she said stubbornly miserably she took his hand again i will not a stirring at the tent flap made dany turn her head mirti maz duur entered bowing low days on the march trailing behind the khalasar had left her limping and haggard with blistered and bleeding feet and hollows under her eyes behind her came ootho and haggo carrying the godswifes chest between them when the bloodriders caught sight of drogos wound the chest slipped from haggos fingers and crashed to the floor of the tent and qotho swore an oath so foul it seared the air mirri maz duur studied drogo her face still and dead the wound has festered this is your work maegi ootho said haggo laid his fist across mirris cheek with a meaty smack that drove her to the ground then he kicked her where she lay stop it dany screamed qotho pulled haggo away saying kicks are too merciful for a maegi take her outside we will stake her to the earth to be the mount of every passing man and when they are done with her the dogs will page use her as well weasels will tear out her entrails and carrion crows feast upon her eyes the flies off the river shall lay their eggs in her womb and drink pus from the ruins of her breasts he dug ironhard fingers into the soft wobbly flesh under the godswifes arm and hauled her to her feet no dany said i will not have her harmed qothos lips skinned back from his crooked brown teeth in a terrible mockery of a smile no you say me no better you should pray that we do not stake you out beside your maegi you did this as much as the other ser jorah stepped between them loosening his longsword in its scabbard rein in your tongue bloodrider the princess is still your khaleesi only while the bloodofmyblood still lives qotho told the knight when he dies she is nothing dany felt a tightness inside her before i was khaleesi i was the blood of the dragon ser jorah summon my khas no said qotho we will go for now khaleesi haggo followed him from the tent scowling that one means you no good princess mormont said the dothraki say a man and his bloodriders share one life and qotho sees it ending a dead man is beyond fear no one has died dany said ser jorah i may have need of your blade best go don your armor she was more frightened than she dared admit even to herself the knight bowed as you say he strode from the tent dany turned back to mirri maz duur the womans eyes were wary so you have saved me once more and now you must save him dany said please you do not ask a slave mirri replied sharply you tell her she went to drogo burning on his mat and gazed long at his wound ask or tell it makes no matter he is beyond a healers skills the khals eyes were closed she opened one with her fingers he has been dulling the hurt with milk of the poppy yes dany admitted i made him a poultice of firepod and stingmenot and bound it in a lambskin it burned he said he tore it off the herbwomen made him a new one wet and soothing it burned yes there is great healing magic in fire even your hairless men know that make him another poultice dany begged this time i will make certain he wears it the time for that is past my lady mirri said all i can do now is ease the dark road before him so he page might ride painless to the night lands he will be gone by morning her words were a knife through danys breast what had she ever done to make the gods so cruel she had finally found a safe place had finally tasted love and hope she was finally going home and now to lose it all no she pleaded save him and i will free you i swear it you must know a way some magic some mirri maz duur sat back on her heels and studied daenerys through eyes as black as night there is a spell her voice was quiet scarcely more than a whisper but it is hard lady and dark some would say that death is cleaner i learned the way in asshai and paid dear for the lesson my teacher was a bloodmage from the shadow lands dany went cold all over then you truly are a maegi am it mirri maz duur smiled only a maegi can save your rider now silver lady is there no other way no other khal drogo gave a shuddering gasp do it dany blurted she must not be afraid she was the blood of the dragon save him there is a price the godswife warned her youll have gold horses whatever you like it is not a matter of gold or horses this is bloodmagic lady only death may pay for life death dany wrapped her arms around herself protectively rocked back and forth on her heels my death she told herself she would die for him if she must she was the blood of the dragon she would not be afraid her brother rhaegar had died for the woman he loved no mirri maz duur promised not your death khaleesi dany trembled with relief do it the maegi nodded solemnly as you speak so it shall be done call your servants khal drogo writhed feebly as rakharo and quaro lowered him into the bath no he muttered no must ride once in the water all the strength seemed to leak out of him bring his horse mirri maz duur commanded and so it was done jhogo led the great red stallion into the tent when the animal caught the scent of death he screamed and reared rolling his eyes it took three men to subdue him what do you mean to do dany asked her page we need the blood mirri answered that is the way jhogo edged back his hand on his arakh he was a youth of sixteen years whipthin fearless quick to laugh with the faint shadow of his first mustachio on his upper lip he fell to his knees before her khaleesi he pleaded you must not do this thing let me kill this maegi kill her and you kill your khal dany said this is bloodmagic he said it is forbidden i am khaleesi and i say it is not forbidden in vaes dothrak khal drogo slew a stallion and i ate his heart to give our son strength and courage this is the same the same the stallion kicked and reared as rakharo quaro and aggo pulled him close to the tub where the khal floated like one already dead pus and blood seeping from his wound to stain the bathwaters mirri maz duur chanted words in a tongue that dany did not know and a knife appeared in her hand dany never saw where it came from it looked old hammered red bronze leafshaped its blade covered with ancient glyphs the maegi drew it across the stallions throat under the noble head and the horse screamed and shuddered as the blood poured out of him in a red rush he would have collapsed but the men of her khas held him up strength of the mount go into the rider mirri sang as horse blood swirled into the waters of drogos bath strength of the beast go into the man jhogo looked terrified as he struggled with the stallions weight afraid to touch the dead flesh yet afraid to let go as well only a horse dany thought if she could buy drogos life with the death of a horse she would pay a thousand times over when they let the stallion fall the bath was a dark red and nothing showed of drogo but his face mirri maz duur had no use for the carcass burn it dany told them it was what they did she knew when a man died his mount was killed and placed beneath him on the funeral pyre to carry him to the night lands the men of her khas dragged the carcass from the tent the blood had gone everywhere even the sandsilk walls were spotted with red and the rugs underfoot were black and wet braziers were lit mirri maz duur tossed a red powder onto the coals it gave the smoke a spicy scent a pleasant enough smell yet eroeh fled sobbing and dany was filled with fear but she had gone too far to turn back now she sent her handmaids away go with them silver lady mirri maz duur told her i will stay dany said the man took me under the stars and gave life to the child inside me i will not leave him you must once i begin to sing no one must enter this tent my song will wake powers old and dark the dead will dance here this night no living man must look on them dany bowed her head helpless no one will enter she bent over the tub over drogo in his bath of blood and kissed him lightly on the brow bring him back to me she whispered to mirri maz duur before she fled outside the sun was low on the horizon the sky a bruised red the page khalasar had made camp tents and sleeping mats were scattered as far as the eye could see a hot wind blew jhogo and aggo were digging a firepit to burn the dead stallion a crowd had gathered to stare at dany with hard black eyes their faces like masks of beaten copper she saw ser jorah mormont wearing mail and leather now sweat beading on his broad balding forehead he pushed his way through the dothraki to danys side when he saw the scarlet footprints her boots had left on the ground the color seemed to drain from his face what have you done you little fool he asked hoarsely i had to save him we could have fled he said i would have seen you safe to asshai princess there was no need am i truly your princess she asked him you know you are gods save us both then help me now ser jorah grimaced would that i knew how mirri maz duurs voice rose to a high ululating wail that sent a shiver down danys back some of the dothraki began to mutter and back away the tent was aglow with the light of braziers within through the bloodspattered sandsilk she glimpsed shadows moving mirri maz duur was dancing and not alone dany saw naked fear on the faces of the dothraki this must not be ootho thundered she had not seen the bloodrider return haggo and cohollo were with him they had brought the hairless men the eunuchs who healed with knife and needle and fire this will be dany replied maegi haggo growled and old cohollocohollo who had bound his life to drogos on the day of his birth cohollo who had always been kind to hercohollo spat full in her face you will die maegi qotho promised but the other must die first he drew his arakh and made for the tent no she shouted you mustnt she caught him by the shoulder but qotho shoved her aside dany fell to her knees crossing her arms over her belly to protect the child within stop him she commanded her khas kill him rakharo and quaro stood beside the tent flap quaro took a step forward reaching for the handle of his whip but qotho spun graceful as a dancer the curved arakh rising it caught quaro low under the arm the bright sharp steel biting up through leather and skin through muscle and rib bone blood fountained as the young rider reeled backward gasping page qotho wrenched the blade free horselord ser jorah mormont called try me his longsword slid from its scabbard qotho whirled cursing the arakh moved so fast that quaros blood flew from it in a fine spray like rain in a hot wind the longsword caught it a foot from ser jorahs face and held it quivering for an instant as qotho howled in fury the knight was clad in chainmail with gauntlets and greaves of lobstered steel and a heavy gorget around his throat but he had not thought to don his helm qotho danced backward arakh whirling around his head in a shining blur flickering out like lightning as the knight came on in a rush ser jorah parried as best he could but the slashes came so fast that it seemed to dany that qotho had four arakhs and as many arms she heard the crunch of sword on mail saw sparks fly as the long curved blade glanced off a gauntlet suddenly it was mormont stumbling backward and qotho leaping to the attack the left side of the knights face ran red with blood and a cut to the hip opened a gash in his mail and left him limping qotho screamed taunts at him calling him a craven a milk man a eunuch in an iron suit you die now he promised arakh shivering through the red twilight inside danys womb her son kicked wildly the curved blade slipped past the straight one and bit deep into the knights hip where the mail gaped open mormont grunted stumbled dany felt a sharp pain in her belly a wetness on her thighs qotho shrieked triumph but his arakh had found bone and for half a heartbeat it caught it was enough ser jorah brought his longsword down with all the strength left him through flesh and muscle and bone and qothos forearm dangled loose flopping on a thin cord of skin and sinew the knights next cut was at the dothrakis ear so savage that qothos face seemed almost to explode the dothraki were shouting mirri maz duur wailing inside the tent like nothing human quaro pleading for water as he died dany cried out for help but no one heard rakharo was fighting haggo arakh dancing with arakh until jhogos whip cracked loud as thunder the lash coiling around haggos throat a yank and the bloodrider stumbled backward losing his feet and his sword rakharo sprang forward howling swinging his arakh down with both hands through the top of haggos head the point caught between his eyes red and quivering someone threw a stone and when dany looked her shoulder was torn and bloody no she wept no please stop it its too high the price is too high more stones came flying she tried to crawl toward the tent but cohollo caught her fingers in her hair he pulled her head back and she felt the cold touch of his knife at her throat my baby she screamed and perhaps the gods heard for as quick as that cohollo was dead aggos arrow took him under the arm to pierce his lungs and heart when at last daenerys found the strength to raise her head she saw the crowd dispersing the dothraki stealing silently back to their tents and sleeping mats some were saddling horses and riding off the sun had set fires burned throughout the khalasar great orange blazes that crackled with fury and spit embers at the sky she tried to rise and agony seized her and squeezed her like a giants fist the breath went out of her it was all she could do to gasp the sound of mirri maz duurs voice was like a funeral dirge inside the tent the shadows whirled an arm went under her waist and then ser jorah was lifting her off her feet his face was sticky with blood and dany saw that half his ear was gone she convulsed in his arms as the pain took her again and heard the knight shouting for her handmaids to help him are they all so afraid she knew the page answer another pain grasped her and dany bit back a scream it felt as if her son had a knife in each hand as if he were hacking at her to cut his way out doreah curse you ser jorah roared come here fetch the birthing women they will not come they say she is accursed theyll come or ill have their heads doreah wept they are gone my lord the maegi someone else said was that aggo take her to the maegi no dany wanted to say no not that you mustnt but when she opened her mouth a long wail of pain escaped and the sweat broke over her skin what was wrong with them couldnt they see inside the tent the shapes were dancing circling the brazier and the bloody bath dark against the sandsilk and some did not look human she glimpsed the shadow of a great wolf and another like a man wreathed in flames the lamb woman knows the secrets of the birthing bed irri said she said so i heard her yes doreah agreed i heard her too no she shouted or perhaps she only thought it for no whisper of sound escaped her lips she was being carried her eyes opened to gaze up at a flat dead sky black and bleak and starless please no the sound of mirri maz duurs voice grew louder until it filled the world the shapes she screamed the dancers ser jorah carried her inside the tent arya the scent of hot bread drifting from the shops along the street of flour was sweeter than any perfume arya had ever smelled she took a deep breath and stepped closer to the pigeon it was a plump one speckled brown busily pecking at a crust that had fallen between two cobblestones but when aryas shadow touched it it took to the air her stick sword whistled out and caught it two feet off the ground and it went down in a flurry of brown feathers she was on it in the blink of an eye grabbing a wing as the pigeon flapped and fluttered it pecked at her hand she grabbed its neck and twisted until she felt the bone snap compared with catching cats pigeons were easy a passing septon was looking at her askance heres the best place to find pigeon arya told him as she brushed herself off and picked up her fallen stick sword they come for the crumbs he hurried away she tied the pigeon to her belt and started down the street a man was pushing a load of tarts by on a twowheeled cart the smells sang of blueberries and lemons and apricots her stomach made a hollow rumbly noise could i have one she heard herself say a lemon or page or any kind the pushcart man looked her up and down plainly he did not like what he saw three coppers arya tapped her wooden sword against the side of her boot ill trade you a fat pigeon she said the others take your pigeon the pushcart man said the tarts were still warm from the oven the smells were making her mouth water but she did not have three coppers or one she gave the pushcart man a look remembering what syrio had told her about seeing he was short with a little round belly and when he moved he seemed to favor his left leg a little she was just thinking that if she snatched a tart and ran he would never be able to catch her when he said you be keepin your filthy hands off the gold cloaks know how to deal with thieving little gutter rats that they do arya glanced warily behind her two of the city watch were standing at the mouth of an alley their cloaks hung almost to the ground the heavy wool dyed a rich gold their mail and boots and gloves were black one wore a longsword at his hip the other an iron cudgel with a last wistful glance at the tarts arya edged back from the cart and hurried off the gold cloaks had not been paying her any special attention but the sight of them tied her stomach in knots arya had been staying as far from the castle as she could get yet even from a distance she could see the heads rotting atop the high red walls flocks of crows squabbled noisily over each head thick as flies the talk in flea bottom was that the gold cloaks had thrown in with the lannisters their commander raised to a lord with lands on the trident and a seat on the kings council she had also heard other things scary things things that made no sense to her some said her father had murdered king robert and been slain in turn by lord renly others insisted that renly had killed the king in a drunken quarrel between brothers why else should he have fled in the night like a common thief one story said the king had been killed by a boar while hunting another that hed died eating a boar stuffing himself so full that hed ruptured at the table no the king had died at table others said but only because varys the spider poisoned him no it had been the queen who poisoned him no he had died of a pox no he had choked on a fish bone one thing all the stories agreed on king robert was dead the bells in the seven towers of the great sept of baelor had tolled for a day and a night the thunder of their grief rolling across the city in a bronze tide they only rang the bells like that for the death of a king a tanners boy told arya all she wanted was to go home but leaving kings landing was not so easy as she had hoped talk of war was on every lip and gold cloaks were as thick on the city walls as fleas on well her for one she had been sleeping in flea bottom on rooftops and in stables wherever she could find a place to lie down and it hadnt taken her long to learn that the district was well named every day since her escape from the red keep arya had visited each of the seven city gates in turn the dragon gate the lion gate and the old gate were closed and barred the mud gate and the page gate of the gods were open but only to those who wanted to enter the city the guards let no one out those who were allowed to leave left by the kings gate or the iron gate but lannister menatarms in crimson cloaks and lioncrested helms manned the guard posts there spying down from the roof of an inn by the kings gate arya saw them searching wagons and carriages forcing riders to open their saddlebags and questioning everyone who tried to pass on foot sometimes she thought about swimming the river but the blackwater rush was wide and deep and everyone agreed that its currents were wicked and treacherous she had no coin to pay a ferryman or take passage on a ship her lord father had taught her never to steal but it was growing harder to remember why if she did not get out soon she would have to take her chances with the gold cloaks she hadnt gone hungry much since she learned to knock down birds with her stick sword but she feared so much pigeon was making her sick a couple shed eaten raw before she found flea bottom in the bottom there were potshops along the alleys where huge tubs of stew had been simmering for years and you could trade half your bird for a heel of yesterdays bread and a bowl o brown and theyd even stick the other half in the fire and crisp it up for you so long as you plucked the feathers yourself arya would have given anything for a cup of milk and a lemon cake but the brown wasnt so bad it usually had barley in it and chunks of carrot and onion and turnip and sometimes even apple with a film of grease swimming on top mostly she tried not to think about the meat once she had gotten a piece of fish the only thing was the potshops were never empty and even as she bolted down her food arya could feel them watching some of them stared at her boots or her cloak and she knew what they were thinking with others she could almost feel their eyes crawling under her leathers she didnt know what they were thinking and that scared her even more a couple times she was followed out into the alleys and chased but so far no one had been able to catch her the silver bracelet shed hoped to sell had been stolen her first night out of the castle along with her bundle of good clothes snatched while she slept in a burntout house off pig alley all they left her was the cloak she had been huddled in the leathers on her back her wooden practice sword and needle shed been lying on top of needle or else it would have been gone too it was worth more than all the rest together since then arya had taken to walking around with her cloak draped over her right arm to conceal the blade at her hip the wooden sword she carried in her left hand out where everybody could see it to scare off robbers but there were men in the potshops who wouldnt have been scared off if shed had a battleaxe it was enough to make her lose her taste for pigeon and stale bread often as not she went to bed hungry rather than risk the stares once she was outside the city she would find berries to pick or orchards she might raid for apples and cherries arya remembered seeing some from the kingsroad on the journey south and she could dig for roots in the forest even run down some rabbits in the city the only things to run down were rats and cats and scrawny dogs the potshops would give you a fistful of coppers for a litter of pups shed heard but she didnt like to think about that down below the street of flour was a maze of twisting alleys and cross streets arya scrambled through the crowds trying to put distance between her and the gold cloaks she had learned to keep to the page center of the street sometimes she had to dodge wagons and horses but at least you could see them coming if you walked near the buildings people grabbed you in some alleys you couldnt help but brush against the walls the buildings leaned in so close they almost met a whooping gang of small children went running past chasing a rolling hoop arya stared at them with resentment remembering the times shed played at hoops with bran and jon and their baby brother rickon she wondered how big rickon had grown and whether bran was sad she would have given anything if jon had been here to call her little sister and muss her hair not that it needed mussing shed seen her reflection in puddles and she didnt think hair got any more mussed than hers she had tried talking to the children she saw in the street hoping to make a friend who would give her a place to sleep but she must have talked wrong or something the little ones only looked at her with quick wary eyes and ran away if she came too close their big brothers and sisters asked questions arya couldnt answer called her names and tried to steal from her only yesterday a scrawny barefoot girl twice her age had knocked her down and tried to pull the boots off her feet but arya gave her a crack on her ear with her stick sword that sent her off sobbing and bleeding a gull wheeled overhead as she made her way down the hill toward flea bottom arya glanced at it thoughtfully but it was well beyond the reach of her stick it made her think of the sea maybe that was the way out old nan used to tell stories of boys who stowed away on trading galleys and sailed off into all kinds of adventures maybe arya could do that too she decided to visit the riverfront it was on the way to the mud gate anyway and she hadnt checked that one today the wharfs were oddly quiet when arya got there she spied another pair of gold cloaks walking side by side through the fish market but they never so much as looked at her half the stalls were empty and it seemed to her that there were fewer ships at dock than she remembered out on the blackwater three of the kings war galleys moved in formation goldpainted hulls splitting the water as their oars rose and fell arya watched them for a bit then began to make her way along the river when she saw the guardsmen on the third pier in grey woolen cloaks trimmed with white satin her heart almost stopped in her chest the sight of winterfells colors brought tears to her eyes behind them a sleek threebanked trading galley rocked at her moorings arya could not read the name painted on the hull the words were strange myrish braavosi perhaps even high valyrian she grabbed a passing longshoreman by the sleeve please she said what ship is this shes the wind witch out of myr the man said shes still here arya blurted the longshoreman gave her a queer look shrugged and walked away arya ran toward the pier the wind witch was the ship father had hired to take her home still waiting shed imagined it had sailed ages ago two of the guardsmen were dicing together while the third walked rounds his hand on the pommel of his sword ashamed to let them see her crying like a baby she stopped to rub at her eyes her eyes her eyes her eyes why did look with your eyes she heard syrio whisper arya looked she knew all of her fathers men the three in the grey cloaks were strangers you the one walking rounds called out what do you want here boy the other two looked up from their dice page it was all arya could do not to bolt and run but she knew that if she did they would be after her at once she made herself walk closer they were looking for a girl but he thought she was a boy shed be a boy then want to buy a pigeon she showed him the dead bird get out of here the guardsman said arya did as he told her she did not have to pretend to be frightened behind her the men went back to their dice she could not have said how she got back to flea bottom but she was breathing hard by the time she reached the narrow crooked unpaved streets between the hills the bottom had a stench to it a stink of pigsties and stables and tanners sheds mixed in with the sour smell of winesinks and cheap whorehouses arya wound her way through the maze dully it was not until she caught a wwiff of bubbling brown coming through a potshop door that she realized her pigeon was gone it must have slipped from her belt as she ran or someone had stolen it and shed never noticed for a moment she wanted to cry again shed have to walk all the way back to the street of flour to find another one that plump far across the city bells began to ring arya glanced up listening wondering what the ringing meant this time whats this now a fat man called from the potshop the bells again gods hamercy wailed an old woman a redhaired whore in a wisp of painted silk pushed open a secondstory window is it the boy king thats died now she shouted down leaning out over the street ah thats a boy for you they never last long as she laughed a naked man slid his arms around her from behind biting her neck and rubbing the heavy white breasts that hung loose beneath her shift stupid slut the fat man shouted up the kings not dead thats only summoning bells one tower tolling when the king dies they ring every bell in the city here quit your biting or ill ring your bells the woman in the window said to the man behind her pushing him off with an elbow so who is it died if not the king its a summoning the fat man repeated two boys close to aryas age scampered past splashing through a puddle the old woman cursed them but they kept right on going other people were moving too heading up the hill to see what the noise was about arya ran after the slower boy where you going she shouted when she was right behind him whats happening he glanced back without slowing the gold cloaks is carryin him to the sept who she yelled running hard page the hand theyll be taking his head off buu says a passing wagon had left a deep rut in the street the boy leapt over but arya never saw it she tripped and fell face first scraping her knee open on a stone and smashing her fingers when her hands hit the hardpacked earth needle tangled between her legs she sobbed as she struggled to her knees the thumb of her left hand was covered with blood when she sucked on it she saw that half the thumbnail was gone ripped off in her fall her hands throbbed and her knee was all bloody too make way someone shouted from the cross street make wayfor my lords of redyne it was all arya could do to get out of the road before they ran her down four guardsmen on huge horses pounding past at a gallop they wore checked cloaks blueandburgundy behind them two young lordlings rode side by side on a pair of chestnut mares alike as peas in a pod arya had seen them in the bailey a hundred times the redwyne twins ser horas and ser hobber homely youths with orange hair and square freckled faces sansa and jeyne poole used to call them ser horror and ser slobber and giggle whenever they caught sight of them they did not look funny now everyone was moving in the same direction all in a hurry to see what the ringing was all about the bells seemed louder now clanging calling arya joined the stream of people her thumb hurt so bad where the nail had broken that it was all she could do not to cry she bit her lip as she limped along listening to the excited voices around her the kings hand lord stark theyre carrying him up to baelors sept i heard he was dead soon enough soon enough here i got me a silver stag says they lop his head off past time the traitor the man spat arya struggled to find a voice he never she started but she was only a child and they talked right over her fool they aint neither going to lop him since when do they knick traitors on the steps of the great sept well they dont mean to anoint him no knight i heard it was stark killed old king robert slit his throat in the woods and when they found him he stood there cool as you please and said it was some old boar did for his grace ah thats not true it was his own brother did him that renly him with his gold antlers you shut your lying mouth woman you dont know what youre saying his lordships a fine true man by the time they reached the street of the sisters they were packed in shoulder to shoulder arya let the human current carry her along page up to the top of visenyas hill the white marble plaza was a solid mass of people all yammering excitedly at each other and straining to get closer to the great sept of baelor the bells were very loud here arya squirmed through the press ducking between the legs of horses and clutching tight to her sword stick from the middle of the crowd all she could see were arms and legs and stomachs and the seven slender towers of the sept looming overhead she spotted a wood wagon and thought to climb up on the back where she might be able to see but others had the same idea the teamster cursed at them and drove them off with a crack of his whip arya grew frantic forcing her way to the front of the crowd she was shoved up against the stone of a plinth she looked up at baelor the blessed the septon king sliding her stick sword through her belt arya began to climb her broken thumbnail left smears of blood on the painted marble but she made it up and wedged herself in between the kings feet that was when she saw her father lord eddard stood on the high septons pulpit outside the doors of the sept supported between two of the gold cloaks he was dressed in a rich grey velvet doublet with a white wolf sewn on the front in beads and a grey wool cloak trimmed with fur but he was thinner than arya had ever seen him his long face drawn with pain he was not standing so much as being held up the cast over his broken leg was grey and rotten the high septon himself stood behind him a squat man grey with age and ponderously fat wearing long white robes and an immense crown of spun gold and crystal that wreathed his head with rainbows whenever he moved clustered around the doors of the sept in front of the raised marble pulpit were a knot of knights and high lords joffrey was prominent among them his raiment all crimson silk and satin patterned with prancing stags and roaring lions a gold crown on his head his queen mother stood beside him in a black mourning gown slashed with crimson a veil of black diamonds in her hair arya recognized the hound wearing a snowy white cloak over his dark grey armor with four of the kingsguard around him she saw varys the eunuch gliding among the lords in soft slippers and a patterned damask robe and she thought the short man with the silvery cape and pointed beard might be the one who had once fought a duel for mother and there in their midst was sansa dressed in skyblue silk with her long auburn hair washed and curled and silver bracelets on her wrists arya scowled wondering what her sister was doing here why she looked so happy a long line of goldcloaked spearmen held back the crowd commanded by a stout man in elaborate armor all black lacquer and gold filigree his cloak had the metallic shimmer of true clothofgold when the bell ceased to toll a quiet slowly settled across the great plaza and her father lifted his head and began to speak his voice so thin and weak she could scarcely make him out people behind her began to shout out what and louder the man in the blackandgold armor stepped up behind father and prodded him sharply you leave him alone arya wanted to shout but she knew no one page would listen she chewed her lip her father raised his voice and began again i am eddard stark lord of winterfell and hand of the king he said more loudly his voice carrying across the plaza and i come before you to confess my treason in the sight of gods and men no arya whimpered below her the crowd began to scream and shout taunts and obscenities filled the air sansa had hidden her face in her hands her father raised his voice still higher straining to be heard i betrayed the faith of my king and the trust of my friend robert he shouted i swore to defend and protect his children yet before his blood was cold i plotted to depose and murder his son and seize the throne for myself let the high septon and baelor the beloved and the seven bear witness to the truth of what i say joffrey baratheon is the one true heir to the iron throne and by the grace of all the gods lord of the seven kingdoms and protector of the realm a stone came sailing out of the crowd arya cried out as she saw her father hit the gold cloaks kept him from falling blood ran down his face from a deep gash across his forehead more stones followed one struck the guard to fathers left another went clanging off the breastplate of the knight in the blackandgold armor two of the kingsguard stepped in front of joffrey and the queen protecting them with their shields her hand slid beneath her cloak and found needle in its sheath she tightened her fingers around the grip squeezing as hard as she had ever squeezed anything please gods keep him safe she prayed dont let them hurt my father the high septon knelt before joffrey and his mother as we sin so do we suffer he intoned in a deep swelling voice much louder than fathers this man has confessed his crimes in the sight of gods and men here in this holy place rainbows danced around his head as he lifted his hands in entreaty the gods are just yet blessed baelor taught us that they are also merciful what shall be done with this traitor your grace a thousand voices were screaming but arya never heard them prince joffrey no king joffrey stepped out from behind the shields of his kingsguard my mother bids me let lord eddard take the black and lady sansa has begged mercy for her father he looked straight at sansa then and smiled and for a moment arya thought that the gods had heard her prayer until joffrey turned back to the crowd and said but they have the soft hearts of women so long as i am your king treason shall never go unpunished ser ilyn bring me his head the crowd roared and arya felt the statue of baelor rock as they surged against it the high septon clutched at the kings cape and varys came rushing over waving his arms and even the queen was saying something to him but joffrey shook his head lords and knights moved aside as he stepped through tall and fleshless a skeleton in iron mail the kings justice dimly as if from far off arya heard her sister scream sansa had fallen to her knees sobbing hysterically ser ilyn payne climbed the steps of the pulpit arya wriggled between baelors feet and threw herself into the crowd drawing needle she landed on a man in a butchers apron knocking him to the ground immediately someone slammed into her back and page she almost went down herself bodies closed in around her stumbling and pushing trampling on the poor butcher arya slashed at them with needle high atop the pulpit ser ilyn payne gestured and the knight in blackandgold gave a command the gold cloaks flung lord eddard to the marble with his head and chest out over the edge here you an angry voice shouted at arya but she bowled past shoving people aside squirming between them slamming into anyone in her way a hand fumbled at her leg and she hacked at it kicked at shins a woman stumbled and arya ran up her back cutting to both sides but it was no good no good there were too many people no sooner did she make a hole than it closed again someone buffeted her aside she could still hear sansa screaming ser ilyn drew a twohanded greatsword from the scabbard on his back as he lifted the blade above his head sunlight seemed to ripple and dance down the dark metal glinting off an edge sharper than any razor ke she thought he has ke her tears streamed down her face blinding her and then a hand shot out of the press and closed round her arm like a wolf trap so hard that needle went flying from her hand arya was wrenched off her feet she would have fallen if he hadnt held her up as easy as if she were a doll a face pressed close to hers long black hair and tangled beard and rotten teeth dont look a thick voice snarled at her i i i arya sobbed the old man shook her so hard her teeth rattled shut your mouth and close your eyes boy dimly as if from far away she heard a a noise a soft sighing sound as if a million people had let out their breath at once the old mans fingers dug into her arm stiff as iron look at me yes thats the way of it at me sour wine perfumed his breath remember boy it was the smell that did it arya saw the matted greasy hair the patched dusty black cloak that covered his twisted shoulders the hard black eyes squinting at her and she remembered the black brother who had come to visit her father know me now do you theres a bright boy he spat theyre done here youll be coming with me and youll be keeping your mouth shut when she started to reply he shook her again even harder shut i said the plaza was beginning to empty the press dissolved around them as people drifted back to their lives but aryas life was gone numb she trailed along beside yoren yes his name is yoren she did not recall him finding needle until he handed the sword back to her hope you can use that boy im not she started he shoved her into a doorway thrust dirty fingers through her hair and gave it a twist yanking her head back not a smart boy that what you mean to say he had a knife in his other hand as the blade flashed toward her face arya threw herself backward kicking wildly wrenching her head page from side to side but he had her by the hair so strong she could feel her scalp tearing and on her lips the salt taste of tears bran the oldest were men grown seventeen and eighteen years from the day of their naming one was past twenty most were younger sixteen or less bran watched them from the balcony of maester luwins turret listening to them grunt and strain and curse as they swung their staves and wooden swords the yard was alive to the clack of wood on wood punctuated all too often by thwacks and yowls of pain when a blow struck leather or flesh ser rodrik strode among the boys face reddening beneath his white whiskers muttering at them one and all bran had never seen the old knight look so fierce no he kept saying no no no they dont fight very well bran said dubiously he scratched summer idly behind the ears as the direwolf tore at a haunch of meat bones crunched between his teeth for a certainty maester luwin agreed with a deep sigh the maester was peering through his big myrish lens tube measuring shadows and noting the position of the comet that hung low in the morning sky yet given time ser rodrik has the truth of it we need men to walk the walls your lord father took the cream of his guard to kings landing and your brother took the rest along with all the likely lads for leagues around many will not come back to us and we must needs find the men to take their places bran stared resentfully at the sweating boys below if i still had my legs i could beat them all he remembered the last time hed held a sword in his hand when the king had come to winterfell it was only a wooden sword yet hed knocked prince tommen down half a hundred times ser rodrik should teach me to use a poleaxe if i had a poleaxe with a big long haft hodor could be my legs we could be a knight together i think that unlikely maester luwin said bran when a man fights his arms and legs and thoughts must be as one page below in the yard ser rodrik was yelling you fight like a goose he pecks you and you peck him harder pany block the blow goose fighting will not suffice if those were real swords the first peck would take your arm off one of the other boys laughed and the old knight rounded on him you laugh you now that is gall you fight like a hedgehog there was a knight once who couldnt see bran said stubbornly as ser rodrik went on below old nan told me about him he had a long staff with blades at both ends and he could spin it in his hands and chop two men at once symeon stareyes luwin said as he marked numbers in a book when he lost his eyes he put star sapphires in the empty sockets or so the singers claim bran that is only a story like the tales of florian the fool a fable from the age of heroes the maester tsked you must put these dreams aside they will only break your heart the mention of dreams reminded him i dreamed about the crow again last night the one with three eyes he flew into my bedchamber and told me to come with him so i did we went down to the crypts father was there and we talked he was sad and why was that luwin peered through his tube it was something to do about jon i think the dream had been deeply disturbing more so than any of the other crow dreams hodor wont go down into the crypts the maester had only been half listening bran could tell he lifted his eye from the tube blinking hodor wont t go down into the crypts when i woke i told him to take me down to see if father was truly there at first he didnt know what i was saying but i got him to the steps by telling him to go here and go there only then he wouldnt go down he just stood on the top step and said hodor like he was scared of the dark but i had a torch it made me so mad i almost gave him a swat in the head like old nan is always doing he saw the way the maester was frowning and hurriedly added i didnt though page good hodor is a man not a mule to be beaten in the dream i flew down with the crow but i cant do that when im awake bran explained why would you want to go down to the crypts i told you to look for father the maester tugged at the chain around his neck as he often did when he was uncomfortable bran sweet child one day lord eddard will sit below in stone beside his father and his fathers father and all the starks back to the old kings in the north but that will not be for many years gods be good your father is a prisoner of the queen in kings landing you will not find him in the crypts he was there last night i talked to him stubborn boy the maester sighed setting his book aside would you like to go see i cant hodor wont go and the steps are too narrow and twisty for dancer i believe i can solve that difficulty in place of hodor the wildling woman osha was summoned she was tall and tough and uncomplaining willing to go wherever she was commanded i lived my life beyond the wall a hole in the ground wont fret me none mlords she said summer come bran called as she lifted him in wirystrong arms the direwolf left his bone and followed as osha carried bran across the yard and down the spiral steps to the cold vault under the earth maester luwin went ahead with a torch bran did not even mindtoo badlythat she carried him in page her arms and not on her back ser rodrik had ordered oshas chain struck off since she had served faithfully and well since she had been at winterfell she still wore the heavy iron shackles around her anklesa sign that she was not yet wholly trustedbut they did not hinder her sure strides down the steps bran could not recall the last time he had been in the crypts it had been before for certain when he was little he used to play down here with robb and jon and his sisters he wished they were here now the vault might not have seemed so dark and scary summer stalked out in the echoing gloom then stopped lifted his head and sniffed the chill dead air he bared his teeth and crept backward eyes glowing golden in the light of the maesters torch even osha hard as old iron seemed uncomfortable grim folk by the look of them she said as she eyed the long row of granite starks on their stone thrones they were the kings of winter bran whispered somehow it felt wrong to talk too loudly in this place osha smiled winters got no king if youd seen it youd know that summer boy they were the kings in the north for thousands of years maester luwin said lifting the torch high so the light shone on the stone faces some were hairy and bearded shaggy men fierce as the wolves that crouched by their feet others were shaved clean their features gaunt and sharpedged as the iron longswords across their laps hard men for a hard time come he strode briskly down the vault past the procession of stone pillars and the endless carved figures a tongue of flame trailed back from the upraised torch as he went the vault was cavernous longer than winterfell itself and jon had told him once that there were other levels underneath vaults even deeper and darker where the older kings were buried it would not do to lose the light summer refused to move from the steps even when osha followed the torch bran in her arms do you recall your history bran the maester said as they walked tell osha who they were and what they did if you can page he looked at the passing faces and the tales came back to him the maester had told him the stories and old nan had made them come alive that one is jon stark when the sea raiders landed in the east he drove them out and built the castle at white harbor his son was rickard stark not my fathers father but another rickard he took the neck away from the marsh king and married his daughter theon starks the real thin one with the long hair and the skinny beard they called him the hungry wolf because he was always at war thats a brandon the tall one with the dreamy face he was brandon the shipwright because he loved the sea his tomb is empty he tried to sail west across the sunset sea and was never seen again his son was brandon the burner because he put the torch to all his fathers ships in grief theres rodrik stark who won bear island in a wrestling match and gave it to the mormonts and thats torrhen stark the king who knelt he was the last king in the north and the first lord of winterfell after he yielded to aegon the conqueror oh there hes cregan stark he fought with prince aemon once and the dragonknight said hed never faced a finer swordsman they were almost at the end now and bran felt a sadness creeping over him and theres my grandfather lord rickard who was beheaded by mad king aerys his daughter lyanna and his son brandon are in the tombs beside him not me another brandon my fathers brother theyre not supposed to have statues thats only for the lords and the kings but my father loved them so much he had them done the maids a fair one osha said robert was betrothed to marry her but prince rhaegar carried her off and raped her bran explained robert fought a war to win her back he killed rhaegar on the trident with his hammer but lyanna died and he never got her back at all a sad tale said osha but those empty holes are sadder lord eddards tomb for when his time comes maester luwin said is this where you saw your father in your dream bran yes the memory made him shiver he looked around the vault uneasily the hairs on the back of his neck bristling had he heard a noise was there someone here page maester luwin stepped toward the open sepulchre torch in hand as you see hes not here nor will he be for many a year dreams are only dreams child he thrust his arm into the blackness inside the tomb as into the mouth of some great beast do you see its quite empt the darkness sprang at him snarling bran saw eyes like green fire a flash of teeth fur as black as the pit around them maester luwin yelled and threw up his hands the torch went flying from his fingers caromed off the stone face of brandon stark and tumbled to the statues feet the flames licking up his legs in the drunken shifting torchlight they saw luwin struggling with the direwolf beating at his muzzle with one hand while the jaws closed on the other summer bran screamed and summer came shooting from the dimness behind them a leaping shadow he slammed into shaggydog and knocked him back and the two direwolves rolled over and over in a tangle of grey and black fur snapping and biting at each other while maester luwin struggled to his knees his arm torn and bloody osha propped bran up against lord rickards stone wolf as she hurried to assist the maester in the light of the guttering torch shadow wolves twenty feet tall fought on the wall and roof shaggy a small voice called when bran looked up his little brother was standing in the mouth of fathers tomb with one final snap at summers face shaggydog broke off and bounded to rickons side you let my father be rickon warned luwin you let him be rickon bran said softly fathers not here yes he is i saw him tears glistened on rickons face i saw him last night in your dream page rickon nodded you leave him you leave him be hes coming home now like he promised hes coming home bran had never seen maester luwin took so uncertain before blood dripped down his arm where shaggydog had shredded the wool of his sleeve and the flesh beneath osha the torch he said biting through his pain and she snatched it up before it went out soot stains blackened both legs of his uncles likeness that that beast luwin went on is supposed to be chained up in the kennels rickon patted shaggydogs muzzle damp with blood i let him loose he doesnt like chains he licked at his fingers rickon bran said would you like to come with me no i like it here its dark here and cold im not afraid i have to wait for father you can wait with me bran said well wait together you and me and our wolves both of the direwolves were licking wounds now and would bear close watching bran the maester said firmly i know you mean well but shaggydog is too wild to run loose im the third man hes savaged give him the freedom of the castle and its only a question of time before he kills someone the truth is hard but the wolf has to be chained or he hesitated or killed bran thought but what he said was he was not made for chains we will wait in your tower all of us page that is quite impossible maester luwin said osha grinned the boys the lordling here as i recall she handed luwin back his torch and scooped bran up into her arms again the maesters tower it is will you come rickon his brother nodded if shaggy comes too he said running after osha and bran and there was nothing maester luwin could do but follow keeping a wary eye on the wolves maester luwins turret was so cluttered that it seemed to bran a wonder that he ever found anything tottering piles of books covered tables and chairs rows of stoppered jars lined the shelves candle stubs and puddles of dried wax dotted the furniture the bronze myrish lens tube sat on a tripod by the terrace door star charts hung from the walls shadow maps lay scattered among the rushes papers quills and pots of inks were everywhere and all of it was spotted with droppings from the ravens in the rafters their strident quorks drifted down from above as osha washed and cleaned and bandaged the maesters wounds under luwins terse instruction this is folly the small grey man said while she dabbed at the wolf bites with a stinging ointment i agree that it is odd that both you boys dreamed the same dream yet when you stop to consider it its only natural you miss your lord father and you know that he is a captive fear can fever a mans mind and give him queer thoughts rickon is too young to comprehend im four now rickon said he was peeking through the lens tube at the gargoyles on the first keep the direwolves sat on opposite sides of the large round room licking their wounds and gnawing on bones too young andooh seven hells that burns no dont stop more too young as i say but you bran youre old enough to know that dreams are only dreams some are some arent osha poured pale red firemilk into a long gash luwin gasped the children of the forest could tell you a thing or two about dreaming page tears were streaming down the maesters face yet he shook his head doggedly the children live only in dreams now dead and gone enough thats enough now the bandages pads and then wrap and make it tight ill be bleeding old nan says the children knew the songs of the trees that they could fly like birds and swim like fish and talk to the animals bran said she says that they made music so beautiful that it made you cry like a little baby just to hear it and all this they did with magic maester luwin said distracted i wish they were here now a spell would heal my arm less painfully and they could talk to shaggydog and tell him not to bite he gave the big black wolf an angry glance out of the corner of his eye take a lesson bran the man who trusts in spells is dueling with a glass sword as the children did here let me show you something he stood abruptly crossed the room and returned with a green jar in his good hand have a look at these he said as he pulled the stopper and shook out a handful of shiny black arrowheads bran picked one up its made of glass curious rickon drifted closer to peer over the table dragonglass osha named it as she sat down beside luwin bandagings in hand obsidian maester luwin insisted holding out his wounded arm forged in the fires of the gods far below the earth the children of the forest hunted with that thousands of years ago the children worked no metal in place of mail they wore long shirts of woven leaves and bound their legs in bark so they seemed to melt into the wood in place of swords they carried blades of obsidian and still do osha placed soft pads over the bites on the maesters forearm and bound them tight with long strips of linen page bran held the arrowhead up close the black glass was slick and shiny he thought it beautiful can i keep one as you wish the maester said i want one too rickon said i want four im four luwin made him count them out careful theyre still sharp dont cut yourself tell me about the children bran said it was important what do you wish to know everything maester luwin tugged at his chain collar where it chafed against his neck they were people of the dawn age the very first before kings and kingdoms he said in those days there were no castles or holdfasts no cities not so much as a market town to be found between here and the sea of dorne there were no men at all only the children of the forest dwelt in the lands we now call the seven kingdoms they were a people dark and beautiful small of stature no taller than children even when grown to manhood they lived in the depths of the wood in caves and crannogs and secret tree towns slight as they were the children were quick and graceful male and female hunted together with weirwood bows and flying snares their gods were the gods of the forest stream and stone the old gods whose names are secret their wise men were called greenseers and carved strange faces in the weirwoods to keep watch on the woods how long the children reigned here or where they came from no man can know but some twelve thousand years ago the first men appeared from the east crossing the broken arm of dorne before it was broken they came with bronze swords and great leathern shields riding horses no horse had ever been seen on this side of the narrow sea no doubt the children were as frightened by the horses as the first men were by the faces in the trees as the first men carved out holdfasts and farms they cut down the faces and gave them to the fire horrorstruck the children went to war the old page songs say that the greenseers used dark magics to make the seas rise and sweep away the land shattering the arm but it was too late to close the door the wars went on until the earth ran red with blood of men and children both but more children than men for men were bigger and stronger and wood and stone and obsidian make a poor match for bronze finally the wise of both races prevailed and the chiefs and heroes of the first men met the greenseers and wood dancers amidst the weirwood groves of a small island in the great lake called gods eye there they forged the pact the first men were given the coastlands the high plains and bright meadows the mountains and bogs but the deep woods were to remain forever the childrens and no more weirwoods were to be put to the axe anywhere in the realm so the gods might bear witness to the signing every tree on the island was given a face and afterward the sacred order of green men was formed to keep watch over the isle of faces the pact began four thousand years of friendship between men and children in time the first men even put aside the gods they had brought with them and took up the worship of the secret gods of the wood the signing of the pact ended the dawn age and began the age of heroes brans fist curled around the shiny black arrowhead but the children of the forest are all gone now you said here they are said osha as she bit off the end of the last bandage with her teeth north of the wall things are different thats where the children went and the giants and the other old races maester luwin sighed woman by rights you ought to be dead or in chains the starks have treated you more gently than you deserve it is unkind to repay them for their kindness by filling the boys heads with folly tell me where they went bran said i want to know page me too rickon echoed oh very well luwin muttered so long as the kingdoms of the first men held sway the pact endured all through the age of heroes and the long night and the birth of the seven kingdoms yet finally there came a time many centuries later when other peoples crossed the narrow sea the andals were the first a race of tall fairhaired warriors who came with steel and fire and the sevenpointed star of the new gods painted on their chests the wars lasted hundreds of years but in the end the six southron kingdoms all fell before them only here where the king in the north threw back every army that tried to cross the neck did the rule of the first men endure the andals burnt out the weirwood groves hacked down the faces slaughtered the children where they found them and everywhere proclaimed the triumph of the seven over the old gods so the children fled north summer began to howl maester luwin broke off startled when shaggydog bounded to his feet and added his voice to his brothers dread clutched at brans heart its coming he whispered with the certainty of despair he had known it since last night he realized since the crow had led him down into the crypts to say farewell he had known it but he had not believed he had wanted maester luwin to be right the crow he thought the threeeyed crow the howling stopped as suddenly as it had begun summer padded across the tower floor to shaggydog and began to lick at a mat of bloody fur on the back of his brothers neck from the window came a flutter of wings a raven landed on the grey stone sill opened its beak and gave a harsh raucous rattle of distress rickon began to cry his arrowheads fell from his hand one by one and clattered on the floor bran pulled him close and hugged him page maester luwin stared at the black bird as if it were a scorpion with feathers he rose slow as a sleepwalker and moved to the window when he whistled the raven hopped onto his bandaged forearm there was dried blood on its wings a hawk luwin murmured perhaps an owl poor thing a wonder it got through he took the letter from its leg bran found himself shivering as the maester unrolled the paper what is it he said holding his brother all the harder you know what it is boy osha said not unkindly she put her hand on his head maester luwin looked up at them numbly a small grey man with blood on the sleeve of his grey wool robe and tears in his bright grey eyes my lords he said to the sons in a voice gone hoarse and shrunken we we shall need to find a stonecarver who knew his likeness well sansa in the tower room at the heart of maegors holdfast sansa gave herself to the darkness she drew the curtains around her bed slept woke weeping and slept again when she could not sleep she lay under her blankets shivering with grief servants came and went bringing meals but the sight of food was more than she could bear the dishes piled up on the table beneath her window untouched and spoiling until the servants took them away again sometimes her sleep was leaden and dreamless and she woke from it more tired than when she had closed her eyes yet those were the best times for when she dreamed she dreamed of father waking or sleeping she saw him saw the gold cloaks fling him down saw ser ilyn striding forward unsheathing ice from the scabbard on his back saw the moment the moment when she had wanted to look away she had wanted to her legs had gone out from under her and she had fallen to her knees yet somehow she could not turn her head and all the people were screaming and shouting and her prince page had smiled at her hed smiled and shed felt safe but only for a heartbeat until he said those words and her fathers legs that was what she remembered his legs the way theyd jerked when ser ilyn when the sword perhaps i will die too she told herself and the thought did not seem so terrible to her if she flung herself from the window she could put an end to her suffering and in the years to come the singers would write songs of her grief her body would lie on the stones below broken and innocent shaming all those who had betrayed her sansa went so far as to cross the bedchamber and throw open the shutters but then her courage left her and she ran back to her bed sobbing the serving girls tried to talk to her when they brought her meals but she never answered them once grand maester pycelle came with a box of flasks and bottles to ask if she was ill he felt her brow made her undress and touched her all over while her bedmaid held her down when he left he gave her a potion of honeywater and herbs and told her to drink a swallow every night she drank it all right then and went back to sleep she dreamt of footsteps on the tower stair an ominous scraping of leather on stone as a man climbed slowly toward her bedchamber step by step all she could do was huddle behind her door and listen trembling as he came closer and closer it was ser ilyn payne she knew coming for her with ice in his hand coming to take her head there was no place to run no place to hide no way to bar the door finally the footsteps stopped and she knew he was just outside standing there silent with his dead eyes and his long pocked face that was when she realized she was naked she crouched down trying to cover herself with her hands as her door began to swing open creaking the point of the greatsword poking through she woke murmuring please please ill be good ill be good please dont but there was no one to hear when they finally came for her in truth sansa never heard their footsteps it was joffrey who opened her door not ser ilyn but the boy who had been her prince she was in bed curled up tight her curtains drawn and she could not have said if it was noon or midnight the first thing she heard was the slam of the door then her bed hangings were yanked back and she threw up a hand against the sudden light and saw them standing over her page you will attend me in court this afternoon joffrey said see that you bathe and dress as befits my betrothed sandor clegane stood at his shoulder in a plain brown doublet and green mantle his burned face hideous in the morning light behind them were two knights of the mngsguard in long white satin cloaks sansa drew her blanket up to her chin to cover herself no she whimpered please leave me be if you wont rise and dress yourself my hound will do it for you joffrey said i beg of you my prince im king now dog get her out of bed sandor clegane scooped her up around the waist and lifted her off the featherbed as she struggled feebly her blanket fell to the floor underneath she had only a thin bedgown to cover her nakedness do as youre bid child clegane said dress he pushed her toward her wardrobe almost gently sansa backed away from them i did as the queen asked i wrote the letters i wrote what she told me you promised youd be merciful please let me go home i wont do any treason ill be good i swear it i dont have traitors blood i dont i only want to go home remembering her courtesies she lowered her head as it please you she finished weakly it does not please me joffrey said mother says im still to marry you so youll stay here and youll obey i dont want to marry you sansa wailed you chopped off my fathers head page he was a traitor i never promised to spare him only that id be merciful and i was if he hadnt been your father i would have had him torn or flayed but i gave him a clean death sansa stared at him seeing him for the first time he was wearing a padded crimson doublet patterned with lions and a clothofgold cape with a high collar that framed his face she wondered how she could ever have thought him handsome his lips were as soft and red as the worms you found after a rain and his eyes were vain and cruel i hate you she whispered king joffreys face hardened my mother tells me that it isnt fitting that a king should strike his wife ser meryn the knight was on her before she could think yanking back her hand as she tried to shield her face and backhanding her across the ear with a gloved fist sansa did not remember failing yet the next she knew she was sprawled on one knee amongst the rushes her head was ringing ser meryn trant stood over her with blood on the knuckles of his white silk glove will you obey now or shall i have him chastise you again sansas ear felt numb she touched it and her fingertips came away wet and red i as as you command my lord your grace joffrey corrected her i shall look for you in court he turned and left ser meryn and ser arys followed him out but sandor clegane glorgl rr martin lingered long enough to yank her roughly to her feet save yourself some pain girl and give him what he wants page what what does he want please tell me he wants you to smile and smell sweet and be his lady love the hound rasped he wants to hear you recite all your pretty little words the way the septa taught you he wants you to love him and fear him after he was gone sansa sank back onto the rushes staring at the wall until two of her bedmaids crept timidly into the chamber i will need hot water for my bath please she told them and perfume and some powder to hide this bruise the right side of her face was swollen and beginning to ache but she knew joffrey would want her to be beautiful the hot water made her think of winterfell and she took strength from that she had not washed since the day her father died and she was startled at how filthy the water became her maids sluiced the blood off her face scrubbed the dirt from her back washed her hair and brushed it out until it sprang back in thick auburn curls sansa did not speak to them except to give them commands they were lannister servants not her own and she did not trust them when the time came to dress she chose the green silk gown that she had worn to the tourney she recalled how gallant joff had been to her that night at the feast perhaps it would make him remember as well and treat her more gently she drank a glass of buttermilk and nibbled at some sweet biscuits as she waited to settle her stomach it was midday when ser meryn returned he had donned his white armor a shirt of enameled scales chased with gold a tall helm with a golden sunburst crest greaves and gorget and gauntlet and boots of gleaming plate a heavy wool cloak clasped with a golden lion his visor had been removed from his helm to better show his dour face pouchy bags under his eyes a wide sour mouth rusty hair spotted with grey my lady he said bowing as if he had not beaten her bloody only three hours past his grace has instructed me to escort you to the throne room did he instruct you to hit me if i refused to come are you refusing to come my lady the look he gave her was without expression he did not so much as glance at the bruise he had left her he did not hate her sansa realized neither did he love her he felt nothing for her at all she was only a a thing to him no she said rising she wanted to rage to hurt him as hed hurt her to warn him that when she was queen she would have him exiled if he ever page dared strike her again but she remembered what the hound had told her so all she said was i shall do whatever his grace commands as i do he replied yes but you are no true knight ser meryn sandor clegane would have laughed at that sansa knew other men might have cursed her warned her to keep silent even begged for her forgiveness ser meryn trant did none of these ser meryn trant simply did not care the balcony was deserted save for sansa she stood with her head bowed fighting to hold back her tears while below joffrey sat on his iron throne and dispensed what it pleased him to call justice nine cases out of ten seemed to bore him those he allowed his council to handle squirming restlessly while lord baelish grand maester pycelle or queen cersei resolved the matter when he did choose to make a ruling though not even his queen mother could sway him a thief was brought before him and he had ser ilyn chop his hand off right there in court two knights came to him with a dispute about some land and he decreed that they should duel for it on the morrow to the death he added a woman fell to her knees to plead for the head of a man executed as a traitor she had loved him she said and she wanted to see him decently buried if you loved a traitor you must be a traitor too joffrey said two gold cloaks dragged her off to the dungeons frogfaced lord slynt sat at the end of the council table wearing a black velvet doublet and a shiny clothofgold cape nodding with approval every time the king pronounced a sentence sansa stared hard at his ugly face remembering how he had thrown down her father for ser ilyn to behead wishing she could hurt him wishing that some hero would throw him down and cut off his head but a voice inside her whispered there are no heroes and she remembered what lord petyr had said to her here in this very hall life is not a song sweetling hed told her you may learn that one day to your sorrow in life the monsters win she told herself and now it was the hounds voice she heard a cold rasp metal on stone save yourself some pain girl and give him what he wants page the last case was a plump tavern singer accused of making a song that ridiculed the late king robert joff commanded them to fetch his woodharp and ordered him to perform the song for the court the singer wept and swore he would never sing that song again but the king insisted it was sort of a funny song all about robert fighting with a pig the pig was the boar whod killed him sansa knew but in some verses it almost sounded as if he were singing about the queen when the song was done joffrey announced that hed decided to be merciful the singer could keep either his fingers or his tongue he would have a day to make his choice janos slynt nodded that was the final business of the afternoon sansa saw with relief but her ordeal was not yet done when the heralds voice dismissed the court she fled the balcony only to find joffrey waiting for her at the base of the curving stairs the hound was with him and ser meryn as well the young king examined her critically top to bottom you look much better than you did thank you your grace sansa said hollow words but they made him nod and smile walk with me jofftey commanded offering her his arm she had no choice but to take it the touch of his hand would have thrilled her once now it made her flesh crawl my name day will be here soon joffrey said as they slipped out the rear of the throne room there will be a great feast and gifts what are you going to give me i i had not thought my lord your grace he said sharply you truly are a stupid girl arent you my mother says so she does after all that had happened his words should have lost their power to hurt her yet somehow they had not the queen had always been so kind to her oh yes she worries about our children whether theyll be stupid like you but i told her not to trouble herself the king gestured and ser meryn opened a door for them page thank you your grace she murmured the hound was right she thought i am only a little bird repeating the words they taught me the sun had fallen below the western wall and the stones of the red keep glowed dark as blood ill get you with child as soon as youre able joffrey said as he escorted her across the practice yard if the first one is stupid ill chop off your head and find a smarter wife when do you think youll be able to have children sansa could not look at him he shamed her so septa mordane says most most highborn girls have their flowering at twelve or thirteen joffrey nodded this way he led her into the gatehouse to the base of the steps that led up to the battlements sansa jerked back away from him trembling suddenly she knew where they were going no she said her voice a frightened gasp please no dont make me i beg you joffrey pressed his lips together i want to show you what happens to traitors sansa shook her head wildly i wont i wont i can have ser meryn drag you up he said you wont like that you had better do what i say joffrey reached for her and sansa cringed away from him backing into the hound do it girl sandor clegane told her pushing her back toward the king his mouth twitched on the burned side of his face and sansa could almost hear the rest of it hell have you up there no matter what so give him what he wants page she forced herself to take king joffreys hand the climb was something out of a nightmare every step was a struggle as if she were pulling her feet out of ankledeep mud and there were more steps than she would have believed a thousand thousand steps and horror waiting on the ramparts from the high battlements of the gatehouse the whole world spread out below them sansa could see the great sept of baelor on visenyas hill where her father had died at the other end of the street of the sisters stood the fireblackened ruins of the dragonpit to the west the swollen red sun was halfhidden behind the gate of the gods the salt sea was at her back and to the south was the fish market and the docks and the swirling torrent of the blackwater rush and to the north she turned that way and saw only the city streets and alleys and hills and bottoms and more streets and more alleys and the stone of distant walls yet she knew that beyond them was open country farms and fields and forests and beyond that north and north and north again stood winterfell what are you looking at joffrey said this is what i wanted you to see right here a thick stone parapet protected the outer edge of the rampart reaching as high as sansas chin with crenellations cut into it every five feet for archers the heads were mounted between the crenels along the top of the wall impaled on iron spikes so they faced out over the city sansa had noted them the moment shed stepped out onto the wallwalk but the river and the bustling streets and the setting sun were ever so much prettier he can make me look at the heads she told herself but he cant make me see them this one is your father he said this one here dog turn it around so she can see him sandor clegane took the head by the hair and turned it the severed head had been dipped in tar to preserve it longer sansa looked at it calmly not seeing it at all it did not really look like lord eddard she thought it did not even look real how long do i have to look page joffrey seemed disappointed do you want to see the rest there was a long row of them if it please your grace joffrey marched her down the wallwalk past a dozen more heads and two empty spikes im saving those for my uncle stannis and my uncle renly he explained the other heads had been dead and mounted much longer than her father despite the tar most were long past being recognizable the king pointed to one and said thats your septa there but sansa could not even have told that it was a woman the jaw had rotted off her face and birds had eaten one ear and most of a cheek sansa had wondered what had happened to septa mordane although she supposed she had known all along why did you kill her she asked she was godsworn she was a traitor joffrey looked pouty somehow she was upsetting him you havent said what you mean to give me for my name day maybe i should give you something instead would you like that if it please you my lord sansa said when he smiled she knew he was mocking her your brother is a traitor too you know he turned septa mordanes head back around i remember your brother from winterfell my dog called him the lord of the wooden sword didnt you dog did it the hound replied i dont recall joffrey gave a petulant shrug your brother defeated my uncle jaime my mother says it was treachery and deceit she wept when she heard women are all weak even her though she pretends she isnt she says we need to stay in kings landing in case my other uncles attack but i dont care after my name day feast im going to raise a host and kill your brother myself thats what ill give you lady sansa your brothers head a kind of madness took over her then and she heard herself say maybe my brother will give me your page head joffrey scowled you must never mock me like that a true wife does not mock her lord ser meryn teach her this time the knight grasped her beneath the jaw and held her head still as he struck her he hit her twice left to right and harder right to left her lip split and blood ran down her chin to mingle with the salt of her tears you shouldnt be crying all the time joffrey told her youre more pretty when you smile and laugh sansa made herself smile afraid that he would have ser meryn hit her again if she did not but it was no good the king still shook his head wipe off the blood youre all messy the outer parapet came up to her chin but along the inner edge of the walk was nothing nothing but a long plunge to the bailey seventy or eighty feet below all it would take was a shove she told herself he was standing right there right there smirking at her with those fat wormlips you could do it she told herself you could do it right now it wouldnt even matter if she went over with him it wouldnt matter at all here girl sandor clegane knelt before her between her and joffrey with a delicacy surprising in such a big man he dabbed at the blood welling from her broken lip the moment was gone sansa lowered her eyes thank you she said when he was done she was a good girl and always remembered her courtesies daenerys page wings shadowed her fever dreams you dont want to wake the dragon do you she was walking down a long hall beneath high stone arches she could not look behind her must not look behind her there was a door ahead of her tiny with distance but even from afar she saw that it was painted red she walked faster and her bare feet left bloody footprints on the stone you dont want to wake the dragon do you she saw sunlight on the dothraki sea the living plain rich with the smells of earth and death wind stirred the grasses and they rippled like water drogo held her in strong arms and his hand stroked her sex and opened her and woke that sweet wetness that was his alone and the stars smiled down on them stars in a daylight sky home she whispered as he entered her and filled her with his seed but suddenly the stars were gone and across the blue sky swept the great wings and the world took flame dont want to wake the dragon do you ser jorahs face was drawn and sorrowful rhaegar was the last dragon he told her he warmed translucent hands over a glowing brazier where stone eggs smouldered red as coals one moment he was there and the next he was fading his flesh colorless less substantial than the wind the last dragon he whispered thin as a wisp and was gone she felt the dark behind her and the red door seemed farther away than ever dont want to wake the dragon do you viserys stood before her screaming the dragon does not beg slut you do not command the dragon i am the dragon and i will be crowned the molten gold trickled down his face like wax burning deep channels in his flesh i am the dragon and i will be crowned he shrieked and his fingers snapped like snakes biting at her nipples pinching twisting even as his eyes burst and ran like jelly down seared and blackened cheeks page dont want to wake the dragon the red door was so far ahead of her and she could feel the icy breath behind sweeping up on her if it caught her she would die a death that was more than death howling forever alone in the darkness she began to run dont want to wake the dragon she could feel the heat inside her a terrible burning in her womb her son was tall and proud with drogos copper skin and her own silvergold hair violet eyes shaped like almonds and he smiled for her and began to lift his hand toward hers but when he opened his mouth the fire poured out she saw his heart burning through his chest and in an instant he was gone consumed like a moth by a candle turned to ash she wept for her child the promise of a sweet mouth on her breast but her tears turned to steam as they touched her skin want to wake the dragon ghosts lined the hallway dressed in the faded raiment of kings in their hands were swords of pale fire they had hair of silver and hair of gold and hair of platinum white and their eyes were opal and amethyst tourmaline and jade faster they cried faster faster she raced her feet melting the stone wherever they touched faster the ghosts cried as one and she screamed and threw herself forward a great knife of pain ripped down her back and she felt her skin tear open and smelled the stench of burning blood and saw the shadow of wings and daenerys targaryen flew wake the dragon the door loomed before her the red door so close so close the hall was a blur around her the cold receding behind and now the stone was gone and she flew across the dothraki sea high and higher the green rippling beneath and all that lived and breathed fled in terror from the shadow of her wings she could smell home she could see it there just beyond that door green fields and great stone houses and arms to keep her warm there she threw open the door page the dragon and saw her brother rhaegar mounted on a stallion as black as his armor fire glimmered red through the narrow eye slit of his helm the last dragon ser jorahs voice whispered faintly the last the last dany lifted his polished black visor the face within was her own after that for a long time there was only the pain the fire within her and the whisperings of stars she woke to the taste of ashes no she moaned no please khaleesi jhiqui hovered over her a frightened doe the tent was drenched in shadow still and close flakes of ash drifted upward from a brazier and dany followed them with her eyes through the smoke hole above flying she thought i had wings i was flying but it was only a dream help me she whispered struggling to rise bring me her voice was raw as a wound and she could not think what she wanted why did she hurt so much it was as if her body had been torn to pieces and remade from the scraps i want yes khaleesi quick as that jhiqui was gone bolting from the tent shouting dany needed something someone what it was important she knew it was the only thing in the world that mattered she rolled onto her side and got an elbow under her fighting the blanket tangled about her legs it was so hard to move the world swam dizzily i have to they found her on the carpet crawling toward her dragon eggs ser jorah mormont lifted her in his arms and carried her back to her sleeping silks while she struggled feebly against him over his shoulder she saw her three handmaids jhogo with his little wisp of mustache and the flat broad face of mirri maz duur i must she tried to tell them i have to page sleep princess ser jorah said no dany said please please yes he covered her with silk though she was burning sleep and grow strong again khaleesi come back to us and then mirri maz duur was there the maegi tipping a cup against her lips she tasted sour milk and something else something thick and bitter warm liquid ran down her chin somehow she swallowed the tent grew dimmer and sleep took her again this time she did not dream she floated serene and at peace on a black sea that knew no shore after a timea night a day a year she could not sayshe woke again the tent was dark its silken walls flapping like wings when the wind gusted outside this time dany did not attempt to rise irri she called jhiqui doreah they were there at once my throat is dry she said so dry and they brought her water it was warm and flat yet dany drank it eagerly and sent jhiqui for more irri dampened a soft cloth and stroked her brow i have been sick dany said the dothraki girl nodded how long the cloth was soothing but irri seemed so sad it frightened her eong she whispered when jhiqui returned with more water mirri maz duur came with her eyes heavy from sleep drink she said lifting danys head to the cup once more but this time it was only wine sweet sweet wine dany drank and lay back listening to the soft sound of her own breathing she could feel the heaviness in her limbs as sleep crept in to fill her up once more bring me she murmured her voice slurred and drowsy bring i want to hold yes the maegi asked what is it you wish khaleesi bring me egg dragons egg please her lashes turned to lead and she was too weary to hold them up when she woke the third time a shaft of golden sunlight was pouring through the smoke hole of the tent and her arms were wrapped around a dragons egg it was the pale one its scales the color of butter cream veined with whorls of gold and bronze and dany could feel the heat of it beneath her bedsilks a fine sheen of perspiration covered her bare skin dragondew she thought her fingers trailed lightly across the surface of the shell tracing the wisps of gold and deep in the stone she felt something twist and stretch in response it did not frighten her all her fear was gone burned away page dany touched her brow under the film of sweat her skin was cool to the touch her fever gone she made herself sit there was a moment of dizziness and the deep ache between her thighs yet she felt strong her maids came running at the sound of her voice water she told them a flagon of water cold as you can find it and fruit i think dates as you say khaleesi i want ser jorah she said standing jhiqui brought a sandsilk robe and draped it over her shoulders and a warm bath and mirri maz duur and memory came back to her all at once and she faltered khal drogo she forced herself to say watching their faces with dread is het the khal lives irri answered quietly yet dany saw a darkness in her eyes when she said the words and no sooner had she spoken than she rushed away to fetch water she turned to doreah tell me a i shall bring ser jorah the lysene girl said bowing her head and fleeing the tent jhiqui would have run as well but dany caught her by the wrist and held her captive what is it i must know drogo and my child why had she not remembered the child until now my son rhaego where is he i want him her handmaid lowered her eyes the boy he did not live khaleesi her voice was a frightened whisper dany released her wrist my son is dead she thought as jhiqui left the tent she had known somehow she had known since she woke the first time to jhiquis tears no she had known before she woke her dream came back to her sudden and vivid and she remembered the tall man with the copper skin and long silvergold braid bursting into flame page she should weep she knew yet her eyes were dry as ash she had wept in her dream and the tears had turned to steam on her cheeks all the grief has been burned out of me she told herself she felt sad and yet she could feel rhaego receding from her as if he had never been ser jorah and mirri maz duur entered a few moments later and found dany standing over the other dragons eggs the two still in their chest it seemed to her that they felt as hot as the one she had slept with which was passing strange ser jorah come here she said she took his hand and placed it on the black egg with the scarlet swirls what do you feel shell hard as rock the knight was wary scales heat no cold stone he took his hand away princess are you well should you be up weak as you are weak i am strong jorah to please him she reclined on a pile of cushions tell me how my child died he never lived my princess the women say he faltered and dany saw how the flesh hung loose on him and the way he limped when he moved tell me tell me what the women say he turned his face away his eyes were haunted they say the child was she waited but ser jorah could not say it his face grew dark with shame he looked half a corpse himself page monstrous mirri maz duur finished for him the knight was a powerful man yet dany understood in that moment that the maegi was stronger and crueler and infinitely more dangerous twisted i drew him forth myself he was scaled like a lizard blind with the stub of a tail and small leather wings like the wings of a bat when i touched him the flesh sloughed off the bone and inside he was full of graveworms and the stink of corruption he had been dead for years darkness dany thought the terrible darkness sweeping up behind to devour her if she looked back she was lost my son was alive and strong when ser jorah carried me into this tent she said i could feel him kicking fighting to be born that may be as it may be answered mirri maz duur yet the creature that came forth from your womb was as i said death was in that tent khaleesi only shadows ser jorah husked but dany could hear the doubt in his voice i saw maegi i saw you alone dancing with the shadows the grave casts long shadows iron lord mirri said long and dark and in the end no light can hold them back ser jorah had killed her son dany knew he had done what he did for love and loyalty yet he had carried her into a place no living man should go and fed her baby to the darkness he knew it too the grey face the hollow eyes the limp the shadows have touched you too ser jorah she told him the knight made no reply dany turned to the godswife you warned me that only death could pay for life i thought you meant the horse no mirri maz duur said that was a lie you told yourself you knew the price had she had she if i look back i am lost the price was paid dany said the horse my child quaro and qotho haggo and cohollo the price was paid and paid and paid she rose from her cushions where is khal drogo show him to me godswife maegi bloodmage whatever you are page show me khal drogo show me what i bought with my sons life as you command khaleesi the old woman said come i will take you to him dany was weaker than she knew ser jorah slipped an arm around her and helped her stand time enough for this later my princess he said quietly i would see him now ser jorah after the dimness of the tent the world outside was blinding bright the sun burned like molten gold and the land was seared and empty her handmaids waited with fruit and wine and water and jhogo moved close to help ser jorah support her aggo and rakharo stood behind the glare of sun on sand made it hard to see more until dany raised her hand to shade her eyes she saw the ashes of a fire a few score horses milling listlessly and searching for a bite of grass a scattering of tents and bedrolls a small crowd of children had gathered to watch her and beyond she glimpsed women going about their work and withered old men staring at the flat blue sky with tired eyes swatting feebly at bloodflies a count might show a hundred people no more where the other forty thousand had made their camp only the wind and dust lived now drogos khalasar is gone she said a khal who cannot ride is no khal said jhogo the dothraki follow only the strong ser jorah said i am sorry my princess there was no way to hold them ko pono left first naming himself khal pono and many followed him jhaqo was not long to do the same the rest slipped away night by night in large bands and small there are a dozen new khalasars on the dothraki sea where once there was only drogos page the old remain said aggo the frightened the weak and the sick and we who swore we remain they took khal drogos herds khaleesi rakharo said we were too few to stop them it is the right of the strong to take from the weak they took many slaves as well the khals and yours yet they left some few eroeh asked dany remembering the frightened child she had saved outside the city of the lamb men mago seized her who is khal jhaqos bloodrider now said jhogo he mounted her high and low and gave her to his khal and jhaqo gave her to his other bloodriders they were six when they were done with her they cut her throat it was her fate khaleesi said aggo if i look back i am lost it was a cruel fate dany said yet not so cruel as magos will be i promise you that by the old gods and the new by the lamb god and the horse god and every god that lives i swear it by the mother of mountains and the womb of the world before i am done with them mago and ko jhaqo will plead for the mercy they showed eroeh the dothraki exchanged uncertain glances khaleesi the handmaid irri explained as if to a child jhaqo is a khal now with twenty thousand riders at his back she lifted her head and i am daenerys stormhorn daenerys of house targaryen of the blood of aegon the conqueror and maegor the cruel and old valyria before them i am the dragons daughter and i swear to you these men will die screaming now bring me to khal drogo he was lying on the bare red earth staring up at the sun page a dozen bloodflies had settled on his body though he did not seem to feel them dany brushed them away and knelt beside him his eyes were wide open but did not see and she knew at once that he was blind when she whispered his name he did not seem to hear the wound on his breast was as healed as it would ever be the scar that covered it grey and red and hideous why is he out here alone in the sun she asked them he seems to like the warmth princess ser jorah said his eyes follow the sun though he does not see it he can walk after a fashion he will go where you lead him but no farther he will eat if you put food in his mouth drink if you dribble water on his lips dany kissed her sunandstars gently on the brow and stood to face mirri maz duur your spells are costly maegi he lives said mirri maz duur you asked for life you paid for life this is not life for one who was as drogo was his life was laughter and meat roasting over a firepit and a horse between his legs his life was an arakh in his hand and his bells ringing in his hair as he rode to meet an enemy his life was his bloodriders and me and the son i was to give him mirri maz duur made no reply when will he be as he was dany demanded when the sun rises in the west and sets in the east said mirri maz duur when the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves when your womb quickens again and you bear a living child then he will return and not before dany gestured at ser jorah and the others leave us i would speak with this maegi alone mormont and the dothraki withdrew you knew dany said when they were gone she ached inside and out but page her fury gave her strength you knew what i was buying and you knew the price and yet you let me pay it it was wrong of them to burn my temple the heavy flatnosed woman said placidly that angered the great shepherd this was no gods work dany said coldly if i look back i am lost you cheated me you murdered my child within me the stallion who mounts the world will burn no cities now his khalasar shall trample no nations into dusu i spoke for you she said anguished i saved you saved me the lhazareen woman spat three riders had taken me not as a man takes a woman but from behind as a dog takes a bitch the fourth was in me when you rode past how then did you save me i saw my gods house burn where i had healed good men beyond counting my home they burned as well and in the street i saw piles of heads i saw the head of a baker who made my bread i saw the head of a boy i had saved from deadeye fever only three moons past i heard children crying as the riders drove them off with their whips tell me again what you saved your life mirri maz duur laughed cruelly look to your khal and see what life is worth when all the rest is gone dany called out for the men of her khas and bid them take mirri maz duur and bind her hand and foot but the maegi smiled at her as they carried her off as if they shared a secret a word and dany could have her head off yet then what would she have a head if life was worthless what was death page they led khal drogo back to her tent and dany commanded them to fill a tub and this time there was no blood in the water she bathed him herself washing the dirt and the dust from his arms and chest cleaning his face with a soft cloth soaping his long black hair and combing the knots and tangles from it till it shone again as she remembered it was well past dark before she was done and dany was exhausted she stopped for drink and food but it was all she could do to nibble at a fig and keep down a mouthful of water sleep would have been a release but she had slept enough too long in truth she owed this night to drogo for all the nights that had been and yet might be the memory of their first ride was with her when she led him out into the darkness for the dothraki believed that all things of importance in a mans life must be done beneath the open sky she told herself that there were powers stronger than hatred and spells older and truer than any the maegi had learned in asshai the night was black and moonless but overhead a million stars burned bright she took that for an omen no soft blanket of grass welcomed them here only the hard dusty ground bare and strewn with stones no trees stirred in the wind and there was no stream to soothe her fears with the gentle music of water dany told herself that the stars would be enough remember drogo she whispered remember our first ride together the day we wed remember the night we made rhaego with the khalasar all around us and your eyes on my face remember how cool and clean the water was in the womb of the world remember my sunandstars remember and come back to me the birth had left her too raw and torn to take him inside of her as she would have wanted but doreah had taught her other ways dany used her hands her mouth her breasts she raked him with her nails and covered him with kisses and whispered and prayed and told him stories and by the end she had bathed him with her tears yet drogo did not feel or speak or rise and when the bleak dawn broke over an empty horizon dany knew that he was truly lost to her when the sun rises in the west and sets in the east she said sadly when the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves when my womb quickens again and i bear a living child then you will return my sunandstars and not before page never the darkness cried never never never inside the tent dany found a cushion soft silk stuffed with feathers she clutched it to her breasts as she walked back out to drogo to her sunandstars if i look back i am lost it hurt even to walk and she wanted to sleep to sleep and not to dream she knelt kissed drogo on the lips and pressed the cushion down across his face tyrion they have my son tywin lannister said they do my lord the messengers voice was dulled by texhaustion on the breast of his torn surcoat the brindled boar of crakehall was halfobscured by dried blood one of your sons tyrion thought he took a sip of wine and said not a word thinking of jaime when he lifted his arm pain shot through his elbow reminding him of his own brief taste of battle he loved his brother but he would not have wanted to be with him in the whispering wood for all the gold in casterly rock his lord fathers assembled captains and bannermen had fallen very quiet as the courier told his tale the only sound was the crackle and hiss of the log burning in the hearth at the end of the long drafty common room after the hardships of the long relentless drive south the prospect of even a single night in an inn had cheered tyrion mightily though he rather wished it had not been this inn again with all its memories his father had set a grueling pace and it had taken its toll men wounded in the battle kept up as best they could or were abandoned to fend for themselves every morning they left a few more by the roadside men who went to sleep never to wake every afternoon a few more collapsed along the way and every evening a few more page deserted stealing off into the dusk tyrion had been halftempted to go with them he had been upstairs enjoying the comfort of a featherbed and the warmth of shaes body beside him when his squire had woken him to say that a rider had arrived with dire news of riverrun so it had all been for nothing the rush south the endless forced marches the bodies left beside the road all for naught robb stark had reached riverrun days and days ago how could this happen ser harys swyft moaned how even after the whispering wood you had riverrun ringed in iron surrounded by a great host what madness made ser jaime decide to split his men into three separate camps surely he knew how vulnerable that would leave them better than you you chinless craven tyrion thought jaime might have lost riverrun but it angered him to hear his brother slandered by the likes of swyft a shameless lickspittle whose greatest accomplishment was marrying his equally chinless daughter to ser kevan and thereby attaching himself to the lannisters i would have done the same his uncle responded a good deal more calmly than tyrion might have you have never seen riverrun ser harys or you would know that jaime had little choice in the matter the castle is situated at the end of the point of land where the tumblestone flows into the red fork of the trident the rivers form two sides of a triangle and when danger threatens the tullys open their sluice gates upstream to create a wide moat on the third side turning riverrun into an island the walls rise sheer from the water and from their towers the defenders have a commanding view of the opposite shores for many leagues around to cut off all the approaches a besieger must needs place one camp north of the tumblestone one south of the red fork and a third between the rivers west of the moat there is no other way none ser kevan speaks truly my lords the courier said wed built palisades of sharpened stakes around the camps yet it was not enough not with no warning and the rivers cutting us off from each other they came down on the north camp first no one was expecting an attack marq piper had been raiding our supply trains but he had no more than fifty men ser jaime had gone out to deal with them the night before well with what we thought was them we were told the stark host was east of the green fork marching south and your outriders ser gregor cleganes face might have been hewn from rock the fire in the hearth page gave a somber orange cast to his skin and put deep shadows in the hollows of his eyes they saw nothing they gave you no warning the bloodstained messenger shook his head our outriders had been vanishing marq pipers work we thought the ones who did come back had seen nothing a man who sees nothing has no use for his eyes the mountain declared cut them out and give them to your next outrider tell him you hope that four eyes might see better than two and if not the man after him will have six lord tywin lannister turned his face to study ser gregor tyrion saw a glimmer of gold as the light shone off his fathers pupils but he could not have said whether the look was one of approval or disgust lord tywin was oft quiet in council preferring to listen before he spoke a habit tyrion himself tried to emulate yet this silence was uncharacteristic even for him and his wine was untouched you said they came at night ser kevan prompted the man gave a weary nod the blacklish led the van cutting down our sentries and clearing away the palisades for the main assault by the time our men knew what was happening riders were pouring over the ditch banks and galloping through the camp with swords and torches in hand i was sleeping in the west camp between the rivers when we heard the fighting and saw the tents being fired lord brax led us to the rafts and we tried to pole across but the current pushed us downstream and the tullys started flinging rocks at us with the catapults on their walls i saw one raft smashed to kindling and three others overturned men swept into the river and drowned and those who did make it across found the starks waiting for them on the riverbanks ser flement brax wore a silverandpurple tabard and the look of a man who cannot comprehend what he has just heard my lord father page sorry my lord the messenger said lord brax was clad in plateandmail when his raft overturned he was very gallant he was a fool tyrion thought swirling his cup and staring down into the winy depths crossing a river at night on a crude raft wearing armor with an enemy waiting on the other sideif that was gallantry he would take cowardice every time he wondered if lord brax had felt especially gallant as the weight of his steel pulled him under the black water the camp between the rivers was overrun as well the messenger was saying while we were trying to cross more starks swept in from the west two columns of armored horse i saw lord umbers giantin chains and the mallister eagle but it was the boy who led them with a monstrous wolf running at his side i wasnt there to see but its said the beast killed four men and ripped apart a dozen horses our spearmen formed up a shieldwall and held against their first charge but when the tullys saw them engaged they opened the gates of riverrun and tytos blackwood led a sortie across the drawbridge and took them in the rear gods save us lord lefford swore greatjon umber fired the siege towers we were building and lord blackwood found ser edmure tully in chains among the other captives and made off with them all our south camp was under the command of ser forley prester he retreated in good order when he saw that the other camps were lost with two thousand spears and as many bowmen but the tyroshi sellsword who led his freeriders struck his banners and went over to the foe curse the man his uncle kevan sounded more angry than surprised i warned jaime not to trust that one a man who fights for coin is loyal only to his purse lord tywin wove his fingers together under his chin only his eyes moved as he listened his bristling golden sidewhiskers framed a face so still it might have been a mask but tyrion could see tiny beads of sweat dappling his fathers shaven head page how could it happen ser harys swyft wailed again ser jaime taken the siege broken this is a catastrophe ser addarn marbrand said i am sure we are all grateful to you for pointing out the obvious ser harys the question is what shall we do about it what can we do jaimes host is all slaughtered or taken or put to flight and the starks and the tullys sit squarely across our line of supply we are cut off from the west they can march on casterly rock if they so choose and whats to stop them my lords we are beaten we must sue for peace peace tyrion swirled his wine thoughtfully took a deep draft and hurled his empty cup to the floor where it shattered into a thousand pieces theres your peace ser harys my sweet nephew broke it for good and all when he decided to ornament the red keep with lord eddards head youll have an easier time drinking wine from that cup than you will convincing robb stark to make peace now hes winning or hadnt you noticed two battles do not make a war ser addam insisted we are far from lost i should welcome the chance to try my own steel against this stark boy perhaps they would consent to a truce and allow us to trade our prisoners for theirs offered lord lefford unless they trade threeforone we still come out light on those scales tyrion said acidly and what are we to offer for my brother lord eddards rotting head i had heard that queen cersei has the hands daughters lefford said hopefully if we give the lad his sisters back ser addam snorted disdainfully he would have to be an utter ass to trade jaime lannisters life for two girls page then we must ransom ser jaime whatever it costs lord lefford said tyrion rolled his eyes if the starks feel the need for gold they can melt down jaimes armor if we ask for a truce they will think us weak ser addarn argued we should march on them at once surely our friends at court could be prevailed upon to join us with fresh troops said ser harys and someone might return to casterly rock to raise a new host lord tywin lannister rose to his feet they have my son he said once more in a voice that cut through the babble like a sword through suet leave me all of you ever the soul of obedience tyrion rose to depart with the rest but his father gave him a look not you tyrion remain and you as well kevan the rest of you out tyrion eased himself back onto the bench startled into speechlessness ser kevan crossed the room to the wine casks uncle tyrion called if you would be so kind here his father offered him his cup the wine untouched now tyrion truly was nonplussed he drank lord tywin seated himself you have the right of it about stark alive we might have used lord eddard to forge a peace with winterfell and riverrun a peace that would have given us the time we need to deal with roberts brothers dead his hand curled into a fist madness rank madness joffs only a boy tyrion pointed out at his age i committed a few follies of my own page his father gave him a sharp look i suppose we ought to be grateful that he has not yet married a whore tyrion sipped at his wine wondering how lord tywin would look if he flung the cup in his face our position is worse than you know his father went on it would seem we have a new king ser kevan looked poleaxed a newwho what have they done to joffrey the faintest flicker of distaste played across lord tywins thin lips nothing yet my grandson still sits the iron throne but the eunuch has heard whispers from the south renly baratheon wed margaery tyrell at highgarden this fortnight past and now he has claimed the crown the brides father and brothers have bent the knee and sworn him their swords those are grave tidings when ser kevan frowned the furrows in his brow grew deep as canyons my daughter commands us to ride for kings landing at once to defend the red keep against king renly and the knight of flowers his mouth tightened commands us mind you in the name of the king and council how is king joffrey taking the news tyrion asked with a certain black amusement cersei has not seen fit to tell him yet lord tywin said she fears he might insist on marching against renly himself with what army tyrion asked you dont plan to give him this one i hope page he talks of leading the city watch lord tywin said if he takes the watch hell leave the city undefended ser kevan said and with lord stannis on dragonstone yes lord tywin looked down at his son i had thought you were the one made for motley tyrion but it would appear that i was wrong why father said tyrion that almost sounds like praise he leaned forward intently what of stannis hes the elder not renly how does he feel about his brothers claim his father frowned i have felt from the beginning that stannis was a greater danger than all the others combined yet he does nothing oh varys hears his whispers stannis is building ships stannis is hiring sellswords stannis is bringing a shadowbinder from asshai what does it mean is any of it true he gave an irritated shrug kevan bring us the map ser kevan did as he was bid lord tywin unrolled the leather smoothing it flat jaime has left us in a bad way roose bolton and the remnants of his host are north of us our enemies hold the twins and moat cailin robb stark sits to the west so we cannot retreat to lannisport and the rock unless we choose to give battle jaime is taken and his army for all purposes has ceased to exist thoros of myr and beric dondarrion continue to plague our foraging parties to our east we have the arryns stannis baratheon sits on dragonstone and in the south highgarden and storms end are calling their banners tyrion smiled crookedly take heart father at least rhaegar targaryen is still dead i had hoped you might have more to offer us than japes tyrion lord tywin lannister said page ser kevan frowned over the map forehead creasing robb stark will have edmure tully and the lords of the trident with him now their combined power may exceed our own and with roose bolton behind us tywin if we remain here i fear we might be caught between three armies i have no intention of remaining here we must finish our business with young lord stark before renly baratheon can march from highgarden bolton does not concern me he is a wary man and we made him warier on the green fork he will be slow to give pursuit so on the morrow we make for harrenhal kevan i want ser addams outriders to screen our movements give him as many men as he requires and send them out in groups of four i will have no vanishings as you say my lord but why harrenhal that is a grim unlucky place some call it cursed let them lord tywin said unleash ser gregor and send him before us with his reavers send forth vargo hoat and his freeriders as well and ser amory lorch each is to have three hundred horse tell them i want to see the riverlands afire from the gods eye to the red fork they will burn my lord ser kevan said rising i shall give the commands he bowed and made for the door when they were alone lord tywin glanced at tyrion your savages might relish a bit of rapine tell them they may ride with vargo hoat and plunder as they likegoods stock women they may take what they want and burn the rest telling shagga and timett how to pillage is like telling a rooster how to crow tyrion commented but i should prefer to keep them with me uncouth and unruly they might be yet the wildlings were his and he trusted them more than any of his fathers men he was not about to hand them over then you had best learn to control them i will not have the city plundered the city tyrion was lost what city would that be page kings landing i am sending you to court it was the last thing tyrion lannister would ever have anticipated he reached for his wine and considered for a moment as he sipped and what am i to do there rule his father said curtly tyrion hooted with laughter my sweet sister might have a word or two to say about that let her say what she likes her son needs to be taken in hand before he ruins us all i blame those jackanapes on the councilour friend petyr the venerable grand maester and that cockless wonder lord varys what sort of counsel are they giving joffrey when he lurches from one folly to the next whose notion was it to make this janos slynt a lord the mans father was a butcher and they grant him harrenhal harrenhal that was the seat of kings not that he will ever set foot inside it if i have a say i am told he took a bloody spear for his sigil a bloody cleaver would have been my choice his father had not raised his voice yet irion could see the anger in the gold of his eyes and dismissing selmy where was the sense in that yes the man was old but the name of barristan the bold still has meaning in the realm he lent honor to any man he served can anyone say the same of the hound you feed your dog bones under the table you do not seat him beside you on the high bench he pointed a finger at tyrions face if cersei cannot curb the boy you must and if these councillors are playing us false tyrion knew spikes he sighed heads walls i see you have taken a few lessons from me more than you know father tyrion answered quietly he finished his wine and set the cup aside thoughtful a part of him was more pleased than he cared to admit another part was remembering the battle upriver and wondering if he was being sent to hold the left again why me he asked cocking his head to one side why not my uncle why not ser addam or ser flement or lord serrett why not a page bigger man lord tywin rose abruptly you are my son that was when he knew you have given him up for lost he thought you bloody bastard you think jaimes good as dead so im all you have left rion wanted to slap him to spit in his face to draw his dagger and cut the heart out of him and see if it was made of old hard gold the way the smallfolks said yet he sat there silent and still the shards of the broken cup crunched beneath his fathers heels as lord tywin crossed the room one last thing he said at the door you will not take the whore to court tyrion sat alone in the common room for a long while after his father was gone finally he climbed the steps to his cozy garret beneath the bell tower the ceiling was low but that was scarcely a drawback for a dwarf from the window he could see the gibbet his father had erected in the yard the innkeeps body turned slowly on its rope whenever the night wind gusted her flesh had grown as thin and ragged as lannister hopes shae murmured sleepily and rolled toward him when he sat on the edge of the featherbed he slid his hand under the blanket and cupped a soft breast and her eyes opened mlord she said with a drowsy smile when he felt her nipple stiffen tyrion kissed her i have a mind to take you to kings landing sweetling he whispered jon page the mare whickered softly as jon snow tightened the cinch easy sweet lady he said in a soft voice quieting her with a touch wind whispered through the stable a cold dead breath on his face but jon paid it no mind he strapped his roll to the saddle his scarred fingers stiff and clumsy ghost he called softly to me and the wolf was there eyes like embers jon please you must not do this he mounted the reins in his hand and wheeled the horse around to face the night samwell tarly stood in the stable door a full moon peering over his shoulder he threw a giants shadow immense and black get out of my way sam jon you cant sam said i wont let you i would sooner not hurt you jon told him move aside sam or ill ride you down you wont you have to listen to me please jon put his spurs to horseflesh and the mare bolted for the door for an instant sam stood his ground his face as round and pale as the moon behind him his mouth a widening of surprise at the last moment when they were almost on him he jumped aside as jon had known he would stumbled and fell the mare leapt over him out into the night jon raised the hood of his heavy cloak and gave the horse her head castle black was silent and still as he rode out with ghost racing at his side men watched from the wall behind him he knew but their eyes were turned north not south no one would see him go no one but sam tarly struggling back to his feet in the dust of the old stables he hoped sam hadnt hurt himself falling like that he was so heavy and so ungainly it would be just like him to break a wrist or twist his ankle getting out of the way i warned him jon said aloud it was nothing to do with him anyway he flexed his burned hand as he rode opening and closing the scarred fingers they still pained him but it page felt good to have the wrappings off moonlight silvered the hills as he followed the twisting ribbon of the kingsroad he needed to get as far from the wall as he could before they realized he was gone on the morrow he would leave the road and strike out overland through field and bush and stream to throw off pursuit but for the moment speed was more important than deception it was not as though they would not guess where he was going the old bear was accustomed to rise at first light so jon had until dawn to put as many leagues as he could between him and the wall if sam tarly did not betray him the fat boy was dutiful and easily frightened but he loved jon like a brother if questioned sam would doubtless tell them the truth but jon could not imagine him braving the guards in front of the mngs tower to wake mormont from sleep when jon did not appear to fetch the old bears breakfast from the kitchen theyd look in his cell and find longclaw on the bed it had been hard to abandon it but jon was not so lost to honor as to take it with him even jorah mormont had not done that when he fled in disgrace doubtless lord mormont would find someone more worthy of the blade jon felt bad when he thought of the old man he knew his desertion would be salt in the stillraw wound of his sons disgrace that seemed a poor way to repay him for his trust but it couldnt be helped no matter what he did jon felt as though he were betraying someone even now he did not know if he was doing the honorable thing the southron had it easier they had their septons to talk to someone to tell them the gods will and help sort out right from wrong but the starks worshiped the old gods the nameless gods and if the heart trees heard they did not speak when the last lights of castle black vanished behind him jon slowed his mare to a walk he had a long journey ahead and only the one horse to see him through there were holdfasts and farming villages along the road south where he might be able to trade the mare for a fresh mount when he needed one but not if she were injured or blown he would need to find new clothes soon most like hed need to steal them he was clad in black from head to heel high leather riding boots roughspun breeches and tunic sleeveless leather jerkin and heavy wool cloak his longsword and dagger were sheathed in black moleskin and the hauberk and coif in his page saddlebag were black ringmail any bit of it could mean his death if he were taken a stranger wearing black was viewed with cold suspicion in every village and holdfast north of the neck and men would soon be watching for him once maester aemons ravens took flight jon knew he would find no safe haven not even at winterfell bran might want to let him in but maester luwin had better sense he would bar the gates and send jon away as he should better not to call there at all yet he saw the castle clear in his minds eye as if he had left it only yesterday the towering granite walls the great hall with its smells of smoke and dog and roasting meat his fathers solar the turret room where he had slept part of him wanted nothing so much as to hear bran laugh again to sup on one of gages beefandbacon pies to listen to old nan tell her tales of the children of the forest and florian the fool but he had not left the wall for that he had left because he was after all his fathers son and robbs brother the gift of a sword even a sword as fine as longclaw did not make him a mormont nor was he aemon targaryen three times the old man had chosen and three times he had chosen honor but that was him even now jon could not decide whether the maester had stayed because he was weak and craven or because he was strong and true yet he understood what the old man had meant about the pain of choosing he understood that all too well tyrion lannister had claimed that most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it but jon was done with denials he was who he was jon snow bastard and oathbreaker motherless friendless and damned for the rest of his lifehowever long that might behe would be condemned to be an outsider the silent man standing in the shadows who dares not speak his true name wherever he might go throughout the seven kingdoms he would need to live a lie lest every mans hand be raised against him but it made no matter so long as he lived long enough to take his place by his brothers side and help avenge his father he remembered robb as he had last seen him standing in the yard with snow melting in his auburn hair jon would have to come to him in secret disguised he tried to imagine the look on robbs face when he revealed himself his brother would shake his head and smile and hed say hed say he could not see the smile hard as he tried he could not see it he found himself thinking of the deserter his father had beheaded the day theyd found the direwolves you said the words lord page eddard had told him you took a vow before your brothers before the old gods and the new desmond and fat tom had dragged the man to the stump brans eyes had been wide as saucers and jon had to remind him to keep his pony in hand he remembered the look on fathers face when theon greyjoy brought forth ice the spray of blood on the snow the way theon had kicked the head when it came rolling at his feet he wondered what lord eddard might have done if the deserter had been his brother benjen instead of that ragged stranger would it have been any different it must surely surely and robb would welcome him for a certainty he had to or else it did not bear thinking about pain throbbed deep in his fingers as he clutched the reins jon put his heels into his horse and broke into a gallop racing down the kingsroad as if to outrun his doubts jon was not afraid of death but he did not want to die like that trussed and bound and beheaded like a common brigand if he must perish let it be with a sword in his hand fighting his fathers killers he was no true stark had never been one but he could die like one let them say that eddard stark had fathered four sons not three ghost kept pace with them for almost half a mile red tongue lolling from his mouth man and horse alike lowered their heads as he asked the mare for more speed the wolf slowed stopped watching his eyes glowing red in the moonlight he vanished behind but jon knew he would follow at his own pace scattered lights flickered through the trees ahead of him on both sides of the road moles town a dog barked as he rode through and he heard a mules raucous haw from the stable but otherwise the village was still here and there the glow of hearth fires shone through shuttered windows leaking between wooden slats but only a few moles town was bigger than it seemed but three quarters of it was under the ground in deep warm cellars connected by a maze of tunnels even the whorehouse was down there nothing on the surface but a wooden shack no bigger than a privy with a red lantern hung over the door on the wall hed heard men call the whores buried treasures he wondered whether any of his brothers in black were down a game of fhrones there tonight mining that was oathbreaking too yet no one seemed to care page not until he was well beyond the village did jon slow again by then both he and the mare were damp with sweat he dismounted shivering his burned hand aching a bank of melting snow lay under the trees bright in the moonlight water trickling off to form small shallow pools jon squatted and brought his hands together cupping the runoff between his fingers the snowmelt was icy cold he drank and splashed some on his face until his cheeks tingled his fingers were throbbing worse than they had in days and his head was pounding too i am doing the right thing he told himself so why do i feel so bad the horse was well lathered so jon took the lead and walked her for a while the road was scarcely wide enough for two riders to pass abreast its surface cut by tiny streams and littered with stone that run had been truly stupid an invitation to a broken neck jon wondered what had gotten into him was he in such a great rush to die off in the trees the distant scream of some frightened animal made him look up his mare whinnied nervously had his wolf found some prey he cupped his hands around his mouth ghost he shouted ghost to me the only answer was a rush of wings behind him as an owl took flight frowning jon continued on his way he led the mare for half an hour until she was dry ghost did not appear jon wanted to mount up and ride again but he was concerned about his missing wolf ghost he called again where are you to me ghost nothing in these woods could trouble a direwolf even a halfgrown direwolf unless no ghost was too smart to attack a bear and if there was a wolf pack anywhere close jon would have surely heard them howling he should eat he decided food would settle his stomach and give ghost the chance to catch up there was no danger yet castle black still slept in his saddlebag he found a biscuit a piece of cheese and a small withered brown apple hed brought salt beef as well and a rasher of bacon hed filched from the kitchens but he would save the meat for the morrow after it was gone hed need to hunt and that would slow him jon sat under the trees and ate his biscuit and cheese while his mare grazed along the kingsroad he kept the apple for last it had gone a little soft but the flesh was still tart and juicy he was down to the core when he heard the sounds horses and from the north quickly jon leapt up and strode to his mare could he outrun them no they were too close theyd hear him for a certainty and if they were from castle black he led the mare off the road behind a thick stand of greygreen sentinels ouiet now he said in a page hushed voice crouching down to peer through the branches if the gods were kind the riders would pass by likely as not they were only smallfolk from moles town farmers on their way to their fields although what they were doing out in the middle of the night he listened to the sound of hooves growing steadily louder as they trotted briskly down the kingsroad from the sound there were five or six of them at the least their voices drifted through the trees certain he came this way we cant be certain he could have ridden east for all you know or left the road to cut through the woods thats what id do in the dark stupid if you didnt fall off your horse and break your neck youd get lost and wind up back at the wall when the sun came up i would not grenn sounded peeved id just ride south you can tell south by the stars what if the sky was cloudy pyp asked then i wouldnt go another voice broke in you know where id be if it was me id be in moles town digging for buried treasure toads shrill laughter boomed through the trees jons mare snorted keep quiet all of you haider said i thought i heard something where i didnt hear anything the horses stopped page you cant hear yourself fart i can too grenn insisted quiet they all fell silent listening jon found himself holding his breath sam he thought he hadnt gone to the old bear but he hadnt gone to bed either hed woken the other boys damn them all come dawn if they were not in their beds theyd be named deserters too what did they think they were doing the hushed silence seemed to stretch on and on from where jon crouched he could see the legs of their horses through the branches finally pyp spoke up what did you hear i dont know haider admitted a sound i thought it might have been a horse but theres nothing here out of the corner of his eye jon glimpsed a pale shape moving through the trees leaves rustled and ghost came bounding out of the shadows so suddenly that jons mare started and gave a whinny there halder shouted i heard it too page traitor jon told the direwolf as he swung up into the saddle he turned the mares head to slide off through the trees but they were on him before he had gone ten feet jon pyp shouted after him pull up grenn said you cant outrun us all jon wheeled around to face them drawing his sword get back i dont wish to hurt you but i will if i have to one against seven halder gave a signal the boys spread out surrounding him what do you want with me jon demanded we want to take you back where you belong pyp said i belong with my brother were your brothers now grenn said theyll cut off your head if they catch you you know toad put in with a nervous laugh this is so stupid its like something the aurochs would do i would not grenn said im no oathbreaker i said the words and i meant them so did u jon told them dont you understand they murdered my father its war my brother robb is fighting in the riverlands page we know said pyp solemnly sam told us everything were sorry about your father grenn said but it doesnt matter once you say the words you cant leave no matter what i have to jon said fervently you said the words pyp reminded him now my watch begins you said it it shall not end until my death i shall live and die at my post grenn added nodding you dont have to tell me the words i know them as well as you do he was angry now why couldnt they let him go in peace they were only making it harder i am the sword in the darkness halder intoned the watcher on the walls piped toad jon cursed them all to their faces they took no notice pyp spurred his horse closer reciting i am the fire that bums against the cold the light that brings the dawn the hom that wakes the sleepers the shield that guards the realms of men stay back jon warned him brandishing his sword i mean it pyp they werent even wearing armor he could cut them to pieces if he had to page matthar had circled behind him he joined the chorus ipledge my life and honor to the nights watch jon kicked his mare spinning her in a circle the boys were all around him now closing from every side for this night halder trotted in from the left and all the nights to come finished pyp he reached over for jons reins so here are your choices kill me or come back with me jon lifted his sword and lowered it helpless damn you he said damn you all do we have to bind your hands or will you give us your word youll ride back peaceful asked halder i wont run if thats what you mean ghost moved out from under the trees and jon glared at him small help you were he said the deep red eyes looked at him knowingly we had best hurry pyp said if were not back before first light the old bear will have all our heads of the ride back jon snow remembered little it seemed shorter than the journey south perhaps because his mind was elsewhere pyp set the pace galloping walking trotting and then breaking into another gallop moles town came and went the red lantern over the brothel long extinguished they made good time dawn was still an hour off when jon glimpsed the towers of castle black ahead of them dark against the pale immensity of the wall it did not seem like home this time they could take him back jon told himself but they could not make him stay the war would not end on the morrow or the day after and his friends could not watch him day and night he would bide his time make them think he was content to remain here and then when they had grown lax he would be off again next time he would avoid the kingsroad he could follow the wall east perhaps all the way to the sea a longer route but a safer one or even west to the mountains and then south over the high passes that was the wildlings way hard and perilous but at least no one wouid follow him he wouldnt stray within a hundred leagues of winterfell or the kingsroad page samwell tarly awaited them in the old stables slumped on the ground against a bale of hay too anxious to sleep he rose and brushed himself off i im glad they found you jon ipm not jon said dismounting pyp hopped off his horse and looked at the lightening sky with disgust give us a hand bedding down the horses sam the small boy said we have a long day before us and no sleep to face it on thanks to lord snow when day broke jon walked to the kitchens as he did every dawn threefinger hobb said nothing as he gave him the old bears breakfast today it was three brown eggs boiled hard with fried bread and ham steak and a bowl of wrinkled plums jon carried the food back to the kings tower he found mormont at the window seat writing his raven was walking back and forth across his shoulders muttering corn corn corn the bird shrieked when jon entered put the food on the table the old bear said glancing up ill have some beer jon opened a shuttered window took the flagon of beer off the outside ledge and filled a horn hobb had given him a lemon still cold from the wall jon crushed it in his fist the juice trickled through his fingers mormont drank lemon in his beer every day and claimed that was why he still had his own teeth doubtless you loved your father mormont said when jon brought him his horn the things we love destroy us every time lad remember when i told you that i remember jon said sullenly he did not care to talk of his fathers death not even to mormont see that you never forget it the hard truths are the ones to hold tight fetch me my plate is it ham again so be it you look weary was your moonlight ride so tiring page jons throat was dry you know know the raven echoed from mormonts shoulder know the old bear snorted do you think they chose me lord commander of the nights watch because im dumb as a stump snow aemon told me youd go i told him youd be back i know my men and my boys too honor set you on the kingsroad and honor brought you back my friends brought me back jon said did i say it was your honor mormont inspected his plate they killed my father did you expect me to do nothing if truth be told we expected you to do just as you did mormont tried a plum spit out the pit i ordered a watch kept over you you were seen leaving if your brothers had not fetched you back you would have been taken along the way and not by friends unless you have a horse with wings like a raven do you no jon felt like a fool pity we could use a horse like that jon stood tall he told himself that he would die well that much he page could do at the least i know the penalty for desertion my lord im not afraid to die die the raven cried nor live i hope mormont said cutting his ham with a dagger and feeding a bite to the bird you have not desertedyet here you stand if we beheaded every boy who rode to moles town in the night only ghosts would guard the wall yet maybe you mean to flee again on the morrow or a fortnight from now is that it is that your hope boy jon kept silent i thought so mormont peeled the shell off a boiled egg your father is dead lad do you think you can bring him back no he answered sullen good mormont said weve seen the dead come back you and me and its not something i care to see again he ate the egg in two bites and flicked a bit of shell out from between his teeth your brother is in the field with all the power of the north behind him any one of his lords bannermen commands more swords than youll find in all the nights watch why do you imagine that they need your help are you such a mighty warrior or do you carry a grumkin in your pocket to magic up your sword jon had no answer for him the raven was pecking at an egg breaking the shell pushing his beak through the hole he pulled out morsels of white and yoke the old bear sighed you are not the only one touched by this war like as not my sister is marching in your brothers host her and those daughters of hers dressed in mens mail maege is a hoary old snark stubborn shorttempered and willful truth be told i can hardly stand to be around the wretched woman but that does not mean my love for her is any less than the love you bear your half sisters frowning mormont took his last egg and squeezed it in his fist until the shell crunched or perhaps it does be that as it may id still grieve if she were slain yet you dont see me running off i said the words just as you did my place is here where is yours boy page i have no place jon wanted to say im a bastard i have no rights no name no mother and now not even a father the words would not come i dont know i do said lord commander mormont the cold winds are rising snow beyond the wall the shadows lengthen cotter pyke writes of vast herds of elk streaming south and east toward the sea and mammoths as well he says one of his men discovered huge misshapen footprints not three leagues from eastwatch rangers from the shadow tower have found whole villages abandoned and at night ser denys says they see fires in the mountains huge blazes that burn from dusk till dawn quorin halfhand took a captive in the depths of the gorge and the man swears that mance rayder is massing all his people in some new secret stronghold hes found to what end the gods only know do you think your uncle benjen was the only ranger weve lost this past year ben jen the raven squawked bobbing its head bits of egg dribbling from its beak ben jen ben jen no jon said there had been others too many do you think your brothers war is more important than ours the old man barked jon chewed his lip the raven flapped its wings at him war war war war it sang its not mormont told him gods save us boy youre not blind and youre not stupid when dead men come hunting in the night do you think it matters who sits the iron throne no jon had not thought of it that way your lord father sent you to us jon why who can say page y why why the raven called all i know is that the blood of the first men flows in the veins of the starks the first men built the wall and its said they remember things otherwise forgotten and that beast of yours he led us to the wights warned you of the dead man on the steps ser jaremy would doubtless call that happenstance yet ser jaremy is dead and im not lord mormont stabbed a chunk of ham with the point of his dagger i think you were meant to be here and i want you and that wolf of yours with us when we go beyond the wall his words sent a chill of excitement down jons back beyond the wall you heard me i mean to find ben stark alive or dead he chewed and swallowed i will not sit here meekly and wait for the snows and the ice winds we must know what is happening this time the nights watch will ride in force against the kingbeyondthewall the others and anything else that may be out there i mean to command them myself he pointed his dagger at jons chest by custom the lord commanders steward is his squire as well but i do not care to wake every dawn wondering if youve run off again so i will have an answer from you lord snow and i will have it now are you a brother of the nights watch or only a bastard boy who wants to play at war jon snow straightened himself and took a long deep breath forgive me father robb arya bran forgive me i cannot help you he has the truth of it this is my place i am yours my lord your man i swear it i will not run again the old bear snorted good now go put on your sword catelyn it seemed a thousand years ago that catelyn stark had carried her infant son out of riverrun crossing page the tumblestone in a small boat to begin their journey north to winterfell and it was across the tumblestone that they came home now though the boy wore plate and mail in place of swaddling clothes robb sat in the bow with grey wind his hand resting on his direwolf s head as the rowers pulled at their oars theon greyjoy was with him her uncle brynden would come behind in the second boat with the greatjon and lord karstark catelyn took a place toward the stern they shot down the tumblestone letting the strong current push them past the looming wheel tower the splash and rumble of the great waterwheel within was a sound from her girlhood that brought a sad smile to catelyns face from the sandstone walls of the castle soldiers and servants shouted down her name and robbs and winterfell from every rampart waved the banner of house tully a leaping trout silver against a rippling blueandred field it was a stirring sight yet it did not lift her heart she wondered if indeed her heart would ever lift again oh ned below the wheel tower they made a wide turn and knifed through the churning water the men put their backs into it the wide arch of the water gate came into view and she heard the creak of heavy chains as the great iron portcullis was winched upward it rose slowly as they approached and catelyn saw that the lower half of it was red with rust the bottom foot dripped brown mud on them as they passed underneath the barbed spikes mere inches above their heads catelyn gazed up at the bars and wondered how deep the rust went and how well the portcullis would stand up to a ram and whether it ought to be replaced thoughts like that were seldom far from her mind these days they passed beneath the arch and under the walls moving from sunlight to shadow and back into sunlight boats large and small were tied up all around them secured to iron rings set in the stone her fathers guards waited on the water stair with her brother ser edmure tully was a stocky young man with a shaggy head of auburn hair and a fiery beard his breastplate was scratched and dented from battle his blueandred cloak stained by blood and smoke at his side stood the lord itos blackwood a hard pike of a man with closecropped saltandpepper whiskers and a hook nose his bright yellow armor was inlaid with jet in elaborate vineandleaf patterns and a cloak sewn from raven feathers draped his thin shoulders it had been lord jtos who led the sortie that plucked her brother from the lannister camp bring them in ser edmure commanded three men scrambled down the stairs kneedeep in the water page and pulled the boat close with long hooks when grey wind bounded out one of them dropped his pole and lurched back stumbling and sitting down abruptly in the river the others laughed and the man got a sheepish look on his face theon greyjoy vaulted over the side of the boat and lifted catelyn by the waist setting her on a dry step above him as water lapped around his boots edmure came down the steps to embrace her sweet sister he murmured hoarsely he had deep blue eyes and a mouth made for smiles but he was not smiling now he looked worn and tired battered by battle and haggard from strain his neck was bandaged where he had taken a wound catelyn hugged him fiercely your grief is mine cat he said when they broke apart when we heard about lord eddard the lannisters will pay i swear it you will have your vengeance will that bring ned back to me she said sharply the wound was still too fresh for softer words she could not think about ned now she would not it would not do she had to be strong all that will keep i must see father he awaits you in his solar edmure said lord hoster is bedridden my lady her fathers steward ex plained when had that good man grown so old and grey he instructed me to bring you to him at once ill take her edmure escorted her up the water stair and across the lower bailey where petyr baelish and brandon stark had once crossed swords for her favor the massive sandstone walls of the keep loomed above them as they pushed through a door between two guardsmen in fishcrest helms she asked how bad is he dreading the answer even as she said the words edmures look was somber he will not be with us long the maesters say the pain is constant and grievous page a blind rage filled her a rage at all the world at her brother edmure and her sister lysa at the lannisters at the maesters at ned and her father and the monstrous gods who would take them both away from her you should have told me she said you should have sent word as soon as you knew he forbade it he did not want his enemies to know that he was dying with the realm so troubled he feared that if the lannisters suspected how frail he was they might attack catelyn finished hard it was your doing yours a voice whispered inside her ifyou had not taken it upon yourself to seize the dwarf they climbed the spiral stair in silence the keep was threesided like riverrun itself and lord hosters solar was triangular as well with a stone balcony that jutted out to the east like the prow of some great sandstone ship from there the lord of the castle could look down on his walls and battlements and beyond to where the waters met they had moved her fathers bed out onto the balcony he likes to sit in the sun and watch the rivers edmure explained father see who ive brought cat has come to see you hoster tully had always been a big man tall and broad in his youth portly as he grew older now he seemed shrunken the muscle and meat melted off his bones even his face sagged the last time catelyn had seen him his hair and beard had been brown well streaked with grey now they had gone white as snow his eyes opened to the sound of edmures voice little cat he murmured in a voice thin and wispy and wracked by pain my little cat a tremulous smile touched his face as his hand groped for hers i watched for you i shall leave you to talk her brother said kissing their lord father gently on the brow before he withdrew catelyn knelt and took her fathers hand in hers it was a big hand page but fleshless now the bones moving loosely under the skin all the strength gone from it you should have told me she said a rider a raven riders are taken questioned he answered ravens are brought down a spasm of pain took him and his fingers clutched hers hard the crabs are in my belly pinching always pinching day and night they have fierce claws the crabs maester vyman makes me dreamwine milk of the poppy i sleep a lot but i wanted to be awake to see you when you came i was afraid when the lannisters took your brother the camps all around us was afraid i would go before i could see you again i was afraid im here father she said with robb my son hell want to see you too your boy he whispered he had my eyes i remember he did and does and weve brought you jaime lannister in irons riverrun is free again father lord hoster smiled i saw last night when it began i told them had to see they carried me to the gatehouse watched from the battlements ah that was beautiful the torches came in a wave i could hear the cries floating across the river sweet cries when that siege tower went up gods would have died then and glad if only i could have seen you children first was it your boy who did it was it your robb yes catelyn said fiercely proud it was robb and brynden your brother is here as well my lord him her fathers voice was a faint whisper the blackfish came back from the vale yes page and lysa a cool wind moved through his thin white hair gods be good your sister did she come as well he sounded so full of hope and yearning that it was hard to tell the truth no im sorry oh his face fell and some light went out of his eyes id hoped i would have liked to see her before shes with her son in the eyrie lord hoster gave a weary nod lord robert now poor arryns gone i remember why did she not come with you she is frightened my lord in the eyrie she feels safe she kissed his wrinkled brow robb will be waiting will you see him and brynden your son he whispered yes cats child he had my eyes i remember when he was born bring him yes and your brother her father glanced out over the rivers blackfish he said has he wed yet taken some girl to wife even on his deathbed catelyn thought sadly he has not wed you know that father nor will he ever page i told him commanded him marry i was his lord he knows my right to make his match a good match a redwyne old house sweet girl pretty freckles bethany yes poor child still waiting yes still bethany redwyne wed lord rowan years ago catelyn reminded him she has three children by him even so lord hoster muttered even so spit on the girl the redwynes spit on me his lord his brother that blackfish i had other offers lord brackens girl walder frey any of three he said has he wed anyone anyone no one catelyn said yet he has come many leagues to see you fighting his way back to riverrun i would not be here now if ser brynden had not helped us he was ever a warrior her father husked that he could do knight of the gate yes he leaned back and closed his eyes inutterably weary send him later ill sleep now too sick to fight send him up later the blackfish catelyn kissed him gently smoothed his hair and left him there in the shade of his keep with his rivers flowing beneath he was asleep before she left the solar when she returned to the lower bailey ser brynden tully stood on the water stairs with wet boots talking with the captain of riverruns guards he came to her at once is het dying she said as we feared her uncles craggy face showed his pain plain he ran his fingers through his thick grey hair will he see me she nodded he says he is too sick to fight page brynden blackfish chuckled i am too old a soldier to believe that hoster will be chiding me about the redwyne girl even as we light his funeral pyre damn his bones catelyn smiled knowing it was true i do not see robb he went with greyjoy to the hall i believe theon greyjoy was seated on a bench in riverruns great hall enjoying a horn of ale and regaling her fathers garrison with an account of the slaughter in the whispering wood some tried to flee but wed pinched the valley shut at both ends and we rode out of the darkness with sword and lance the lannisters must have thought the others themselves were on them when that wolf of robbs got in among them i saw him tear one mans arm from his shoulder and their horses went mad at the scent of him i couldnt tell you how many men were thrown theon she interrupted where might i find my son lord robb went to visit the godswood my lady it was what ned would have done he is his fathers son as much as mine i must remember oh gods ned she found robb beneath the green canopy of leaves surrounded by tall redwoods and great old elms kneeling before the heart tree a slender weirwood with a face more sad than fierce his longsword was before him the point thrust in the earth his gloved hands clasped around the hilt around him others knelt greatjon umber rickard karstark maege mormont galbart glover and more even tytos blackwood was among them the great raven cloak fanned out behind him these are the ones who keep the old gods she realized she asked herself what gods she kept these days and could not find an answer page it would not do to disturb them at their prayers the gods must have their due even cruel gods who would take ned from her and her lord father as well so catelyn waited the river wind moved through the high branches and she could see the wheel tower to her right ivy crawling up its side as she stood there all the memories came flooding back to her her father had taught her to ride amongst these trees and that was the elm that edmure had fallen from when he broke his arm and over there beneath that bower she and lysa had played at kissing with petyr she had not thought of that in years how young they all had beenshe no older than sansa lysa younger than arya and petyr younger still yet eager the girls had traded him between them serious and giggling by turns it came back to her so vividly she could almost feel his sweaty fingers on her shoulders and taste the mint on his breath there was always mint growing in the godswood and petyr had liked to chew it he had been such a bold little boy always in trouble he tried to put his tongue in my mouth catelyn had confessed to her sister afterward when they were alone he did with me too lysa had whispered shy and breathless i liked it robb got to his feet slowly and sheathed his sword and catelyn found herself wondering whether her son had ever kissed a girl in the godswood surely he must have she had seen jeyne poole giving him moisteyed glances and some of the serving girls even ones as old as eighteen he had ridden in battle and killed men with a sword surely he had been kissed there were tears in her eyes she wiped them away angrily mother robb said when he saw her standing there we must call a council there are things to be decided your grandfather would like to see you she said robb hes very sick ser edmure told me i am sorry mother for lord hoster and for you yet first we must meet weve had word from the south renly baratheon has claimed his brothers crown page renly she said shocked i had thought surely it would be lord stannis so did we all my lady galbart glover said the war council convened in the great hall at four long trestle tables arranged in a broken square lord hoster was too weak to attend asleep on his balcony dreaming of the sun on the rivers of his youth edmure sat in the high seat of the tullys with brynden blackfish at his side and his fathers bannermen arrayed to right and left and along the side tables word of the victory at riverrun had spread to the fugitive lords of the trident drawing them back karyl vance came in a lord now his father dead beneath the golden tooth ser marq piper was with him and they brought a darry ser raymuns son a lad no older than bran lord jonos bracken arrived from the ruins of stone hedge glowering and blustering and took a seat as far from tytos blackwood as the tables would permit the northern lords sat opposite with catelyn and robb facing her brother across the tables they were fewer the greatjon sat at robbs left hand and then theon greyjoy galbart glover and lady mormont were to the right of catelyn lord rickard karstark gaunt and holloweyed in his grief took his seat like a man in a nightmare his long beard uncombed and unwashed he had left two sons dead in the whispering wood and there was no word of the third his eldest who had led the karstark spears against tywin lannister on the green fork the arguing raged on late into the night each lord had a right to speak and speak they did and shout and curse and reason and cajole and jest and bargain and slam tankards on the table and threaten and walk out and return sullen or smiling catelyn sat and listened to it all roose bolton had reformed the battered remnants of their other host at the mouth of the causeway ser helman tallhart and walder frey still held the twins lord tywins army had crossed the trident and was making for harrenhal and there were two kings in the realm two kings and no agreement many of the lords bannermen wanted to march on harrenhal at once to meet lord tywin and end lannister power for all time young hottempered marq piper urged a strike west at casterly rock instead still others counseled patience riverrun sat athwart the lannister supply lines jason mallister pointed out let them bide their time denying lord tywin fresh levies and provisions while they page strengthened their defenses and rested their weary troops lord blackwood would have none of it they should finish the work they began in the whispering wood march to harrenhal and bring roose boltons army down as well what blackwood urged bracken opposed as ever lord jonos bracken rose to insist they ought pledge their fealty to king renly and move south to join their might to his renly is not the king robb said it was the first time her son had spoken like his father he knew how to listen you cannot mean to hold to joffrey my lord galbart glover said he put your father to death that makes him evil robb replied i do not know that it makes renly king joffrey is still roberts eldest trueborn son so the throne is rightfully his by all the laws of the realm were he to die and i mean to see that he does he has a younger brother tommen is next in line after joffrey tommen is no less a lannister ser marq piper snapped as you say said robb troubled yet if neither one is king still how could it be lord renly hes roberts younger brother bran cant be lord of winterfell before me and renly cant be king before lord stannis lady mormont agreed lord stannis has the better claim renly is crowned said marq piper highgarden and storms end support his claim and the dornishmen will not be laggardly if winterfell and riverrun add their strength to his he will have five of the seven great houses behind him six if the arryns bestir themselves six against the rock my lords within the year we will have all their heads on pikes the queen and the boy king lord tywin the imp the kingslayer ser kevan all of them that is what we shall win if we join with king renly what does lord stannis have against that that we should cast it all aside the right said robb stubbornly catelyn thought he sounded eerily like his father as he said it so you mean us to declare for stannis asked edmure page i dont know said robb i prayed to know what to do but the gods did not answer the lannisters killed my father for a traitor and we know that was a lie but if joffrey is the lawful king and we fight against him we will be traitors my lord father would urge caution aged ser stevron said with the weaselly smile of a frey wait let these two kings play their game of thrones when they are done fighting we can bend our knees to the victor or oppose him as we choose with renly arming likely lord tywin would welcome a truce and the safe return of his son noble lords allow me to go to him at harrenhal and arrange good terms and ransoms a roar of outrage drowned out his voice craven the greatjon thundered begging for a truce will make us seem weak declared lady mormont ransoms be damned we must not give up the kingslayer shouted rickard karstark why not a peace catelyn asked the lords looked at her but it was robbs eyes she felt his and his alone my lady they murdered my lord father your husband he said grimly he unsheathed his longsword and laid it on the table before him the bright steel on the rough wood this is the only peace i have for lannisters the greatjon bellowed his approval and other men added their voices shouting and drawing swords and pounding their fists on the table catelyn waited until they had quieted my lords she said then lord eddard was your liege but i shared his bed and bore his children do you think i love him any less than you her voice almost broke with her grief but catelyn took a long breath and steadied herself robb if that sword could bring him back i should never let you sheathe it until ned stood at my side once more but he is gone and hundred whispering woods will not change that ned is gone and daryn hornwood and lord karstarks valiant sons and many other good men besides and none of them will return to us must we have more deaths still you are a woman my lady the greatjon rumbled in his deep voice women do not understand these page things you are the gentle sex said lord karstark with the lines of grief fresh on his face a man has a need for vengeance give me cersei lannister lord karstark and you would see how gentle a woman can be catelyn replied perhaps i do not understand tactics and strategy but i understand futility we went to war when lannister armies were ravaging the riverlands and ned was a prisoner falsely accused of treason we fought to defend ourselves and to win my lords freedom well the one is done and the other forever beyond our reach i will mourn for ned until the end of my days but i must think of the living i want my daughters back and the queen holds them still if i must trade our four lannisters for their two starks i will call that a bargain and thank the gods i want you safe robb ruling at winterfell from your fathers seat i want you to live your life to kiss a girl and wed a woman and father a son i want to write an end to this i want to go home my lords and weep for my husband the hall was very quiet when catelyn finished speaking peace said her uncle brynden peace is sweet my lady but on what terms it is no good hammering your sword into a plowshare if you must forge it again on the morrow what did torrhen and my eddard die for if i am to return to karhold with nothing but their bones asked rickard karstark aye said lord bracken gregor clegane laid waste to my fields slaughtered my smallfolk and left stone hedge a smoking ruin am i now to bend the knee to the ones who sent him what have we fought for if we are to put all back as it was before lord blackwood agreed to catelyns surprise and dismay and if we do make peace with king joffrey are we not then traitors to king renly what if the stag should prevail against the lion where page would that leave us whatever you may decide for yourselves i shall never call a lannister my king declared marq piper nor p yelled the little darry boy i never will again the shouting began catelyn sat despairing she had come so close she thought they had almost listened almost but the moment was gone there would be no peace no chance to heal no safety she looked at her son watched him as he listened to the lords debate frowning troubled yet wedded to his war he had pledged himself to marry a daughter of walder frey but she saw his true bride plain before her now the sword he had laid on the table catelyn was thinking of her girls wondering if she would ever see them again when the greatjon lurched to his feet mylords he shouted his voice booming off the rafters here is what i say to these two kings he spat renly baratheon is nothing to me nor stannis neither why should they rule over me and mine from some flowery seat in highgarden or dorne what do they know of the wall or the wolfswood or the barrows of the first men even their gods are wrong the others take the lannisters too ive had a bellyful of them he reached back over his shoulder and drew his immense twohanded greatsword why shouldnt we rule ourselves again it was the dragons we married and the dragons are all dead he pointed at robb with the blade there sits the only king i mean to bow my knee to mlords he thundered the king in the north and he knelt and laid his sword at her sons feet ill have peace on those terms lord karstark said they can keep their red castle and their iron chair as well he eased his longsword from its scabbard the king in the north he said kneeling beside the greatjon page maege mormont stood the king of winter she declared and laid her spiked mace beside the swords and the river lords were rising too blackwood and bracken and mallister houses who had never been ruled from winterfell yet catelyn watched them rise and draw their blades bending their knees and shouting the old words that had not been heard in the realm for more than three hundred years since aegon the dragon had come to make the seven kingdoms one yet now were heard again ringing from the timbers of her fathers hall the king in the north the king in the north the king in the north dafnerys the land was red and dead and parched and good wood was hard to come by her foragers returned with gnarled cottonwoods purple brush sheaves of brown grass they took the two straightest trees hacked the limbs and branches from them skinned off their bark and split them laying the logs in a square its center they filled with straw brush bark shavings and bundles of dry grass rakharo chose a stallion from the small herd that remained to them he was not the equal of khal drogos red but few horses were in the center of the square aggo fed him a withered apple and dropped him in an instant with an axe blow between the eyes bound hand and foot mirri maz duur watched from the dust with disquiet in her black eyes it is not enough to kill a horse she told dany by itself the blood is nothing you do not have the words to make a spell nor the wisdom to find them do you think bloodmagic is a game for children you call me maegi as if it were a curse but all it means is wise you are a child with a childs ignorance whatever you mean to do it will not work loose me from these bonds and i will help you i am tired of the maegis braying dany told jhogo he took his whip to her and after that the godswife kept silent page over the carcass of the horse they built a platform of hewn logs trunks of smaller trees and limbs from the greater and the thickest i straightest branches they could find they laid the wood east to west from sunrise to sunset on the platform they piled khal drogos treasures his great tent his painted vests his saddles and harness the whip his father had given him when he came to manhood the arakh he had used to slay khal ogo and his son a mighty dragonbone bow aggo would have added the weapons drogos bloodriders had given dany for bride gifts as well but she forbade it those are mine she told him and i mean to keep them another layer of brush was piled about the khals treasures and bundles of dried grass scattered over them ser jorah mormont drew her aside as the sun was creeping toward its zenith princess he began why do you call me that dany challenged him my brother viserys was your king was he not he was my lady viserys is dead i am his heir the last blood of house targaryen whatever was his is mine now my queen ser jorah said going to one knee my sword that was his is yours dacnerys and my heart as well that never belonged to your brother i am only a knight and i have nothing to offer you but exile but i beg you hear me let khal drogo go you shall not be alone i promise you no man shall take you to vaes dothrak unless you wish to go you need not join the dosh khaleen come east with me yi ti oarth the jade sea asshai by the shadow we will see all the wonders yet unseen and drink what wines the gods see fit to serve us please khaleesi i know what you intend do not do not i must dany told him she touched his face fondly sadly you do not understand page a understand that you loved him ser jorah said in a voice thick with despair i loved my lady wife once yet i did not die with her you are my queen my sword is yours but do not ask me to stand aside as you climb on drogos pyre i will not watch you burn is that what you fear dany kissed him lightly on his broad forehead i am not such a child as that sweet ser you do not mean to die with him you swear it my queen a swear it she said in the common tongue of the seven kingdoms that by rights were hers the third level of the platform was woven of branches no thicker than a finger and covered with dry leaves and twigs they laid them north to south from ice to fire and piled them high with soft cushions and sleeping silks the sun had begun to lower toward the west by the time they were done dany called the dothraki around her fewer than a hundred were left how many had aegon started with she wondered it did not matter you will be my khalasar she told them i see the faces of slaves i free you take off your collars go if you wish no one shall harm you if you stay it will be as brothers and sisters husbands and wives the black eyes watched her wary expressionless i see the children women the wrinkled faces of the aged i was a child yesterday today i am a woman tomorrow i will be old to each of you i say give me your hands and your hearts and there will always be a place for you she turned to the three young warriors of her khas jhogo to you i give the silverhandled whip that was my bride gift and name you ko and ask your oath that you will live and die as blood of my blood riding at my side to keep me safe from harm jhogo took the whip from her hands but his face was confused khaleesi he said hesitantly this is not done it would shame me to be bloodrider to a woman page aggo dany called paying no heed to jhogos words if i look back i am lost to you i give the dragonbone bow that was my bride gift it was doublecurved shiny black and exquisite taller than she was i name you ko and ask your oath that you should live and die as blood of my blood riding at my side to keep me safe from harm aggo accepted the bow with lowered eyes i cannot say these words only a man can lead a khalasar or name a ko rakharo dany said turning away from the refusal you shall have the great arakh that was my bride gift with hilt and blade chased in gold and you too i name my ko and ask that you live and die as blood of my blood riding at my side to keep me safe from harm you are khaleesi rakharo said taking the arakh i shall ride at your side to vaes dothrak beneath the mother of mountains and keep you safe from harm until you take your place with the crones of the dosh khaleen no more can i promise she nodded as calmly as if she had not heard his answer and turned to the last of her champions ser jorah mormont she said first and greatest of my knights i have no bride gift to give you but i swear to you one day you shall have from my hands a longsword like none the world has ever seen dragonforged and made of valyrian steel and i would ask for your oath as well you have it my queen ser jorah said kneeling to lay his sword at her feet i vow to serve you to obey you to die for you if need be whatever may come whatever may come i shall hold you to that oath i pray you never regret the giving of it dany lifted him to his feet page stretching on her toes to reach his lips she kissed the knight gently and said you are the first of my queensguard she could feel the eyes of the khalasar on her as she entered her tent the dothraki were muttering and giving her strange sideways looks from the corners of their dark almond eyes they thought her mad dany realized perhaps she was she would know soon enough if i look back i am lost her bath was scalding hot when irri helped her into the tub but dany did not flinch or cry aloud she liked the heat it made her feel clean jhiqui had scented the water with the oils she had found in the market in vaes dothrak the steam rose moist and fragrant doreah washed her hair and combed it out working loose the mats and tangles irri scrubbed her back dany closed her eyes and let the smell and the warmth enfold her she could feel the heat soaking through the soreness between her thighs she shuddered when it entered her and her pain and stiffness seemed to dissolve she floated when she was clean her handmaids helped her from the water irri and jhiqui fanned her dry while doreah brushed her hair until it fell like a river of liquid silver down her back they scented her with spiceflower and cinnamon a touch on each wrist behind her ears on the tips of her milkheavy breasts the last dab was for her sex irris finger felt as light and cool as a lovers kiss as it slid softly up between her lips afterward dany sent them all away so she might prepare khal drogo for his final ride into the night lands she washed his body clean and brushed and oiled his hair running her fingers through it for the last time feeling the weight of it remembering the first time she had touched it the night of their wedding ride his hair had never been cut how many men could die with their hair uncut she buried her face in it and inhaled the dark fragrance of the oils he smelled like grass and warm earth like smoke and semen and horses he smelled like drogo forgive me sun of my life she thought forgive me for all i have done and all i must do i paid the price my star but it was too high too high dany braided his hair and slid the silver rings onto his mustache and hung his bells one by one so many bells gold and silver and bronze bells so his enemies would hear him coming and grow weak with fear she dressed him in horsehair leggings and high boots buckling a belt heavy with gold and silver medallions about his waist over his scarred chest she slipped a painted vest old and faded the one drogo had loved best for herself she chose loose sandsilk trousers sandals that laced halfway up her legs and a page vest like drogos the sun was going down when she called them back to carry his body to the pyre the dothraki watched in silence as jhogo and aggo bore him from the tent dany walked behind them they laid him down on his cushions and silks his head toward the mother of mountains far to the northeast oil she commanded and they brought forth the jars and poured them over the pyre soaking the silks and the brush and the bundles of dry grass until the oil trickled from beneath the logs and the air was rich with fragrance bring my eggs dany commanded her handmaids something in her voice made them run ser jorah took her arm my queen drogo will have no use for dragons eggs in the night lands better to sell them in asshai sell one and we can buy a ship to take us back to the free cities sell all three and you will be a wealthy woman all your days they were not given to me to sell dany told him she climbed the pyre herself to place the eggs around her sunandstars the black beside his heart under his arm the green beside his head his braid coiled around it the creamandgold down between his legs when she kissed him for the last time dany could taste the sweetness of the oil on his lips as she climbed down off the pyre she noticed mirri maz duur watching her you are mad the godswife said hoarsely is it so far from madness to wisdom dany asked ser jorah take this maegi and bind her to the pyre to the my queen no hear me do as i say still he hesitated until her anger flared you swore to obey me whatever might come rakharo help him page the godswife did not cry out as they dragged her to khal drogos pyre and staked her down amidst his treasures dany poured the oil over the womans head herself i thank you mirri maz duur she said for the lessons you have taught me you will not hear me scream mirri responded as the oil dripped from her hair and soaked her clothing i will dany said but it is not your screams i want only your life i remember what you told me only death can pay for life mirri maz duur opened her mouth but made no reply as she stepped away dany saw that the contempt was gone from the maegis flat black eyes in its place was something that might have been fear then there was nothing to be done but watch the sun and look for the first star when a horselord dies his horse is slain with him so he might ride a game of thronls proud into the night lands the bodies are burned beneath the open sky and the khal rises on his fiery steed to take his place among the stars the more fiercely the man burned in life the brighter his star will shine in the darkness jhogo spied it first there he said in a hushed voice dany looked and saw it low in the east the first star was a comet burning red bloodred fire red the dragons tail she could not have asked for a stronger sign dany took the torch from aggos hand and thrust it between the logs the oil took the fire at once the brush and dried grass a heartbeat later tiny flames went darting up the wood like swift red mice skating over the oil and leaping from bark to branch to leaf a rising heat puffed at her face soft and sudden as a lovers breath but in seconds it had grown too hot to bear dany stepped backward the wood crackled louder and louder mirri maz duur began to sing in a shrill ululating voice the flames whirled and writhed racing each other up the platform the dusk shimmered as the air itself seemed to liquefy from the heat dany heard logs spit and crack the fires swept over mirri maz duur her song grew louder shriller then she gasped again and again and her song became a shuddering wail thin and high and full of agony page and now the flames reached her drogo and now they were all around him his clothing took fire and for an instant the khal was clad in wisps of floating orange silk and tendrils of curling smoke grey and greasy danys lips parted and she found herself holding her breath part of her wanted to go to him as ser jorah had feared to rush into the flames to beg for his forgiveness and take him inside her one last time the fire melting the flesh from their bones until they were as one forever she could smell the odor of burning flesh no different than horseflesh roasting in a firepit the pyre roared in the deepening dusk like some great beast drowning out the fainter sound of mirri maz duurs screaming and sending up long tongues of flame to lick at the belly of the night as the smoke grew thicker the dothraki backed away coughing huge orange gouts of fire unfurled their banners in that hellish wind the logs hissing and cracking glowing cinders rising on the smoke to float away into the dark like so many newborn fireflies the heat beat at the air with great red wings driving the dothraki back driving off even mormont but dany stood her ground she was the blood of the dragon and the fire was in her she had sensed the truth of it long ago dany thought as she took a step closer to the conflagration but the brazier had not been hot enough the flames writhed before her like the women who had danced at her wedding whirling and singing and spinning their yellow and orange and crimson veils fearsome to behold yet lovely so lovely alive with heat dany opened her arms to them her skin flushed and glowing this is a wedding too she thought mirri maz duur had fallen silent the godswife thought her a child but children grow and children learn another step and dany could feel the heat of the sand on the soles of her feet even through her sandals sweat ran down her thighs and between her breasts and in rivulets over her cheeks where tears had once run ser jorah was shouting behind her but he did not matter anymore only the fire mattered the flames were so beautiful the loveliest things she had ever seen each one a sorcerer robed in yellow and orange and scarlet swirling long smoky cloaks she saw crimson firelions and great yellow serpents and unicorns made of pale blue flame she saw fish and foxes and monsters wolves and bright birds and flowering trees each more beautiful than the last she saw a horse a great grey stallion limned in smoke its flowing mane a nimbus of blue flame yes my love my sunandstars yes mount now tide now her vest had begun to smolder so dany shrugged it off and let it fall to the ground the painted leather burst into sudden flame as she skipped closer to the fire her breasts bare to the blaze streams of milk flowing from her red and swollen nipples now she thought now and for an instant she glimpsed khal drogo before her mounted on his smoky stallion a flaming lash in his hand he smiled and the whip page snaked down at the pyre hissing she heard a crack the sound of shattering stone the platform of wood and brush and grass began to shift and collapse in upon itself bits of burning wood slid down at her and dany was showered with ash and cinders and something else came crashing down bouncing and rolling to land at her feet a chunk of curved rock pale and veined with gold broken and smoking the roaring filled the world yet dimly through the firefall dany heard women shriek and children cry out in wonder only death can pay for life and there came a second crack loud and sharp as thunder and the smoke stirred and whirled around her and the pyre shifted the logs exploding as the fire touched their secret hearts she heard the screams of frightened horses and the voices of the dothraki raised in shouts of fear and terror and ser jorah calling her name and cursing no she wanted to shout to him no my good knight do not fearfor me the fire is mine i am daenerys stormborn daughter of dragons bride of dragons mother of dragons dont you see dont you see with a belch of flame and smoke that reached thirty feet into the sky the pyre collapsed and came down around her unafraid dany stepped forward into the firestorm calling to her children the third crack was as loud and sharp as the breaking of the world when the fire died at last and the ground became cool enough to walk upon ser jorah mormont found her amidst the ashes surrounded by blackened logs and bits of glowing ember and the burnt bones of man and woman and stallion she was naked covered with soot her clothes turned to ash her beautiful hair all crisped away yet she was unhurt the creamandgold dragon was suckling at her left breast the greenandbronze at the right her arms cradled them close the blackandscarlet beast was draped across her shoulders its long sinuous neck coiled under her chin when it saw jorah it raised its head and looked at him with eyes as red as coals page wordless the knight fell to his knees the men of her khas came up behind him jhogo was the first to lay his arakh at her feet blood of my blood he murmured pushing his face to the smoking earth blood of my blood she heard aggo echo blood of my blood rakharo shouted and after them came her handmaids and then the others all the dothraki men and women and children and dany had only to look at their eyes to know that they were hers now today and tomorrow and forever hers as they had never been drogos as daenerys targaryen rose to her feet her black hissed pale smoke venting from its mouth and nostrils the other two pulled away from her breasts and added their voices to the call translucent wings unfolding and stirring the air and for the first time in hundreds of years the night came alive with the music of dragons page a clash of kings book two of a song of ice and fire by george r r martin prologue the comets tail spread across the dawn a red slash that bled above the crags of dragonstone like a wound in the pink and purple sky the maester stood on the windswept balcony outside his chambers it was here the ravens came after long flight their droppings speckled the gargoyles that rose twelve feet tall on either side of him a hellhound and a wyvern two of the thousand that brooded over the walls of the ancient fortress when first he came to dragonstone the army of stone grotesques had made him uneasy but as the years passed he had grown used to them now he thought of them as old friends the three of them watched the sky together with foreboding the maester did not believe in omens and yet old as he was cressen had never seen a comet half so bright nor yet that color that terrible color the color of blood and flame and sunsets he wondered if his gargoyles had ever seen its like they had been here so much longer than he had and would still be here long after he was gone if stone tongues could speak such folly he leaned against the battlement the sea crashing beneath him the black stone rough beneath his fingers talking gargoyles and prophecies in the sky i am an old done man grown giddy as a child again had a lifetimes hardwon wisdom fled him along with his health and strength he was a maester trained and chained in the great citadel of oldtown what had he come to when superstition filled his head as if he were an ignorant fieldhand and yet and yet the comet burned even by day now while pale grey steam rose from the hot vents of dragonmont behind the castle and yestermorn a white raven had brought word from the citadel itself word longexpected but no less fearful for all that word of summers end omens all too many to deny what does it all mean he wanted to cry page maester cressen we have visitors pylos spoke softly as if loath to disturb cressens solemn meditations had he known what drivel filled his head he would have shouted the princess would see the white raven ever correct pylos called her princess now as her lord father was a king king of a smoking rock in the great salt sea yet a king nonetheless her fool is with her the old man turned away from the dawn keeping a hand on his wyvern to steady himself help me to my chair and show them in taking his arm pylos led him inside in his youth cressen had walked briskly but he was not far from his eightieth name day now and his legs were frail and unsteady two years past he had fallen and shattered a hip and it had never mended properly last year when he took ill the citadel had sent pylos out from oldtown mere days before lord stannis had closed the isle to help him in his labors it was said but cressen knew the truth pylos had come to replace him when he died he did not mind someone must take his place and sooner than he would like he let the younger man settle him behind his books and papers go bring her it is ill to keep a lady waiting he waved a hand a feeble gesture of haste from a man no longer capable of hastening his flesh was wrinkled and spotted the skin so papery thin that he could see the web of veins and the shape of bones beneath and how they trembled these hands of his that had once been so sure and deft when pylos returned the girl came with him shy as ever behind her shuffling and hopping in that queer sideways walk of his came her fool on his head was a mock helm fashioned from an old tin bucket with a rack of deer antlers strapped to the crown and hung with cowbells with his every lurching step the bells rang each with a different voice clangadang bongdong ringaling clong clong clong who comes to see us so early pylos cressen said its me and patches maester guileless blue eyes blinked at him hers was not a pretty face alas the child had her lord fathers square jut of jaw and her mothers unfortunate ears along with a disfigurement all her own the legacy of the bout of greyscale that had almost claimed her in the crib across half one cheek and well down her neck her flesh was stiff and dead the skin cracked and flaking mottled black and grey and stony to the touch pylos said we might see the white raven indeed you may cressen answered as if he would ever deny her she had been denied too often in her time her name was shireen she would be ten on her next name day and she was the saddest child that maester cressen had ever known her sadness is my shame the old man thought another mark of my failure maester pylos do me a kindness and bring the bird down from the rookery for the lady shireen it would be my pleasure pylos was a polite youth no more than fiveandtwenty yet solemn as a man of sixty if only he had more humor more life in him that was what was needed here grim places needed lightening not solemnity and dragonstone was grim beyond a doubt a lonely citadel in the wet waste surrounded by storm and salt with the smoking shadow of the mountain at its back a maester must go where he is sent so cressen had come here with his lord some twelve years past and he had served and served well yet he had never loved dragonstone nor ever felt truly at home here of late when he woke from restless dreams in which the red woman figured disturbingly he often did not know where he was page the fool turned his patched and piebald head to watch pylos climb the steep iron steps to the rookery his bells rang with the motion under the sea the birds have scales for feathers he said clangalanging i know i know oh oh oh even for a fool patchface was a sorry thing perhaps once he could evoke gales of laughter with a quip but the sea had taken that power from him along with half his wits and all his memory he was soft and obese subject to twitches and trembles incoherent as often as not the girl was the only one who laughed at him now the only one who cared if he lived or died an ugly little girl and a sad fool and maester makes three now there is a tale to make men weep sit with me child cressen beckoned her closer this is early to come calling scarce past dawn you should be snug in your bed i had bad dreams shireen told him about the dragons they were coming to eat me the child had been plagued by nightmares as far back as maester cressen could recall we have talked of this before he said gently the dragons cannot come to life they are carved of stone child in olden days our island was the westernmost outpost of the great freehold of valyria it was the valyrians who raised this citadel and they had ways of shaping stone since lost to us a castle must have towers wherever two walls meet at an angle for defense the valyrians fashioned these towers in the shape of dragons to make their fortress seem more fearsome just as they crowned their walls with a thousand gargoyles instead of simple crenellations he took her small pink hand in his own frail spotted one and gave it a gentle squeeze so you see there is nothing to fear shireen was unconvinced what about the thing in the sky dalla and matrice were talking by the well and dalla said she heard the red woman tell mother that it was dragonshreath if the dragons are breathing doesnt that mean they are coming to life the red woman maester cressen thought sourlyillenough that shes filled the head of the mother with her madness must she poison the daughters dreams as well he would have a stern word with dalla warn her not to spread such tales the thing in the sky is a comet sweet child a star with a tail lost in the heavens it will be gone soon enough never to be seen again in our lifetimes watch and see shireen gave a brave little nod mother said the white raven means its not summer anymore that is so my lady the white ravens fly only from the citadel cressens fingers went to the chain about his neck each link forged from a different metal each symbolizing his mastery of another branch of learning the maesters collar mark of his order in the pride of his youth he had worn it easily but now it seemed heavy to him the metal cold against his skin they are larger than other ravens and more clever bred to carry only the most important messages this one came to tell us that the conclave has met considered the reports and measurements made by maesters all over the realm and declared this great summer done at last ten years two turns and sixteen days it lasted the longest summer in living memory will it get cold now shireen was a summer child and had never known true cold in time cressen replied if the gods are good they will grant us a warm autumn and bountiful harvests so we might prepare for the winter to come the smallfolk said that a long summer meant an even longer winter but the maester saw no reason to frighten the child with such tales page patchface rang his bells it is always summer under the sea he intoned the merwives wear nennymoans in their hair and weave gowns of silver seaweed i know i know oh oh oh shireen giggled i should like a gown of silver seaweed under the sea it snows up said the fool and the rain is dry as bone i know i know oh oh oh will it truly snow the child asked it will cressen said but not for years yet i pray and then not for long ah here is pylos with the bird shireen gave a cry of delight even cressen had to admit the bird made an impressive sight white as snow and larger than any hawk with the bright black eyes that meant it was no mere albino but a truebred white raven of the citadel here he called the raven spread its wings leapt into the air and flapped noisily across the room to land on the table beside him ill see to your breakfast now pylos announced cressen nodded this is the lady shireen he told the raven the bird bobbed its pale head up and down as if it were bowing lady it croaked lady the childs mouth gaped open it talks a few words as i said they are clever these birds clever bird clever man clever clever fool said patchface jangling oh clever clever clever fool he began to sing the shadows come to dance my lord dance my lord dance my lord he sang hopping from one foot to the other and back again the shadows come to stay my lord stay my lord stay my lord he jerked his head with each word the bells in his antlers sending up a clangor the white raven screamed and went flapping away to perch on the iron railing of the rookery stairs shireen seemed to grow smaller he sings that all the time i told him to stop but he wont it makes me scared make him stop and how do i do that the old man wondered once i might have silenced him forever but now patchface had come to them as a boy lord steffon of cherished memory had found him in volantis across the narrow sea the kingthe old king aerys ii targaryen who had not been quite so mad in those dayshad sent his lordship to seek a bride for prince rhaegar who had no sisters to wed we have found the most splendid fool he wrote cressen a fortnight before he was to return home from his fruitless mission only a boy yet nimble as a monkey and witty as a dozen courtiers he juggles and riddles and does magic and he can sing prettily in four tongues we have bought his freedom and hope to bring him home with us robert will be delighted with him and perhaps in time he will even teach stannis how to laugh it saddened cressen to remember that letter no one had ever taught stannis how to laugh least of all the boy patchface the storm came up suddenly howling and shipbreaker bay proved the truth of its name the lords twomasted galley windproud broke up within sight of his castle from its parapets his two eldest sons had watched as their fathers ship was smashed against the rocks and swallowed by the waters a hundred oarsmen and sailors went down with lord steffon baratheon and his lady wife and for days thereafter every tide left a fresh crop of swollen corpses on the strand below storms end page the boy washed up on the third day maester cressen had come down with the rest to help put names to the dead when they found the fool he was naked his skin white and wrinkled and powdered with wet sand cressen had thought him another corpse but when jornmy grabbed his ankles to drag him off to the burial wagon the boy coughed water and sat up to his dying day jornmy had sworn that patchfaces flesh was clammy cold no one ever explained those two days the fool had been lost in the sea the fisherfolk liked to say a mermaid had taught him to breathe water in return for his seed patchface himself had said nothing the witty clever lad that lord steffon had written of never reached storms end the boy they found was someone else broken in body and mind hardly capable of speech much less of wit yet his fools face left no doubt of who he was it was the fashion in the free city of volantis to tattoo the faces of slaves and servants from neck to scalp the boys skin had been patterned in squares of red and green motley the wretch is mad and in pain and no use to anyone least of all himself declared old ser harbert the castellan of storms end in those years the kindest thing you could do for that one is fill his cup with the milk of the poppy a painless sleep and theres an end to it hed bless you if he had the wit for it but cressen had refused and in the end he had won whether patchface had gotten any joy of that victory he could not say not even today so many years later the shadows come to dance my lord dance my lord dance my lord the fool sang on swinging his head and making his bells clang and clatter bong dong ringaling bong dong lord the white raven shrieked lord lord lord a fool sings what he will the maester told his anxious princess you must not take his words to heart on the morrow he may remember another song and this one will never be heard again he can sing prettily in four tongues lord steffon had written pylos strode through the door maester pardons you have forgotten the porridge cressen said amused that was most unlike pylos maester ser davos returned last night they were talking of it in the kitchen i thought you would want to know at once davos last night you say where is he with the king they have been together most of the night there was a time when lord stannis would have woken him no matter the hour to have him there to give his counsel i should have been told cressen complained i should have been woken he disentangled his fingers from shireens pardons my lady but i must speak with your lord father pylos give me your arm there are too many steps in this castle and it seems to me they add a few every night just to vex me shireen and patchface followed them out but the child soon grew restless with the old mans creeping pace and dashed ahead the fool lurching after her with his cowbells clanging madly castles are not friendly places for the frail cressen was reminded as he descended the turnpike stairs of page sea dragon tower lord stannis would be found in the chamber of the painted table atop the stone drum dragonstones central keep so named for the way its ancient walls boomed and rumbled during storms to reach him they must cross the gallery pass through the middle and inner walls with their guardian gargoyles and black iron gates and ascend more steps than cressen cared to contemplate young men climbed steps two at a time for old men with bad hips every one was a torment but lord stannis would not think to come to him so the maester resigned himself to the ordeal he had pylos to help him at the least and for that he was grateful shuffling along the gallery they passed before a row of tall arched windows with commanding views of the outer bailey the curtain wall and the fishing village beyond in the yard archers were firing at practice butts to the call of notch draw loose their arrows made a sound like a flock of birds taking wing guardsmen strode the wallwalks peering between the gargoyles on the host camped without the morning air was hazy with the smoke of cookfires as three thousand men sat down to break their fasts beneath the banners of their lords past the sprawl of the camp the anchorage was crowded with ships no craft that had come within sight of dragonstone this past half year had been allowed to leave again lord stanniss fury a tripledecked war galley of three hundred oars looked almost small beside some of the bigbellied carracks and cogs that surrounded her the guardsmen outside the stone drum knew the maesters by sight and passed them through wait here cressen told pylos within its best i see him alone it is a long climb maester cressen smiled you think i have forgotten i have climbed these steps so often i know each one by name halfway up he regretted his decision he had stopped to catch his breath and ease the pain in his hip when he heard the scuff of boots on stone and came facetoface with ser davos seaworth descending davos was a slight man his low birth written plain upon a common face a wellworn green cloak stained by salt and spray and faded from the sun draped his thin shoulders over brown doublet and breeches that matched brown eyes and hair about his neck a pouch of worn leather hung from a thong his small beard was well peppered with grey and he wore a leather glove on his maimed left hand when he saw cressen he checked his descent ser davos the maester said when did you return in the black of morning my favorite time it was said that no one had ever handled a ship by night half so well as davos shorthand before lord stannis had knighted him he had been the most notorious and elusive smuggler in all the seven kingdoms and the man shook his head it is as you warned him they will not rise maester not for him they do not love him no cressen thought nor will they ever he is strong able just aye just past the point of wisdom yet it is not enough it has never been enough you spoke to them all page all no only those that would see me they do not love me either these highborns to them ill always be the onion knight his left hand closed stubby fingers locking into a fist stannis had hacked the ends off at the last joint all but the thumb i broke bread with gulian swann and old penrose and the tarths consented to a midnight meeting in a grove the otherswell beric dondarrion is gone missing some say dead and lord caron is with renly bryce the orange of the rainbow guard the rainbow guard renlys made his own kingsguard the onetime smuggler explained but these seven dont wear white each one has his own color loras tyrells their lord commander it was just the sort of notion that would appeal to renly baratheon a splendid new order of knighthood with gorgeous new raiment to proclaim it even as a boy renly had loved bright colors and rich fabrics and he had loved his games as well look at me he would shout as he ran laughing through the halls of storms end look at me im a dragon or look at me im a wizard or look at me look at me im the rain god the bold little boy with wild black hair and laughing eyes was a man grown now oneandtwenty and still he played his games look at me im a king cressen thought sadly oh renly renly dear sweet child do you know what you are doing and would you care if you did is there anyone who cares for him but me what reasons did the lords give for their refusals he asked ser davos well as to that some gave me soft words and some blunt some made excuses some promises some only lied he shrugged in the end words are just wind you could bring him no hope only the false sort and id not do that davos said he had the truth from me maester cressen remembered the day davos had been knighted after the siege of storms end lord stannis and a small garrison had held the castle for close to a year against the great host of the lords tyrell and redwyne even the sea was closed against them watched day and night by redwyne galleys flying the burgundy banners of the arbor within storms end the horses had long since been eaten the dogs and cats were gone and the garrison was down to roots and rats then came a night when the moon was new and black clouds hid the stars cloaked in that darkness davos the smuggler had dared the redwyne cordon and the rocks of shipbreaker bay alike his little ship had a black hull black sails black oars and a hold crammed with onions and salt fish little enough yet it had kept the garrison alive long enough for eddard stark to reach storms end and break the siege lord stannis had rewarded davos with choice lands on cape wrath a small keep and a knights honors but he had also decreed that he lose a joint of each finger on his left hand to pay for all his years of smuggling davos had submitted on the condition that stannis wield the knife himself he would accept no punishment from lesser hands the lord had used a butchers cleaver the better to cut clean and true afterward davos had chosen the name seaworth for his newmade house and he took for his banner a black ship on a pale grey fieldwith an onion on its sails the onetime smuggler was fond of saying that lord stannis had done him a boon by giving him four less fingernails to clean and trim no cressen thought a man like that would give no false hope nor soften a hard truth ser davos truth can be a bitter draught even for a man like lord stannis he thinks only of returning to kings landing in the fullness of his power to tear down his enemies and claim what is rightfully his yet now page if he takes this meager host to kings landing it will be only to die he does not have the numbers i told him as much but you know his pride davos held up his gloved hand my fingers will grow back before that man bends to sense the old man sighed you have done all you could now i must add my voice to yours wearily he resumed his climb lord stannis baratheons refuge was a great round room with walls of bare black stone and four tall narrow windows that looked out to the four points of the compass in the center of the chamber was the great table from which it took its name a massive slab of carved wood fashioned at the command of aegon targaryen in the days before the conquest the painted table was more than fifty feet long perhaps half that wide at its widest point but less than four feet across at its narrowest aegons carpenters had shaped it after the land of westeros sawing out each bay and peninsula until the table nowhere ran straight on its surface darkened by near three hundred years of varnish were painted the seven kingdoms as they had been in aegons day rivers and mountains castles and cities lakes and forests there was a single chair in the room carefully positioned in the precise place that dragonstone occupied off the coast of westeros and raised up to give a good view of the tabletop seated in the chair was a man in a tightlaced leather jerkin and breeches of roughspun brown wool when maester cressen entered he glanced up i knew you would come old man whether i summoned you or no there was no hint of warmth in his voice there seldom was stannis baratheon lord of dragonstone and by the grace of the gods rightful heir to the iron throne of the seven kingdoms of westeros was broad of shoulder and sinewy of limb with a tightness to his face and flesh that spoke of leather cured in the sun until it was as tough as steel hard was the word men used when they spoke of stannis and hard he was though he was not yet fiveandthirty only a fringe of thin black hair remained on his head circling behind his ears like the shadow of a crown his brother the late king robert had grown a beard in his final years maester cressen had never seen it but they said it was a wild thing thick and flerce as if in answer stannis kept his own whiskers cropped tight and short they lay like a blueblack shadow across his square jaw and the bony hollows of his cheeks his eyes were open wounds beneath his heavy brows a blue as dark as the sea by night his mouth would have given despair to even the drollest of fools it was a mouth made for frowns and scowls and sharply worded commands all thin pale lips and clenched muscles a mouth that had forgotten how to smile and had never known how to laugh sometimes when the world grew very still and silent of a night maester cressen fancied he could hear lord stannis grinding his teeth half a castle away once you would have woken me the old man said once you were young now you are old and sick and need your sleep stannis had never learned to soften his speech to dissemble or flatter he said what he thought and those that did not like it could be damned i knew youd learn what davos had to say soon enough you always do dont you i would be of no help to you if i did not cressen said i met davos on the stair and he told all i suppose i should have had the mans tongue shortened along with his fingers he would have made you a poor envoy then he made me a poor envoy in any case the storm lords will not rise for me it seems they do not like page me and the justice of my cause means nothing to them the cravenly ones will sit behind their walls waiting to see how the wind rises and who is likely to triumph the bold ones have already declared for renly for r enly he spat out the name like poison on his tongue your brother has been the lord of storms end these past thirteen years these lords are his sworn bannermen his stannis broke in when by rights they should be mine i never asked for dragonstone i never wanted it i took it because roberts enemies were here and he commanded me to root them out i built his fleet and did his work dutiful as a younger brother should be to an elder as renly should be to me and what was roberts thanks he names me lord of dragonstone and gives storms end and its incomes to renly storms end belonged to house baratheon for three hundred years by rights it should have passed to me when robert took the iron throne it was an old grievance deeply felt and never more so than now here was the heart of his lords weakness for dragonstone old and strong though it was commanded the allegiance of only a handful of lesser lords whose stony island holdings were too thinly peopled to yield up the men that stannis needed even with the sellswords he had brought across the narrow sea from the free cities of myr and lys the host camped outside his walls was far too small to bring down the power of house lannister robert did you an injustice maester cressen replied carefully yet he had sound reasons dragonstone had long been the seat of house targaryen he needed a mans strength to rule here and renly was but a child he is a child still stannis declared his anger ringing loud in the empty hall a thieving child who thinks to snatch the crown off my brow what has renly ever done to earn a throne he sits in council and jests with littlefinger and at tourneys he dons his splendid suit of armor and allows himself to be knocked off his horse by a better man that is the sum of my brother renly who thinks he ought to be a king i ask you why did the gods inflict me with brothers i cannot answer for the gods you seldom answer at all these days it seems to me who maesters for renly perchance i should send for him i might like his counsel better what do you think this maester said when my brother decided to steal my crown what counsel did your colleague offer to this traitor blood of mine it would surprise me if lord renly sought counsel your grace the youngest of lord steffons three sons had grown into a man bold but heedless who acted from impulse rather than calculation in that as in so much else renly was like his brother robert and utterly unlike stannis your grace stannis repeated bitterly you mock me with a kings style yet what am i king of dragonstone and a few rocks in the narrow sea there is my kingdom he descended the steps of his chair to stand before the table his shadow falling across the mouth of the blackwater rush and the painted forest where kings landing now stood there he stood brooding over the realm he sought to claim so near at hand and yet so far away tonight i am to sup with my lords bannermen such as they are celtigar velaryon bar emmon the whole paltry lot of them a poor crop if truth be told but they are what my brothers have left me that lysene pirate salladhor saan will be there with the latest tally of what i owe him and morosh the myrman will caution me with talk of tides and autumn gales while lord sunglass mutters piously of the will of the seven celtigar will want to know which storm lords are joining page us velaryon will threaten to take his levies home unless we strike at once what am i to tell them what must i do now your true enemies are the lannisters my lord maester cressen answered if you and your brother were to make common cause against them i will not treat with renly stannis answered in a tone that brooked no argument not while he calls himself a king not renly then the maester yielded his lord was stubborn and proud when he had set his mind there was no changing it others might serve your needs as well eddard starks son has been proclaimed king in the north with all the power of winterfell and riverrun behind him a green boy said stannis and another false king am i to accept a broken realm surely half a kingdom is better than none cressen said and if you help the boy avenge his fathers murder why should i avenge eddard stark the man was nothing to me oh robert loved him to be sure loved him as a brother how often did i hear that i was his brother not ned stark but you would never have known it by the way he treated me i held storms end for him watching good men starve while mace tyrell and paxter redwyne feasted within sight of my walls did robert thank me no he thanked stark for lifting the siege when we were down to rats and radishes i built a fleet at roberts command took dragonstone in his name did he take my hand and say well done brother whatever should i do without you no he blamed me for letting willem darry steal away viserys and the babe as if i could have stopped it i sat on his council for fifteen years helping jon arryn rule his realm while robert drank and whored but when jon died did my brother name me his hand no he went galloping off to his dear friend ned stark and offered him the honor and small good it did either of them be that as it may my lord maester cressen said gently great wrongs have been done you but the past is dust the future may yet be won if you join with the starks there are others you might sound out as well what of lady arryn if the queen murdered her husband surely she will want justice for him she has a young son jon arryns heir if you were to betroth shireen to him the boy is weak and sickly lord stannis objected even his father saw how it was when he asked me to foster him on dragonstone service as a page might have done him good but that damnable lannister woman had lord arryn poisoned before it could be done and now lysa hides him in the eyrie shell never part with the boy i promise you that then you must send shireen to the eyrie the maester urged dragonstone is a grim home for a child let her fool go with her so she will have a familiar face about her familiar and hideous stannis furrowed his brow in thought still perhaps it is worth the trying must the rightful lord of the seven kingdoms beg for help from widow women and usurpers a womans voice asked sharply maester cressen turned and bowed his head my lady he said chagrined that he had not heard her enter page lord stannis scowled i do not beg of anyone mind you remember that woman i am pleased to hear it my lord lady selyse was as tall as her husband thin of body and thin of face with prominent ears a sharp nose and the faintest hint of a mustache on her upper lip she plucked it daily and cursed it regularly yet it never failed to return her eyes were pale her mouth stern her voice a whip she cracked it now lady arryn owes you her allegiance as do the starks your brother renly and all the rest you are their one true king it would not be fitting to plead and bargain with them for what is rightfully yours by the grace of god god she said not gods the red woman had won her heart and soul turning her from the gods of the seven kingdoms both old and new to worship the one they called the lord of light your god can keep his grace said lord stannis who did not share his wifes fervent new faith its swords i need not blessings do you have an army hidden somewhere that youve not told me of there was no affection in his tone stannis had always been uncomfortable around women even his own wife when he had gone to kings landing to sit on roberts council he had left selyse on dragonstone with their daughter his letters had been few his visits fewer he did his duty in the marriage bed once or twice a year but took no joy in it and the sons he had once hoped for had never come my brothers and uncles and cousins have armies she told him house florent will rally to your banner house florent can field two thousand swords at best it was said that stannis knew the strength of every house in the seven kingdoms and you have a deal more faith in your brothers and uncles than i do my lady the florent lands lie too close to highgarden for your lord uncle to risk mace tyrells wrath there is another way lady selyse moved closer look out your windows my lord there is the sign you have waited for blazoned on the sky red it is the red of flame red for the fiery heart of the true god it is his bannerand yours see how it unfurls across the heavens like a dragons hot breath and you the lord of dragonstone it means your time has come your grace nothing is more certain you are meant to sail from this desolate rock as aegon the conqueror once sailed to sweep all before you as he did only say the word and embrace the power of the lord of light how many swords will the lord of light put into my hand stannis demanded again all you need his wife promised the swords of storms end and highgarden for a start and all their lords bannermen davos would tell you different stannis said those swords are sworn to renly they love my charming young brother as they once loved robert and as they have never loved me yes she answered but if renly should die stannis looked at his lady with narrowed eyes until cressen could not hold his tongue it is not to be thought your grace whatever follies renly has committed follies i call them treasons stannis turned back to his wife my brother is young and strong and he has a vast host around him and these rainbow knights of his page melisandre has gazed into the flames and seen him dead cressen was horrorstruck fratricide my lord this is evil unthinkable please listen to me lady selyse gave him a measured look and what will you tell him maester how he might win half a kingdom if he goes to the starks on his knees and sells our daughter to lysa arryn i have heard your counsel cressen lord stannis said now i will hear hers you are dismissed maester cressen bent a stiff knee he could feel lady selyses eyes on his back as he shuffled slowly across the room by the time he reached the bottom of the steps it was all he could do to stand erect help me he said to pylos when he was safe back in his own rooms cressen sent the younger man away and limped to his balcony once more to stand between his gargoyles and stare out to sea one of salladhor saans warships was sweeping past the castle her gaily striped hull slicing through the greygreen waters as her oars rose and fell he watched until she vanished behind a headland would that my fears could vanish so easily had he lived so long for this when a maester donned his collar he put aside the hope of children yet cressen had oft felt a father nonetheless robert stannis renly three sons he had raised after the angry sea claimed lord steffon had he done so ill that now he must watch one kill the other he could not allow it would not allow it the woman was the heart of it not the lady selyse the other one the red woman the servants had named her afraid to speak her name i will speak her name cressen told his stone hellhound melisandre her melisandre of asshai sorceress shadowbinder and priestess to rhllor the lord of light the heart of fire the god of flame and shadow melisandre whose madness must not be allowed to spread beyond dragonstone his chambers seemed dim and gloomy after the brightness of the morning with fumbling hands the old man lit a candle and carried it to the workroom beneath the rookery stair where his ointments potions and medicines stood neatly on their shelves on the bottom shelf behind a row of salves in squat clay jars he found a vial of indigo glass no larger than his little finger it rattled when he shook it cressen blew away a layer of dust and carried it back to his table collapsing into his chair he pulled the stopper and spilled out the vials contents a dozen crystals no larger than seeds rattled across the parchment hed been reading they shone like jewels in the candlelight so purple that the maester found himself thinking that he had never truly seen the color before the chain around his throat felt very heavy he touched one of the crystals lightly with the tip of his little finger such a small thing to hold the power of life and death it was made from a certain plant that grew only on the islands of the jade sea half a world away the leaves had to be aged and soaked in a wash of limes and sugar water and certain rare spices from the summer isles afterward they could be discarded but the potion must be thickened with ash and allowed to crystallize the process was slow and difficult the necessaries costly and hard to acquire the alchemists of lys knew the way of it though and the faceless men of braavos and the maesters of his order as well though it was not something talked about beyond the walls of the citadel all the world knew that a maester forged his silver link when he learned the art of healingbut the world preferred to forget that men who knew how to heal also knew how to kill page cressen no longer recalled the name the asshaii gave the leaf or the lysene poisoners the crystal in the citadel it was simply called the strangler dissolved in wine it would make the muscles of a mans throat clench tighter than any fist shutting off his windpipe they said a victims face turned as purple as the little crystal seed from which his death was grown but so too did a man choking on a morsel of food and this very night lord stannis would feast his bannermen his lady wife and the red woman melisandre of asshai i must rest maester cressen told himself i must have all my strength come dark my hands must not shake nor my courage flag it is a dreadful thing i do yet it must be done if there are gods surely they will forgive me he had slept so poorly of late a nap would refresh him for the ordeal ahead wearily he tottered off to his bed yet when he closed his eyes he could still see the light of the comet red and flery and vividly alive amidst the darkness of his dreams perhaps it is my comet he thought drowsily at the last just before sleep took him an omen of blood foretelling murder yes when he woke it was full dark his bedchamber was black and every joint in his body ached cressen pushed himself up his head throbbing clutching for his cane he rose unsteady to his feet so late he thought they did not summon me he was always summoned for feasts seated near the salt close to lord stannis his lords face swam up before him not the man he was but the boy he had been standing cold in the shadows while the sun shone on his elder brother whatever he did robert had done first and better poor boy he must hurry for his sake the maester found the crystals where he had left them and scooped them off the parchment cressen owned no hollow rings such as the poisoners of lys were said to favor but a myriad of pockets great and small were sewn inside the loose sleeves of his robe he secreted the strangler seeds in one of them threw open his door and called pylos where are you when he heard no reply he called again louder pylos i need help still there came no answer that was queer the young maester had his cell only a half turn down the stair within easy earshot in the end cressen had to shout for the servants make haste he told them i have slept too long they will be feasting by now drinking i should have been woken what had happened to maester pylos truly he did not understand again he had to cross the long gallery a night wind whispered through the great windows sharp with the smell of the sea torches flickered along the walls of dragonstone and in the camp beyond he could see hundreds of cookfires burning as if a field of stars had fallen to the earth above the comet blazed red and malevolent i am too old and wise to fear such things the maester told himself the doors to the great hall were set in the mouth of a stone dragon he told the servants to leave him outside it would be better to enter alone he must not appear feeble leaning heavily on his cane cressen climbed the last few steps and hobbled beneath the gateway teeth a pair of guardsmen opened the heavy red doors before him unleashing a sudden blast of noise and light cressen stepped down into the dragons maw over the clatter of knife and plate and the low mutter of table talk he heard patchface singing dance my lord dance my lord to the accompaniment of jangling cowbells the same dreadful song hed sung this morning the shadows come to stay my lord stay my lord stay my lord the lower tables were crowded with knights archers and sellsword captains tearing apart loaves of black bread to soak page in their fish stew here there was no loud laughter no raucous shouting such as marred the dignity of other mens feasts lord stannis did not permit such cressen made his way toward the raised platform where the lords sat with the king he had to step wide around patchface dancing his bells ringing the fool neither saw nor heard his approach as he hopped from one leg to the other patchface lurched into cressen knocking his cane out from under him they went crashing down together amidst the rushes in a tangle of arms and legs while a sudden gale of laughter went up around them no doubt it was a comical sight patchface sprawled half on top of him motley fools face pressed close to his own he had lost his tin helm with its antlers and bells under the sea you fall up he declared i know i know oh oh oh giggling the fool rolled off bounded to his feet and did a little dance trying to make the best of it the maester smiled feebly and struggled to rise but his hip was in such pain that for a moment he was half afraid that he had broken it all over again he felt strong hands grasp him under the arms and lift him back to his feet thank you ser he murmured turning to see which knight had come to his aid maester said lady melisandre her deep voice flavored with the music of the jade sea you ought take more care as ever she wore red head to heel a long loose gown of flowing silk as bright as fire with dagged sleeves and deep slashes in the bodice that showed glimpses of a darker bloodred fabric beneath around her throat was a red gold choker tighter than any maesters chain ornamented with a single great ruby her hair was not the orange or strawberry color of common redhaired men but a deep burnished copper that shone in the light of the torches even her eyes were red but her skin was smooth and white unblemished pale as cream slender she was graceful taller than most knights with full breasts and narrow waist and a heartshaped face mens eyes that once found her did not quickly look away not even a maesters eyes many called her beautiful she was not beautiful she was red and terrible and red i thank you my lady a man your age must look to where he steps melisandre said courteously the night is dark and full of terrors he knew the phrase some prayer of her faith it makes no matter i have a faith of my own only children fear the dark he told her yet even as he said the words he heard patchface take up his song again the shadows come to dance my lord dance my lord dance my lord now here is a riddle melisandre said a clever fool and a foolish wise man bending she picked up patchfaces helm from where it had fallen and set it on cressens head the cowbells rang softly as the tin bucket slid down over his ears a crown to match your chain lord maester she announced all around them men were laughing cressen pressed his lips together and fought to still his rage she thought he was feeble and helpless but she would learn otherwise before the night was done old he might be yet he was still a maester of the citadel i need no crown but truth he told her removing the fools helm from his head there are truths in this world that are not taught at oldtown melisandre turned from him in a swirl of red silk and made her way back to the high table where king stannis and his queen were seated page cressen handed the antlered tin bucket back to patchface and made to follow maester pylos sat in his place the old man could only stop and stare maester pylos he said at last you you did not wake me his grace commanded me to let you rest pylos had at least the grace to blush he told me you were not needed here cressen looked over the knights and captains and lords sitting silent lord celtigar aged and sour wore a mantle patterned with red crabs picked out in garnets handsome lord velaryon chose seagreen silk the white gold seahorse at his throat matching his long fair hair lord bar emmon that plump boy of fourteen was swathed in purple velvet trimmed with white seal ser axell florent remained homely even in russet and fox fur pious lord sunglass wore moonstones at throat and wrist and finger and the lysene captain salladhor saan was a sunburst of scarlet satin gold and jewels only ser davos dressed simply in brown doublet and green wool mantle and only ser davos met his gaze with pity in his eyes you are too ill and too confused to be of use to me old man it sounded so like lord stanniss voice but it could not be it could not pylos will counsel me henceforth already he works with the ravens since you can no longer climb to the rookery i will not have you kill yourself in my service maester cressen blinked stannis my lord my sad sullen boy son i never had you must not do this dont you know how i have cared for you lived for you loved you despite all yes loved you better than robert even or renly for you were the one unloved the one who needed me most yet all he said was as you command my lord but but i am hungry might not i have a place at your table at your side i belong at your side ser davos rose from the bench i should be honored if the maester would sit here beside me your grace as you will lord stannis turned away to say something to melisandre who had seated herself at his right hand in the place of high honor lady selyse was on his left flashing a smile as bright and brittle as her jewels too far cressen thought dully looking at where ser davos was seated half of the lords bannermen were between the smuggler and the high table i must be closer to her if i am to get the strangler into her cup yet how patchface was capering about as the maester made his slow way around the table to davos seaworth here we eat fish the fool declared happily waving a cod about like a scepter under the sea the fish eat us i know i know oh oh oh ser davos moved aside to make room on the bench we all should be in motley tonight he said gloomily as cressen seated himself for this is fools business were about the red woman has seen victory in her flames so stannis means to press his claim no matter what the numbers before shes done were all like to see what patchface saw i fearthe bottom of the sea cressen slid his hands up into his sleeves as if for warmth his fingers found the hard lumps the crystals made in the wool lord stannis page stannis turned from the red woman but it was lady selyse who replied king stannis you forget yourself maester he is old his mind wanders the king told her gruffly what is it cressen speak your mind as you intend to sail it is vital that you make common cause with lord stark and lady arryn i make common cause with no one stannis baratheon said no more than light makes common cause with darkness lady selyse took his hand stannis nodded the starks seek to steal half my kingdom even as the lannisters have stolen my throne and my own sweet brother the swords and service and strongholds that are mine by rights they are all usurpers and they are all my enemies i have lost him cressen thought despairing if only he could somehow approach melisandre unseen he needed but an instants access to her cup you are the rightful heir to your brother robert the true lord of the seven kingdoms and king of the andals the rhoynar and the first men he said desperately but even so you cannot hope to triumph without allies he has an ally lady selyse said whilor the lord of light the heart of fire the god of flame and shadow gods make uncertain allies at best the old man insisted and that one has no power here you think not the ruby at melisandres throat caught the light as she turned her head and for an instant it seemed to glow bright as the comet if you will speak such folly maester you ought to wear your crown again yes lady selyse agreed patchess helm it suits you well old man put it on again i command you under the sea no one wears hats patchface said i know i know oh oh oh lord stanniss eyes were shadowed beneath his heavy brow his mouth tight as his jaw worked silently he always ground his teeth when he was angry fool he growled at last my lady wife commands give cressen your helm no the old maester thought this is not you not your way you were always just always hard yet never cruel never you did not understand mockery no more than you understood laughter patchface danced closer his cowbells ringing clangalang dingding clinkclankclinkclank the maester sat silent while the fool set the antlered bucket on his brow cressen bowed his head beneath the weight his bells clanged perhaps he ought sing his counsel henceforth lady selyse said you go too far woman lord stannis said he is an old man and hes served me well and i will serve you to the last my sweet lord my poor lonely son cressen thought for suddenly he saw the way ser davoss cup was before him still halffull of sour red he found a hard flake of crystal in his sleeve held it tight between thumb and forefinger as he reached for the cup smooth motions deft i must not fumble now he prayed and page the gods were kind in the blink of an eye his fingers were empty his hands had not been so steady for years nor half so fluid davos saw but no one else he was certain cup in hand he rose to his feet mayhaps i have been a fool lady melisandre will you share a cup of wine with me a cup in honor of your god your lord of light a cup to toast his power the red woman studied him if you wish he could feel them all watching him davos clutched at him as he left the bench catching his sleeve with the fingers that lord stannis had shortened what are you doing he whispered a thing that must be done maester cressen answered for the sake of the realm and the soul of my lord he shook off davoss hand spilling a drop of wine on the rushes she met him beneath the high table with every mans eyes upon them but cressen saw only her red silk red eyes the ruby red at her throat red lips curled in a faint smile as she put her hand atop his own around the cup her skin felt hot feverish it is not too late to spill the wine maester no he whispered hoarsely no as you will melisandre of asshai took the cup from his hands and drank long and deep there was only half a swallow of wine remaining when she offered it back to him and now you his hands were shaking but he made himself be strong a maester of the citadel must not be afraid the wine was sour on his tongue he let the empty cup drop from his fingers to shatter on the floor he does have power here my lord the woman said and fire cleanses at her throat the ruby shimmered redly cressen tried to reply but his words caught in his throat his cough became a terrible thin whistle as he strained to suck in air iron fingers tightened round his neck as he sank to his knees still he shook his head denying her denying her power denying her magic denying her god and the cowbells peeled in his antlers singing fool fool fool while the red woman looked down on him in pity the candle flames dancing in her red red eyes chapter arya at winterfell they had called her arya horseface and shed thought nothing could be worse but that was before the orphan boy lommy greenhands had named her lumpyhead her head felt lumpy when she touched it when yoren had dragged her into that alley shed thought he meant to kill her but the sour old man had only held her tight sawing through her mats and tangles with his dagger she remembered how the breeze sent the fistfuls of dirty brown hair skittering across the paving stones toward the sept where her father had died im taking men and boys from the city yoren growled as the sharp steel scraped at her head now you hold still boy by the time he had finished her scalp was nothing but tufts and stubble page afterward he told her that from there to winterfell shed be arry the orphan boy gate shouldnt be hard but the roads another matter you got a long way to go in bad company i got thirty this time men and boys all bound for the wall and dont be thinking theyre like that bastard brother o yours he shook her lord eddard gave me pick o the dungeons and i didnt find no little lordlings down there this lot half o them would turn you over to the queen quick as spit for a pardon and maybe a few silvers the other halfd do the same only theyd rape you first so you keep to yourself and make your water in the woods alone thatll be the hardest part the pissing so dont drink no moren you need leaving kings landing was easy just like hed said the lannister guardsmen on the gate were stopping everyone but yoren called one by name and their wagons were waved through no one spared arya a glance they were looking for a highborn girl daughter of the kings hand not for a skinny boy with his hair chopped off arya never looked back she wished the rush would rise and wash the whole city away flea bottom and the red keep and the great sept and everything and everyone too especially prince joffrey and his mother but she knew it wouldnt and anyhow sansa was still in the city and would wash away too when she remembered that arya decided to wish for winterfell instead yoren was wrong about the pissing though that wasnt the hardest part at all lommy greenhands and hot pie were the hardest part orphan boys yoren had plucked some from the streets with promises of food for their bellies and shoes for their feet the rest hed found in chains the watch needs good men he told them as they set out but you lot will have to do yoren had taken grown men from the dungeons as well thieves and poachers and rapers and the like the worst were the three hed found in the black cells who must have scared even him because he kept them fettered hand and foot in the back of a wagon and vowed theyd stay in irons all the way to the wall one had no nose only the hole in his face where it had been cut off and the gross fat bald one with the pointed teeth and the weeping sores on his cheeks had eyes like nothing human they took five wagons out of kings landing laden with supplies for the wall hides and bolts of cloth bars of pig iron a cage of ravens books and paper and ink a bale of sourleaf jars of oil and chests of medicine and spices teams of plow horses pulled the wagons and yoren had bought two coursers and a halfdozen donkeys for the boys arya would have preferred a real horse but the donkey was better than riding on a wagon the men paid her no mind but she was not so lucky with the boys she was two years younger than the youngest orphan not to mention smaller and skinnier and lommy and hot pie took her silence to mean she was scared or stupid or deaf look at that sword lumpyheads got there lommy said one morning as they made their plodding way past orchards and wheat fields hed been a dyers apprentice before he was caught stealing and his arms were mottled green to the elbow when he laughed he brayed like the donkeys they were riding wheres a gutter rat like lumpyhead get him a sword arya chewed her lip sullenly she could see the back of yorens faded black cloak up ahead of the wagons but she was determined not to go crying to him for help maybe hes a little squire hot pie put in his mother had been a baker before she died and hed pushed her cart through the streets all day shouting hot pies hot pies some lordy lords little squire boy thats it page he aint no squire look at him i bet thats not even a real sword i bet its just some play sword made of tin arya hated them making fun of needle its castleforged steel you stupid she snapped turning in the saddle to glare at them and you better shut your mouth the orphan boys hooted whered you get a blade like that lumpyface hot pie wanted to know lumpyhead corrected lommy he probly stole it i did not she shouted jon snow had given her needle maybe she had to let them call her lumpyhead but she wasnt going to let them call jon a thief if he stole it we could take it off him said hot pie its not his anyhow i could use me a sword like that lommy egged him on go on take it off him i dare you hot pie kicked his donkey riding closer hey lumpyface you gimme that sword his hair was the color of straw his fat face all sunburnt and peeling you dont know how to use it yes i do arya could have said i killed a boy a fat boy like you i stabbed him in the belly and he died and ill kill you too if you dont let me alone only she did not dare yoren didnt know about the stableboy but she was afraid of what he might do if he found out arya was pretty sure that some of the other men were killers too the three in the manacles for sure but the queen wasnt looking for them so it wasnt the same look at him brayed lommy greenhands i bet hes going to cry now you want to cry lumpyhead she had cried in her sleep the night before dreaming of her father come morning shed woken redeyed and dry and could not have shed another tear if her life had hung on it hes going to wet his pants hot pie suggested leave him be said the boy with the shaggy black hair who rode behind them lommy had named him the bull on account of this horned helm he had that he polished all the time but never wore lommy didnt dare mock the bull he was older and big for his age with a broad chest and stronglooking arms you better give hot pie the sword arry lommy said hot pie wants it bad he kicked a boy to death hell do the same to you i bet i knocked him down and i kicked him in the balls and i kept kicking him there until he was dead hot pie boasted i kicked him all to pieces his balls were broke open and bloody and his cock turned black you better gimme the sword arya slid her practice sword from her belt you can have this one she told hot pie not wanting to fight thats just some stick he rode nearer and tried to reach over for needles hilt page arya made the stick whistle as she laid the wood across his donkeys hindquarters the animal hawed and bucked dumping hot pie on the ground she vaulted off her own donkey and poked him in the gut as he tried to get up and he sat back down with a grunt then she whacked him across the face and his nose made a crack like a branch breaking blood dribbled from his nostrils when hot pie began to wail arya whirled toward lommy greenhands who was sitting on his donkey openmouthed you want some sword too she yelled but he didnt he raised dyed green hands in front of his face and squealed at her to get away the bull shouted behind you and arya spun hot pie was on his knees his fist closing around a big jagged rock she let him throw it ducking her head as it sailed past then she flew at him he raised a hand and she hit it and then his cheek and then his knee he grabbed for her and she danced aside and bounced the wood off the back of his head he fell down and got up and stumbled after her his red face all smeared with dirt and blood arya slid into a water dancers stance and waited when he came close enough she lunged right between his legs so hard that if her wooden sword had had a point it would have come out between his butt cheeks by the time yoren pulled her off him hot pie was sprawled out on the ground with his breeches brown and smelly crying as arya whapped him over and over and over enough the black brother roared prying the stick sword from her fingers you want to kill the fool when lommy and some others started to squeal the old man turned on them too shut your mouths or ill be shutting them for you any more o this ill tie you lot behind the wagons and drag you to the wall he spat and that goes twice for you arry you come with me boy now they were all looking at her even the three chained and manacled in the back of the wagon the fat one snapped his pointy teeth together and hissed but arya ignored him the old man dragged her well off the road into a tangle of trees cursing and muttering all the while if i had a thimble o sense i wouldve left you in kings landing you hear me boy he always snarled that word putting a bite in it so she would be certain to hear unlace your breeches and pull em down go on theres no one here to see do it sullenly arya did as he said over there against the oak yes like that she wrapped her arms around the trunk and pressed her face to the rough wood you scream now you scream loud i wont arya thought stubbornly but when yoren laid the wood against the back of her bare thighs the shriek burst out of her anyway think that hurt he said try this one the stick came whistling arya shrieked again clutching the tree to keep from falling one more she held on tight chewing her lip flinching when she heard it coming the stroke made her jump and howl i wont cry she thought i wont do that im a stark of winterfell our sigil is the direwolf direwolves dont cry she could feel a thin trickle of blood running down her left leg her thighs and cheeks were ablaze with pain might be i got your attention now yoren said next time you take that stick to one of your brothers youll get twice what you give you hear me now cover yourself theyre not my brothers arya thought as she bent to yank up her breeches but she knew better than to say so her hands fumbled with her belt and laces yoren was looking at her you hurt calm as still water she told herself the way syrio forel had taught her some page he spat that pie boys hurting worse it wasnt him as killed your father girl nor that thieving lommy neither hitting them wont bring him back i know arya muttered sullenly heres something you dont know it wasnt supposed to happen like it did i was set to leave wagons bought and loaded and a man comes with a boy for me and a purse of coin and a message never mind who its from lord eddards to take the black he says to me wait hell be going with you why dyou think i was there only something went queer loffrey arya breathed someone should kill him someone will but it wont be me nor you neither yoren tossed back her stick sword got sourleaf back at the wagons he said as they made their way back to the road youll chew some itll help with the sting it did help some though the taste of it was foul and it made her spit look like blood even so she walked for the rest of that day and the day after and the day after that too raw to sit a donkey hot pie was worse off yoren had to shift some barrels around so he could lie in the back of a wagon on some sacks of barley and he whimpered every time the wheels hit a rock lommy greenhands wasnt even hurt yet he stayed as far away from arya as he could get every time you look at him he twitches the bull told her as she walked beside his donkey she did not answer it seemed safer not to talk to anyone that night she lay upon her thin blanket on the hard ground staring up at the great red comet the comet was splendid and scary all at once the red sword the bull named it he claimed it looked like a sword the blade still redhot from the forge when arya squinted the right way she could see the sword too only it wasnt a new sword it was ice her fathers greatsword all ripply valyrian steel and the red was lord eddards blood on the blade after ser ilyn the kings justice had cut off his head yoren had made her look away when it happened yet it seemed to her that the comet looked like ice must have after when at last she slept she dreamed of home the kingsroad wound its way past winterfell on its way to the wall and yoren had promised hed leave her there with no one any wiser about who shed been she yearned to see her mother again and robb and bran and rickon but it was jon snow she thought of most she wished somehow they could come to the wall before winterfell so jon might muss up her hair and call her little sister shed tell him i missed you and hed say it too at the very same moment the way they always used to say things together she would have liked that she would have liked that better than anything chapter sansa the morning of king joffreys name day dawned bright and windy with the long tail of the great comet visible through the high scuttling clouds sansa was watching it from her tower window when ser arys page oakheart arrived to escort her down to the tourney grounds what do you think it means she asked him glory to your betrothed ser arys answered at once see how it flames across the sky today on his graces name day as if the gods themselves had raised a banner in his honor the smallfolk have named it king joffreys comet doubtless that was what they told joffrey sansa was not so sure ive heard servants calling it the dragons tail king joffrey sits where aegon the dragon once sat in the castle built by his son ser arys said he is the dragons heirand crimson is the color of house lannister another sign this comet is sent to herald joffreys ascent to the throne i have no doubt it means that he will triumph over his enemies is it true she wondered would the gods be so cruel her mother was one of joffreys enemies now her brother robb another her father had died by the kings command must robb and her lady mother die next the comet was red but joffrey was baratheon as much as lannister and their sigil was a black stag on a golden field shouldnt the gods have sent joff a golden comet sansa closed the shutters and turned sharply away from the window you look very lovely today my lady ser arys said thank you ser knowing that joffrey would require her to attend the tourney in his honor sansa had taken special care with her face and clothes she wore a gown of pale purple silk and a moonstone hair net that had been a gift from joffrey the gown had long sleeves to hide the bruises on her arms those were joffreys gifts as well when they told him that robb had been proclaimed king in the north his rage had been a fearsome thing and he had sent ser boros to beat her shall we go ser arys offered his arm and she let him lead her from her chamber if she must have one of the kingsguard dogging her steps sansa preferred that it be him ser boros was shorttempered ser meryn cold and ser mandons strange dead eyes made her uneasy while ser preston treated her like a lackwit child arys oakheart was courteous and would talk to her cordially once he even objected when joffrey commanded him to hit her he did hit her in the end but not hard as ser meryn or ser boros might have and at least he had argued the others obeyed without question except for the hound but joff never asked the hound to punish her he used the other five for that ser arys had light brown hair and a face that was not unpleasant to look upon today he made quite the dashing figure with his white silk cloak fastened at the shoulder by a golden leaf and a spreading oak tree worked upon the breast of his tunic in shining gold thread who do you think will win the days honors sansa asked as they descended the steps arm in arm i will ser arys answered smiling yet i fear the triumph will have no savor this will be a small field and poor no more than two score will enter the lists including squires and freeriders there is small honor in unhorsing green boys the last tourney had been different sansa reflected king robert had staged it in her fathers honor high lords and fabled champions had come from all over the realm to compete and the whole city had turned out to watch she remembered the splendor of it the field of pavilions along the river with a knights shield hung before each door the long rows of silken pennants waving in the wind the gleam of sunlight on bright steel and gilded spurs the days had rung to the sounds of trumpets and pounding hooves and the nights had been full of feasts and song those had been the most magical days of her life page but they seemed a memory from another age now robert baratheon was dead and her father as well beheaded for a traitor on the steps of the great sept of baelor now there were three kings in the land and war raged beyond the trident while the city filled with desperate men small wonder that they had to hold joffs tournament behind the thick stone walls of the red keep will the queen attend do you think sansa always felt safer when cersei was there to restrain her son i fear not my lady the council is meeting some urgent business ser arys dropped his voice lord tywin has gone to ground at harrenhal instead of bringing his army to the city as the queen commanded her grace is furious he fell silent as a column of lannister guardsmen marched past in crimson cloaks and lioncrested helms ser arys was fond of gossip but only when he was certain that no one was listening the carpenters had erected a gallery and lists in the outer bailey it was a poor thing indeed and the meager throng that had gathered to watch filled but half the seats most of the spectators were guardsmen in the gold cloaks of the city watch or the crimson of house lannister of lords and ladies there were but a paltry few the handful that remained at court greyfaced lord gyles rosby was coughing into a square of pink silk lady tanda was bracketed by her daughters placid dull lollys and acidtongued falyse ebonskinned jalabhar xho was an exile who had no other refuge lady ermesande a babe seated on her wet nurses lap the talk was she would soon be wed to one of the queens cousins so the lannisters might claim her lands the king was shaded beneath a crimson canopy one leg thrown negligently over the carved wooden arm of his chair princess myrcella and prince tornmen sat behind him in the back of the royal box sandor clegane stood at guard his hands resting on his swordbelt the white cloak of the kingsguard was draped over his broad shoulders and fastened with a jeweled brooch the snowy cloth looking somehow unnatural against his brown roughspun tunic and studded leather jerkin lady sansa the hound announced curtly when he saw her his voice was as rough as the sound of a saw on wood the burn scars on his face and throat made one side of his mouth twitch when he spoke princess myrcella nodded a shy greeting at the sound of sansas name but plump little prince tommen jumped up eagerly sansa did you hear im to ride in the tourney today mother said i could tornmen was all of eight he reminded her of her own little brother bran they were of an age bran was back at winterfell a cripple yet safe sansa would have given anything to be with him i fear for the life of your foeman she told tornmen solemnly his foeman will be stuffed with straw joff said as he rose the king was clad in a gilded breastplate with a roaring lion engraved upon its chest as if he expected the war to engulf them at any moment he was thirteen today and tall for his age with the green eyes and golden hair of the lannisters your grace she said dipping in a curtsy ser arys bowed pray pardon me your grace i must equip myself for the lists joffrey waved a curt dismissal while he studied sansa from head to heels im pleased you wore my stones so the king had decided to play the gallant today sansa was relieved i thank you for them and for page your tender words i pray you a lucky name day your grace sit joff commanded gesturing her to the empty seat beside his own have you heard the beggar king is dead who for a moment sansa was afraid he meant robb viserys the last son of mad king aerys hes been going about the free cities since before i was born calling himself a king well mother says the dothraki finally crowned him with molten gold he laughed thats funny dont you think the dragon was their sigil its almost as good as if some wolf killed your traitor brother maybe ill feed him to wolves after ive caught him did i tell you i intend to challenge him to single combat i should like to see that your grace more than you know sansa kept her tone cool and polite yet even so joffreys eyes narrowed as he tried to decide whether she was mocking him will you enter the lists today she asked quickly the king frowned my lady mother said it was not fitting since the tourney is in my honor otherwise i would have been champion isnt that so dog the hounds mouth twitched against this lot why not he had been the champion in her fathers tourney sansa remembered will you joust today my lord she asked him cleganes voice was thick with contempt wouldnt be worth the bother of arming myself this is a tournament of gnats the king laughed my dog has a fierce bark perhaps i should command him to fight the days champion to the death joffrey was fond of making men fight to the death youd be one knight the poorer the hound had never taken a knights vows his brother was a knight and he hated his brother a blare of trumpets sounded the king settled back in his seat and took sansas hand once that would have set her heart to pounding but that was before he had answered her plea for mercy by presenting her with her fathers head his touch filled her with revulsion now but she knew better than to show it she made herself sit very still ser meryn trant of the kingsguard a herald called ser meryn entered from the west side of the yard clad in gleaming white plate chased with gold and mounted on a milkwhite charger with a flowing grey mane his cloak streamed behind him like a field of snow he carried a twelvefoot lance ser hobber of house redwyne of the arbor the herald sang ser hobber trotted in from the east riding a black stallion caparisoned in burgundy and blue his lance was striped in the same colors and his shield bore the grape cluster sigil of his house the redwyne twins were the queens unwilling guests even as sansa was she wondered whose notion it had been for them to ride in joffreys tourney not their own she thought page at a signal from the master of revels the combatants couched their lances and put their spurs to their mounts there were shouts from the watching guardsmen and the lords and ladies in the gallery the knights came together in the center of the yard with a great shock of wood and steel the white lance and the striped one exploded in splinters within a second of each other hobber redwyne reeled at the impact yet somehow managed to keep his seat wheeling their horses about at the far end of the lists the knights tossed down their broken lances and accepted replacements from the squires ser horas redwyne ser hobbers twin shouted encouragement to his brother but on their second pass ser meryn swung the point of his lance to strike ser hobber in the chest driving him from the saddle to crash resoundingly to the earth ser horas cursed and ran out to help his battered brother from the field poorly ridden declared king joffrey ser balon swann of stonehelm in the red watch came the heralds cry wide white wings ornamented ser balons greathelm and black and white swans fought on his shield morros of house slynt heir to lord janos of harrenhal look at that upiumped oaf joff hooted loud enough for half the yard to hear morros a mere squire and a newmade squire at that was having difficulty managing lance and shield the lance was a knights weapon sansa knew the slynts lowborn lord janos had been no more than commander of the city watch before joffrey had raised him to han renhal and the council i hope he falls and shames himself she thought bitterly i hope ser balon kills him when joffrey proclaimed her fathers death it had been janos slynt who seized lord eddards severed head by the hair and raised it on high for king and crowd to behold while sansa wept and screamed morros wore a checkered blackandgold cloak over black armor inlaid with golden scrollwork on his shield was the bloody spear his father had chosen as the sigil of their newmade house but he did not seem to know what to do with the shield as he urged his horse forward and ser balons point struck the blazon square morros dropped his lance fought for balance and lost one foot caught in a stirrup as he fell and the runaway charger dragged the youth to the end of the lists head bouncing against the ground joff hooted derision sansa was appalled wondering if the gods had heard her vengeful prayer but when they disentangled morros slynt from his horse they found him bloodied but alive tommen we picked the wrong foe for you the king told his brother the straw knight jousts better than that one next came ser horas redwynes turn he fared better than his twin vanquishing an elderly knight whose mount was bedecked with silver griffins against a striped blueandwhite field splendid as he looked the old man made a poor contest of it joffrey curled his lip this is a feeble show i warned you said the hound gnats the king was growing bored it made sansa anxious she lowered her eyes and resolved to keep quiet no matter what when joffrey baratheons mood darkened any chance word might set off one of his rages lothor brune freerider in the service of lord baelish cried the herald ser dontos the red of house hollard page the freerider a small man in dented plate without device duly appeared at the west end of the yard but of his opponent there was no sign finally a chestnut stallion trotted into view in a swirl of crimson and scarlet silks but ser dontos was not on it the knight appeared a moment later cursing and staggering clad in breastplate and plumed helm and nothing else his legs were pale and skinny and his manhood flopped about obscenely as he chased after his horse the watchers roared and shouted insults catching his horse by the bridle ser dontos tried to mount but the animal would not stand still and the knight was so drunk that his bare foot kept missing the stirrup by then the crowd was howling with laughter all but the king joffrey had a look in his eyes that sansa remembered well the same look hed had at the great sept of baelor the day he pronounced death on lord eddard stark finally ser dontos the red gave it up for a bad job sat down in the dirt and removed his plumed helm i lose he shouted fetch me some wine the king stood a cask from the cellars ill see him drowned in it sansa heard herself gasp no you cant joffrey turned his head what did you say sansa could not believe she had spoken was she mad to tell him no in front of half the court she hadnt meant to say anything only ser dontos was drunk and silly and useless but he meant no harm did you say i cant did you please sansa said i only meant it would be ill luck your grace to to kill a man on your name day youre lying joffrey said i ought to drown you with him if you care for him so much i dont care for him your grace the words tumbled out desperately drown him or have his head off only kill him on the morrow if you like but please not today not on your name day i couldnt bear for you to have ill luck terrible luck even for kings the singers all say so joffrey scowled he knew she was lying she could see it he would make her bleed for this the girl speaks truly the hound rasped what a man sows on his name day he reaps throughout the year his voice was flat as if he did not care a whit whether the king believed him or no could it be true sansa had not known it was just something shed said desperate to avoid punishment unhappy joffrey shifted in his seat and flicked his fingers at ser dontos take him away ill have him killed on the morrow the fool he is sansa said a fool youre so clever to see it hes better fitted to be a fool than a knight isnt he you ought to dress him in motley and make him clown for you he doesnt deserve the mercy of a quick death the king studied her a moment perhaps youre not so stupid as mother says he raised his voice did you hear my lady dontos from this day on youre my new fool you can sleep with moon boy and dress in motley page ser dontos sobered by his near brush with death crawled to his knees thank you your grace and you my lady thank you as a brace of lannister guardsmen led him off the master of revels approached the box your grace he said shall i summon a new challenger for brune or proceed with the next tilt neither these are gnats not knights id have them all put to death only its my name day the tourney is done get them all out of my sight the master of revels bowed but prince tommen was not so obedient im supposed to ride against the straw man not today but i want to ride i dont care what you want mother said i could ride she said princess myrcella agreed mother said mocked the king dont be childish were children myrcella declared haughtily were supposed to be childish the hound laughed she has you there joffrey was beaten very well even my brother couldnt tilt any worse than these others master bring out the quintain tommen wants to be a gnat tornmen gave a shout of joy and ran off to be readied his chubby little legs pumping hard luck sansa called to him they set up the quintain at the far end of the lists while the princes pony was being saddled tommens opponent was a childsized leather warrior stuffed with straw and mounted on a pivot with a shield in one hand and a padded mace in the other someone had fastened a pair of antlers to the knights head joffreys father king robert had worn antlers on his helm sansa remembered but so did his uncle lord renly roberts brother who had turned traitor and crowned himself king a pair of squires buckled the prince into his ornate silverandcrimson armor a tall plume of red feathers sprouted from the crest of his helm and the lion of lannister and crowned stag of baratheon frolicked together on his shield the squires helped him mount and ser aron santagar the red keeps masteratarms stepped forward and handed tornmen a blunted silver longsword with a leafshaped blade crafted to fit an eightyearold hand tornmen raised the blade high casterly rock he shouted in a high boyish voice as he put his heels into his pony and started across the hardpacked dirt at the quintain lady tanda and lord gyles started a ragged cheer and sansa added her voice to theirs the king brooded in silence page tornmen got his pony up to a brisk trot waved his sword vigorously and struck the knights shield a solid blow as he went by the quintain spun the padded mace flying around to give the prince a mighty whack in the back of his head tommen spilled from the saddle his new armor rattling like a bag of old pots as he hit the ground his sword went flying his pony cantered away across the bailey and a great gale of derision went up king joffrey laughed longest and loudest of all oh princess myrcella cried she scrambled out of the box and ran to her little brother sansa found herself possessed of a queer giddy courage you should go with her she told the king your brother might be hurt joffrey shrugged what if he is you should help him up and tell him how well he rode sansa could not seem to stop herself he got knocked off his horse and fell in the dirt the king pointed out thats not riding well look the hound interrupted the boy has courage hes going to try again they were helping prince tornmen mount his pony if only tommen were the elder instead of foffrey sansa thought i wouldnt mind marrying tommen the sounds from the gatehouse took them by surprise chains rattled as the portcullis was drawn upward and the great gates opened to the creak of iron hinges who told them to open the gate joff demanded with the troubles in the city the gates of the red keep had been closed for days a column of riders emerged from beneath the portcullis with a clink of steel and a clatter of hooves clegane stepped close to the king one hand on the hilt of his longsword the visitors were dinted and haggard and dusty yet the standard they carried was the lion of lannister golden on its crimson field a few wore the red cloaks and mail of lannister menatarms but more were freeriders and sellswords armored in oddments and bristling with sharp steel and there were others monstrous savages out of one of old nans tales the scary ones bran used to love they were clad in shabby skins and boiled leather with long hair and fierce beards some wore bloodstained bandages over their brows or wrapped around their hands and others were missing eyes ears and fingers in their midst riding on a tall red horse in a strange high saddle that cradled him back and front was the queens dwarf brother tyrion lannister the one they called the imp he had let his beard grow to cover his pushedin face until it was a bristly tangle of yellow and black hair coarse as wire down his back flowed a shadowskin cloak black fur striped with white he held the reins in his left hand and carried his right arm in a white silk sling but otherwise looked as grotesque as sansa remembered from when he had visited winterfell with his bulging brow and mismatched eyes he was still the ugliest man she had ever chanced to look upon yet tornmen put his spurs into his pony and galloped headlong across the yard shouting with glee one of the savages a huge shambling man so hairy that his face was all but lost beneath his whiskers scooped the boy out of his saddle armor and all and deposited him on the ground beside his uncle tommens breathless laughter echoed off the walls as tyrion clapped him on the backplate and sansa was startled to see that the two were of a height myrcella came running after her brother and the dwarf picked her up by the waist and spun her in a circle squealing when he lowered her back to the ground the little man kissed her lightly on the brow and came page waddling across the yard toward joffrey two of his men followed close behind him a blackhaired blackeyed sellsword who moved like a stalking cat and a gaunt youth with an empty socket where one eye should have been tornmen and myrcella trailed after them the dwarf went to one knee before the king your grace you joffrey said me the imp agreed although a more courteous greeting might be in order for an uncle and an elder they said you were dead the hound said the little man gave the big one a look one of his eyes was green one was black and both were cool i was speaking to the king not to his cur im glad youre not dead said princess myrcella we share that view sweet child tyrion turned to sansa my lady i am sorry for your losses truly the gods are cruel sansa could not think of a word to say to him how could he be sorry for her losses was he mocking her it wasnt the gods whod been cruel it was joffrey i am sorry for your loss as well joffrey the dwarf said what loss your royal father a large fierce man with a black beard youll recall him if you try he was king before you oh him yes it was very sad a boar killed him is that what they say your grace joffrey frowned sansa felt that she ought to say something what was it that septa mordane used to tell her a ladys armor is courtesy that was it she donned her armor and said im sorry my lady mother took you captive my lord a great many people are sorry for that tyrion replied and before i am done some may be a deal sorrier yet i thank you for the sentiment joffrey where might i find your mother shes with my council the king answered your brother jaime keeps losing battles he gave sansa an angry look as if it were her fault hes been taken by the starks and weve lost riverrun and now her stupid brother is calling himself a king the dwarf smiled crookedly all sorts of people are calling themselves kings these days joff did not know what to make of that though he looked suspicious and out of sorts yes well i am pleased youre not dead uncle did you bring me a gift for my name day page i did my wits id sooner have robb starks head joff said with a sly glance at sansa tommen myrcella come sandor clegane lingered behind a moment id guard that tongue of yours little man he warned before he strode off after his liege sansa was left with the dwarf and his monsters she tried to think of what else she might say you hurt your arm she managed at last one of your northmen hit me with a morningstar during the battle on the green fork i escaped him by falling off my horse his grin turned into something softer as he studied her face is it grief for your lord father that makes you so sad my father was a traitor sansa said at once and my brother and lady mother are traitors as well that reflex she had learned quickly i am loyal to my beloved joffrey no doubt as loyal as a deer surrounded by wolves lions she whispered without thinking she glanced about nervously but there was no one close enough to hear lannister reached out and took her hand and gave it a squeeze i am only a little lion child and i vow i shall not savage you bowing he said but now you must excuse me i have urgent business with queen and council sansa watched him walk off his body swaying heavily from side to side with every step like something from a grotesquerie he speaks more gently than foffrey she thought but the queen spoke to me gently too hes still a lannister her brother and foffs uncle and no friend once she had loved prince joffrey with all her heart and admired and trusted his mother the queen they had repaid that love and trust with her fathers head sansa would never make that mistake again chapter tyrion in the chilly white raiment of the kingsguard ser mandon moore looked like a corpse in a shroud her grace left orders the council in session is not to be disturbed i would be only a small disturbance ser tyrion slid the parchment from his sleeve i bear a letter from my father lord tywin lannister the hand of the king there is his seal her grace does not wish to be disturbed ser mandon repeated slowly as if tyrion were a dullard who had not heard him the first time jaime had once told him that moore was the most dangerous of the kingsguardexcepting himself page alwaysbecause his face gave no hint as what he might do next tyrion would have welcomed a hint bronn and timett could likely kill the knight if it came to swords but it would scarcely bode well if he began by slaying one of joffreys protectors yet if he let the man turn him away where was his authority he made himself smile ser mandon you have not met my companions this is timett son of timett a red hand of the burned men and this is bronn perchance you recall ser vardis egen who was captain of lord arryns household guard i know the man ser mandons eyes were pale grey oddly flat and lifeless knew bronn corrected with a thin smile ser mandon did not deign to show that he had heard that be that as it may tyrion said lightly i truly must see my sister and present my letter ser if you would be so kind as to open the door for us the white knight did not respond tyrion was almost at the point of trying to force his way past when ser mandon abruptly stood aside you may enter they may not a small victory he thought but sweet he had passed his first test tyrion lannister shouldered through the door feeling almost tall five members of the kings small council broke off their discussion suddenly you his sister cersei said in a tone that was equal parts disbelief and distaste i can see where joffrey learned his courtesies tyrion paused to admire the pair of valyrian sphinxes that guarded the door affecting an air of casual confidence cersei could smell weakness the way a dog smells f ear what are you doing here his sisters lovely green eyes studied him without the least hint of affection delivering a letter from our lord father he sauntered to the table and placed the tightly rolled parchment between them the eunuch varys took the letter and turned it in his delicate powdered hands how kind of lord tywin and his scaling wax is such a lovely shade of gold varys gave the seal a close inspection it gives every appearance of being genuine of course its genuine cersei snatched it out of his hands she broke the wax and unrolled the parchment tyrion watched her read his sister had taken the kings seat for herselfhe gathered joffrey did not often trouble to attend council meetings no more than robert hadso tyrion climbed up into the hands chair it seemed only appropriate this is absurd the queen said at last my lord father has sent my brother to sit in his place in this council he bids us accept tyrion as the hand of the king until such time as he himself can join us grand maester pycelle stroked his flowing white beard and nodded ponderously it would seem that a welcome is in order indeed jowly balding janos slynt looked rather like a frog a smug frog who had gotten rather above page himself we have sore need of you my lord rebellion everywhere this grim omen in the sky rioting in the city streets and whose fault is that lord janos cersei lashed out your gold cloaks are charged with keeping order as to you tyrion you could better serve us on the field of battle he laughed no im done with fields of battle thank you i sit a chair better than a horse and id sooner hold a wine goblet than a battleaxe all that about the thunder of the drums sunlight flashing on armor magnificent destriers snorting and prancing well the drums gave me headaches the sunlight flashing on my armor cooked me up like a harvest day goose and those magnificent destriers shit everywhere not that i am complaining compared to the hospitality i enjoyed in the vale of arryn drums horseshit and fly bites are my favorite things littlefinger laughed well said lannister a man after my own heart tyrion smiled at him remembering a certain dagger with a dragonbone hilt and a valyrian steel blade we must have a talk about that and soon he wondered if lord petyr would find that subject amusing as well please he told them do let me be of service in whatever small way i can cersei read the letter again how many men have you brought with you a few hundred my own men chiefly father was loath to part with any of his he is fighting a war after all what use will your few hundred men be if renly marches on the city or stannis sails from dragonstone i ask for an army and my father sends me a dwarf the king names the hand with the consent of council joffrey named our lord father and our lord father named me he cannot do that not without joffs consent lord tywin is at harrenhal with his host if youd care to take it up with him tyrion said politely my lords perchance you would permit me a private word with my sister varys slithered to his feet smiling in that unctuous way he had how you must have yearned for the sound of your sweet sisters voice my lords please let us give them a few moments together the woes of our troubled realm shall keep janos slynt rose hesitantly and grand maester pycelle ponderously yet they rose littlefinger was the last shall i tell the steward to prepare chambers in maegors holdfast my thanks lord petyr but i will be taking lord starks former quarters in the tower of the hand littlefinger laughed youre a braver man than me lannister you do know the fate of our last two hands two if you mean to frighten me why not say four page four littlefinger raised an eyebrow did the hands before lord arryn meet some dire end in the tower im afraid i was too young to pay them much mind aerys targaryens last hand was killed during the sack of kings landing though i doubt hed had time to settle into the tower he was only hand for a fortnight the one before him was burned to death and before them came two others who died landless and penniless in exile and counted themselves lucky i believe my lord father was the last hand to depart kings landing with his name properties and parts all intact fascinating said littlefinger and all the more reason id sooner bed down in the dungeon perhaps youll get that wish tyrion thought but he said courage and folly are cousins or so ive heard whatever curse may linger over the tower of the hand i pray im small enough to escape its notice janos slynt laughed littlefinger smiled and grand maester pycelle followed them both out bowing gravely i hope father did not send you all this way to plague us with history lessons his sister said when they were alone how i have yearned for the sound of your sweet voice tyrion sighed to her how i have yearned to have that eunuchs tongue pulled out with hot pincers cersei replied has father lost his senses or did you forge this letter she read it once more with mounting annoyance why would he inflict you on me i wanted him to come himself she crushed lord tywins letter in her fingers i am joffreys regent and i sent him a royal command and he ignored you tyrion pointed out he has quite a large army he can do that nor is he the first is he cerseis mouth tightened he could see her color rising if i name this letter a forgery and tell them to throw you in a dungeon no one will ignore that i promise you he was walking on rotten ice now tyrion knew one false step and he would plunge through no one he agreed amiably least of all our father the one with the army but why should you want to throw me into a dungeon sweet sister when ive come all this long way to help you i do not require your help it was our fathers presence that i commanded yes he said quietly but its jaime you want his sister fancied herself subtle but he had grown up with her he could read her face like one of his favorite books and what he read now was rage and fear and despair jaime is my brother no less than yours tyrion interrupted give me your support and i promise you we will have jaime freed and returned to us unharmed how cersei demanded the stark boy and his mother are not like to forget that we beheaded lord page eddard true tyrion agreed yet you still hold his daughters dont you i saw the older girl out in the yard with joffrey sansa the queen said ive given it out that i have the younger brat as well but its a lie i sent meryn trant to take her in hand when robert died but her wretched dancing master interfered and the girl fled no one has seen her since likely shes dead a great many people died that day tyrion had hoped for both stark girls but he supposed one would have to do tell me about our friends on the council his sister glanced at the door what of them father seems to have taken a dislike to them when i left him he was wondering how their heads might look on the wall beside lord starks he leaned forward across the table are you certain of their loyalty do you trust them i trust no one cersei snapped i need them does father believe they are playing us false suspects rather why what does he know tyrion shrugged he knows that your sons short reign has been a long parade of follies and disasters that suggests that someone is giving joffrey some very bad counsel cersei gave him a searching look joff has had no lack of good counsel hes always been strongwilled now that hes king he believes he should do as he pleases not as hes bid crowns do queer things to the heads beneath them tyrion agreed this business with eddard stark joffreys work the queen grimaced he was instructed to pardon stark to allow him to take the black the man would have been out of our way forever and we might have made peace with that son of his but joff took it upon himself to give the mob a better show what was i to do he called for lord eddards head in front of half the city and janos slynt and ser ilyn went ahead blithely and shortened the man without a word from me her hand tightened into a fist the high septon claims we profaned baelors sept with blood after lying to him about our intent it would seem he has a point said tyrion so this lord slynt he was part of it was he tell me whose fine notion was it to grant him harrenhal and name him to the council littlefinger made the arrangements we needed slynts gold cloaks eddard stark was plotting with renly and hed written to lord stannis offering him the throne we might have lost all even so it was a close thing if sansa hadnt come to me and told me all her fathers plans tyrion was surprised truly his own daughter sansa had always seemed such a sweet child tender and courteous the girl was wet with love she would have done anything for joffrey until he cut off her fathers head page and called it mercy that put an end to that his grace has a unique way of winning the hearts of his subjects tyrion said with a crooked smile was it joffreys wish to dismiss ser barristan selmy from his kingsguard too cersei sighed joff wanted someone to blame for roberts death varys suggested ser barristan why not it gave jaime command of the kingsguard and a seat on the small council and allowed joff to throw a bone to his dog he is very fond of sandor clegane we were prepared to offer selmy some land and a towerhouse more than the useless old fool deserved i hear that useless old fool slew two of slynts gold cloaks when they tried to seize him at the mud gate his sister looked very unhappy janos should have sent more men he is not as competent as might be wished ser barristan was the lord commander of robert baratheons kingsguard tyrion reminded her pointedly he and jaime are the only survivors of aerys targaryens seven the smallfolk talk of him in the same way they talk of serwyn of the mirror shield and prince aemon the dragonknight what do you imagine theyll think when they see barristan the bold riding beside robb stark or stannis baratheon cersei glanced away i had not considered that father did said tyrion that is why he sent me to put an end to these follies and bring your son to heel joff will be no more tractable for you than for me he might why should he he knows you would never hurt him cerseis eyes narrowed if you believe id ever allow you to harm my son youre sick with fever tyrion sighed shed missed the point as she did so often joffrey is as safe with me as he is with you he assured her but so long as the boy feels threatened hell be more inclined to listen he took her hand i am your brother you know you need me whether you care to admit it or no your son needs me if hes to have a hope of retaining that ugly iron chair his sister seemed shocked that he would touch her you have always been cunning in my own small way he grinned it may be worth the trying but make no mistake tyrion if i accept you you shall be the kings hand in name but my hand in truth you will share all your plans and intentions with me before you act and you will do nothing without my consent do you understand page oh yes do you agree certainly he lied i am yours sister for as long as i need to be so now that we are of one purpose we ought have no more secrets between us you say joffrey had lord eddard killed varys dismissed ser barristan and littlefinger gifted us with lord slynt who murdered jon arryn cersei yanked her hand back how should i know the grieving widow in the eyrie seems to think it was me where did she come by that notion i wonder im sure i dont know that fool eddard stark accused me of the same thing he hinted that lord arryn suspected or well believed that you were fucking our sweet jaime she slapped him did you think i was as blind as father tyrion rubbed his cheek who you lie with is no matter to me although it doesnt seem quite just that you should open your legs for one brother and not the other she slapped him be gentle cersei im only jesting with you if truth be told id sooner have a nice whore i never understood what jaime saw in you apart from his own reflection she slapped him his cheeks were red and burning yet he smiled if you keep doing that i may get angry that stayed her hand why should i care if you do i have some new friends tyrion confessed you wont like them at all how did you kill robert he did that himself all we did was help when lancel saw that robert was going after boar he gave him strongwine his favorite sour red but fortified three times as potent as he was used to the great stinking fool loved it he could have stopped swilling it down anytime he cared to but no he drained one skin and told lancel to fetch another the boar did the rest you should have been at the feast tyrion there has never been a boar so delicious they cooked it with mushrooms and apples and it tasted like triumph truly sister you were born to be a widow tyrion had rather liked robert baratheon great blustering oaf that he was doubtless in part because his sister loathed him so now if you are done slapping me i will be off he twisted his legs around and clambered down awkwardly from the chair cersei frowned i havent given you leave to depart i want to know how you intend to free jaime ill tell you when i know schemes are like fruit they require a certain ripening right now i have a page mind to ride through the streets and take the measure of this city tyrion rested his hand on the head of the sphinx beside the door one parting request kindly make certain no harm comes to sansa stark it would not do to lose both the daughters outside the council chamber tyrion nodded to ser mandon and made his way down the long vaulted hall bronn fell in beside him of timett son of timett there was no sign wheres our red hand tyrion asked he felt an urge to explore his kind was not made for waiting about in halls i hope he doesnt kill anyone important the clansmen tyrion had brought down from their fastnesses in the mountains of the moon were loyal in their own fierce way but they were proud and quarrelsome as well prone to answer insults real or imagined with steel try to find him and while you are at it see that the rest have been quartered and fed i want them in the barracks beneath the tower of the hand but dont let the steward put the stone crows near the moon brothers and tell him the burned men must have a hall all to themselves where will you be im riding back to the broken anvil bronn grinned insolently need an escort the talk is the streets are dangerous ill call upon the captain of my sisters household guard and remind him that i am no less a lannister than she is he needs to recall that his oath is to casterly rock not to cersei or joffrey an hour later tyrion rode from the red keep accompanied by a dozen lannister guardsmen in crimson cloaks and lioncrested halffielms as they passed beneath the portcullis he noted the heads mounted atop the walls black with rot and old tar they had long since become unrecognizable captain vylarr he called i want those taken down on the morrow give them to the silent sisters for cleaning it would be hell to match them with the bodies he supposed yet it must be done even in the midst of war certain decencies needed to be observed vylarr grew hesitant his grace has told us he wishes the traitors heads to remain on the walls until he fills those last three empty spikes there on the end let me hazard a wild stab one is for robb stark the others for lords stannis and renly would that be right yes my lord my nephew is thirteen years old today vylarr try and recall that ill have the heads down on the morrow or one of those empty spikes may have a different lodger do you take my meaning captain ill see that theyre taken down myself my lord good tyrion put his heels into his horse and trotted away leaving the red cloaks to follow as best they could page he had told cersei he intended to take the measure of the city that was not entirely a lie tyrion lannister was not pleased by much of what he saw the streets of kings landing had always been teeming and raucous and noisy but now they reeked of danger in a way that he did not recall from past visits a naked corpse sprawled in the gutter near the street of looms being torn at by a pack of feral dogs yet no one seemed to care watchmen were much in evidence moving in pairs through the alleys in their gold cloaks and shirts of black ringmail iron cudgels never far from their hands the markets were crowded with ragged men selling their household goods for any price they could get and conspicuously empty of farmers selling food what little produce he did see was three times as costly as it had been a year ago one peddler was hawking rats roasted on a skewer fresh rats he cried loudly fresh rats doubtless fresh rats were to be preferred to old stale rotten rats the frightening thing was the rats looked more appetizing than most of what the butchers were selling on the street of flour tyrion saw guards at every other shop door when times grew lean even bakers found sellswords cheaper than bread he reflected there is no food coming in is there he said to vylarr little enough the captain admitted with the war in the riverlands and lord renly raising rebels in highgarden the roads are closed to south and west and what has my good sister done about this she is taking steps to restore the kings peace vylarr assured him lord slynt has tripled the size of the city watch and the queen has put a thousand craftsmen to work on our defenses the stonemasons are strengthening the walls carpenters are building scorpions and catapults by the hundred fletchers are making arrows the smiths are forging blades and the alchemists guild has pledged ten thousand jars of wildfire tyrion shifted uncomfortably in his saddle he was pleased that cersei had not been idle but wildfire was treacherous stuff and ten thousand jars were enough to turn all of kings landing into cinders where has my sister found the coin to pay for all of this it was no secret that king robert had left the crown vastly in debt and alchemists were seldom mistaken for altruists lord littlefinger always finds a way my lord he has imposed a tax on those wishing to enter the city yes that would work tyrion said thinking clever clever and cruel tens of thousands had fled the fighting for the supposed safety of kings landing he had seen them on the kingsroad troupes of mothers and children and anxious fathers who had gazed on his horses and wagons with covetous eyes once they reached the city they would doubtless pay over all they had to put those high comforting walls between them and the war though they might think twice if they knew about the wildfire the inn beneath the sign of the broken anvil stood within sight of those walls near the gate of the gods where they had entered that morning as they rode into its courtyard a boy ran out to help tyrion down from his horse take your men back to the castle he told vylarr ill be spending the night here the captain looked dubious will you be safe my lord well as to that captain when i left the inn this morning it was full of black ears one is never quite safe when chella daughter of cheyk is about tyrion waddled toward the door leaving vylarr to puzzle at his meaning a gust of merriment greeted him as he shoved into the inns common room he recognized chellas page throaty chuckle and the lighter music of shaes laughter the girl was seated by the hearth sipping wine at a round wooden table with three of the black ears hed left to guard her and a plump man whose back was to him the innkeeper he assumed until shae called tyrion by name and the intruder rose my good lord i am so pleased to see you he gushed a soft eunuchs smile on his powdered face tyrion stumbled lord varys i had not thought to see you here the others take him how did he find them so quickly forgive me if i intrude varys said i was taken by a sudden urge to meet your young lady young lady shae repeated savoring the words youre half right mlord im young eighteen tyrion thought eighteen and a whore but quick of wit nimble as a cat between the sheets with large dark eyes and fine black hair and a sweet soft hungry little mouth and mine damn you eunuch i fear im the intruder lord varys he said with forced courtesy when i came in you were in the midst of some merriment mlord varys complimented chella on her ears and said she must have killed many men to have such a fine necklace shae explained it grated on him to hear her call varys mlord in that tone that was what she called him in their pillow play and chella told him only cowards kill the vanquished braver to leave the man alive with a chance to cleanse his shame by winning back his ear explained chella a small dark woman whose grisly neckware was hung with no less than fortysix dried wrinkled ears tyrion had counted them once only so can you prove you do not fear your enemies shae hooted and then mlord says if he was a black ear hed never sleep for dreams of oneeared men a problem i will never need face tyrion said im terrified of my enemies so i kill them all varys giggled will you take some wine with us my lord ill take some wine tyrion seated himself beside shae he understood what was happening here if chella and the girl did not varys was delivering a message when he said i was taken by a sudden urge to meet your young lady what he meant was you tried to hide her but i knew where she was and who she was and here i am he wondered who had betrayed him the innkeeper that boy in the stable a guard on the gate or one of his own i always like to return to the city through the gate of the gods varys told shae as he filled the wine cups the carvings on the gatehouse are exquisite they make me weep each time i see them the eyes so expressive dont you think they almost seem to follow you as you ride beneath the portcullis i never noticed mlord shae replied ill look again on the morrow if it please you dont bother sweetling tyrion thought swirling the wine in the cup he cares not a whit about carvings the eyes he boasts of are his own what he means is that he was watching that he knew we were here the moment we passed through the gates do be careful child varys urged kings landing is not wholly safe these days i know these streets page well and yet i almost feared to come today alone and unarmed as i was lawless men are everywhere in this dark time oh yes men with cold steel and colder hearts where i can come alone and unarmed others can come with swords in their fists he was saying shae only laughed if they try and bother me theyll be one ear short when chella runs them off varys hooted as if that was the funniest thing he had ever heard but there was no laughter in his eyes when he turned them on tyrion your young lady has an amiable way to her i should take very good care of her if i were you i intend to any man who tries to harm herwell im too small to be a black ear and i make no claims to courage see i speak the same tongue you do eunuch hurt her and ill have your head i will leave you varys rose i know how weary you must be i only wished to welcome you my lord and tell you how very pleased i am by your arrival we have dire need of you on the council have you seen the comet im short not blind tyrion said out on the kingsroad it had seemed to cover half the sky outshining the crescent moon in the streets they call it the red messenger varys said they say it comes as a herald before a king to warn of fire and blood to follow the eunuch rubbed his powdered hands together may i leave you with a bit of a riddle lord tyrion he did not wait for an answer in a room sit three great men a king a priest and a rich man with his gold between them stands a sellsword a little man of common birth and no great mind each of the great ones bids him slay the other two do it says the king for i am your lawful ruler do it says the priest for i command you in the names of the gods do it says the rich man and all this gold shall be yours so tell mewho lives and who dies bowing deeply the eunuch hurried from the common room on soft slippered feet when he was gone chella gave a snort and shae wrinkled up her pretty face the rich man lives doesnt he tyrion sipped at his wine thoughtful perhaps or not that would depend on the sellsword it seems he set down his cup come lets go upstairs she had to wait for him at the top of the steps for her legs were slim and supple while his were short and stunted and full of aches but she was smiling when he reached her did you miss me she teased as she took his hand desperately tyrion admitted shae only stood a shade over five feet yet still he must look up to her but in her case he found he did not mind she was sweet to look up at youll miss me all the time in your red keep she said as she led him to her room all alone in your cold bed in your tower of the hand too true tyrion would gladly have kept her with him but his lord father had forbidden it you will not take the whore to court lord tywin had commanded bringing her to the city was as much defiance as he dared all his authority derived from his father the girl had to understand that you wont be far he promised youll have a house with guards and servants and ill visit as often as im able page shae kicked shut the door through the cloudy panes of the narrow window he could make out the great sept of baelor crowning visenyas hill but tyrion was distracted by a different sight bending shae took her gown by the hem drew it over her head and tossed it aside she did not believe in smallclothes youll never be able to rest she said as she stood before him pink and nude and lovely one hand braced on her hip youll think of me every time you go to bed then youll get hard and youll have no one to help you and youll never be able to sleep unless youshe grinned that wicked grin tyrion liked so wellis that why they call it the tower of the hand mlord be quiet and kiss me he commanded he could taste the wine on her lips and feel her small firm breasts pressed against him as her fingers moved to the lacings of his breeches my lion she whispered when he broke off the kiss to undress my sweet lord my giant of lannister tyrion pushed her toward the bed when he entered her she screamed loud enough to wake baelor the blessed in his tomb and her nails left gouges in his back hed never had a pain he liked half so well fool he thought to himself afterward as they lay in the center of the sagging mattress amidst the rumpled sheets will you never learn dwarf shes a whore damn you its your coin she loves not your cock remember tysha yet when his fingers trailed lightly over one nipple it stiffened at the touch and he could see the mark on her breast where hed bitten her in his passion so what will you do mlord now that youre the hand of the king shae asked him as he cupped that warm sweet flesh something cersei will never expect tyrion murmured softly against her slender neck ill do justice chapter bran bran preferred the hard stone of the window seat to the comforts of his featherbed and blankets abed the walls pressed close and the ceiling hung heavy above him abed the room was his cell and winterfell his prison yet outside his window the wide world still called he could not walk nor climb nor hunt nor fight with a wooden sword as once he had but he could still look he liked to watch the windows begin to glow all over winterfell as candles and hearth fires were lit behind the diamondshaped panes of tower and hall and he loved to listen to the direwolves sing to the stars of late he often dreamed of wolves they are talking to me brother to brother he told himself when the direwolves howled he could almost understand them not quite not truly but almost as if they were singing in a language he had once known and somehow forgotten the walders might be scared of them but the starks had wolf blood old nan told him so though it is stronger in some than in others she warned page summers howls were long and sad full of grief and longing shaggydogs were more savage their voices echoed through the yards and halls until the castle rang and it seemed as though some great pack of direwolves haunted winterfell instead of only two two where there had once been six do they miss their brothers and sisters too bran wondered are they calling to grey wind and ghost to nymeria and ladys shade do they want them to come home and be a pack together who can know the mind of a wolf ser rodrik cassel said when bran asked him why they howled brans lady mother had named him castellan of winterfell in her absence and his duties left him little time for idle questions its freedom theyre calling for declared farlen who was kennelmaster and had no more love for the direwolves than his hounds did they dont like being walled up and whos to blame them wild things belong in the wild not in a castle they want to hunt agreed gage the cook as he tossed cubes of suet in a great kettle of stew a wolf smells bettern any man like as not theyve caught the scent o prey maester luwin did not think so wolves often howl at the moon these are howling at the comet see how bright it is bran perchance they think it is the moon when bran repeated that to osha she laughed aloud your wolves have more wit than your maester the wildling woman said they know truths the grey man has forgotten the way she said it made him shiver and when he asked what the comet meant she answered blood and fire boy and nothing sweet bran asked septon chayle about the comet while they were sorting through some scrolls snatched from the library fire it is the sword that slays the season he replied and soon after the white raven came from oldtown bringing word of autumn so doubtless he was right though old nan did not think so and shed lived longer than any of them dragons she said lifting her head and sniffing she was near blind and could not see the comet yet she claimed she could smell it it be dragons boy she insisted bran got no princes from nan no more than he ever had hodor said only hodor that was all he ever said and still the direwolves howled the guards on the walls muttered curses hounds in the kennels barked furiously horses kicked at their stalls the walders shivered by their fire and even maester luwin complained of sleepless nights only bran did not mind ser rodrik had confined the wolves to the godswood after shaggydog bit little walder but the stones of winterfell played queer tricks with sound and sometimes it sounded as if they were in the yard right below brans window other times he would have sworn they were up on the curtain walls loping round like sentries he wished that he could see them he could see the comet hanging above the guards hall and the bell tower and farther back the first keep squat and round its gargoyles black shapes against the bruised purple dusk once bran had known every stone of those buildings inside and out he had climbed them all scampering up walls as easily as page other boys ran down stairs their rooftops had been his secret places and the crows atop the broken tower his special friends and then he had fallen bran did not remember falling yet they said he had so he supposed it must be true he had almost died when he saw the weatherworn gargoyles atop the first keep where it had happened he got a queer tight feeling in his belly and now he could not climb nor walk nor run nor swordfight and the dreams hed dreamed of knighthood had soured in his head summer had howled the day bran had fallen and for long after as he lay broken in his bed robb had told him so before he went away to war summer had mourned for him and shaggydog and grey wind had joined in his grief and the night the bloody raven had brought word of their fathers death the wolves had known that too bran had been in the maesters turret with rickon talking of the children of the forest when summer and shaggydog had drowned out luwin with their howls who are they mourning now had some enemy slain the king in the north who used to be his brother robb had his bastard brother jon snow fallen from the wall had his mother died or one of his sisters or was this something else as maester and septon and old nan seemed to think if i were truly a direwolf i would understand the song he thought wistfully in his wolf dreams he could race up the sides of mountains jagged icy mountains taller than any tower and stand at the summit beneath the full moon with all the world below him the way it used to be oooo bran cried tentatively he cupped his hands around his mouth and lifted his head to the comet ooooooooooooooooooo ahooooooooooooooo he howled it sounded stupid high and hollow and quavering a little boys howl not a wolfs yet summer gave answer his deep voice drowning out brans thin one and shaggydog made it a chorus bran haroooed again they howled together last of their pack the noise brought a guard to his door hayhead with the wen on his nose he peered in saw bran howling out the window and said whats this my prince it made bran feel queer when they called him prince though he was robbs heir and robb was king in the north now he turned his head to howl at the guard oooooooo oooooooooooooooo hayhead screwed up his face now you stop that there ooooooooo oooooooooooooooooooo the guardsman retreated when he came back maester luwin was with him all in grey his chain tight about his neck bran those beasts make sufficient noise without your help he crossed the room and put his hand on the boys brow the hour grows late you ought to be fast asleep im talking to the wolves bran brushed the hand away page shall i have hayhead carry you to your bed i can get to bed myself mikken had hammered a row of iron bars into the wall so bran could pull himself about the room with his arms it was slow and hard and it made his shoulders ache but he hated being carried anyway i dont have to sleep if i dont want to all men must sleep bran even princes when i sleep i turn into a wolf bran turned his face away and looked back out into the night do wolves dream all creatures dream i think yet not as men do do dead men dream bran asked thinking of his father in the dark crypts below winterfell a stonemason was chiseling out his fathers likeness in granite some say yes some no the maester answered the dead themselves are silent on the matter do trees dream trees no they do bran said with sudden certainty they dream tree dreams i dream of a tree sometimes a weirwood like the one in the godswood it calls to me the wolf dreams are better i smell things and sometimes i can taste the blood maester luwin tugged at his chain where it chafed his neck if you would only spend more time with the other children i hate the other children bran said meaning the walders i commanded you to send them away luwin grew stern the freys are your lady mothers wards sent here to be fostered at her express command it is not for you to expel them nor is it kind if we turned them out where would they go home its their fault you wont let me have summer the frey boy did not ask to be attacked the maester said no more than i did that was shaggydog rickons big black wolf was so wild he even frightened bran at times summer never bit anyone summer ripped out a mans throat in this very chamber or have you forgotten the truth is those sweet pups you and your brothers found in the snow have grown into dangerous beasts the frey boys are wise to be wary of them we should put the walders in the godswood they could play lord of the crossing all they want and summer could sleep with me again if im the prince why wont you heed me i wanted to ride dancer but alebelly wouldnt let me past the gate and rightly so the wolfswood is full of danger your last ride should have taught you that would you page want some outlaw to take you captive and sell you to the lannisters summer would save me bran insisted stubbornly princes should be allowed to sail the sea and hunt boar in the wolfswood and joust with lances bran child why do you torment yourself so one day you may do some of these things but now you are only a boy of eight id sooner be a wolf then i could live in the wood and sleep when i wanted and i could find arya and sansa id smell where they were and go save them and when robb went to battle id fight beside him like grey wind id tear out the kingslayers throat with my teeth rip and then the war would be over and everyone would come back to winterfell if i was a wolf he howled oooooooooooooooooo luwin raised his voice a true prince would welcorne aahooooooo bran howled louder aah the maester surrendered as you will child with a look that was part grief and part disgust he left the bedchamber howling lost its savor once bran was alone after a time he quieted i did welcome them he told himself resentful i was the lord in winterfell a true lord he cant say i wasnt when the walders had arrived from the twins it had been rickon who wanted them gone a baby of four he had screamed that he wanted mother and father and robb not these strangers it had been up to bran to soothe him and bid the freys welcome he had offered them meat and mead and a seat by the fire and even maester luwin had said afterward that hed done well only that was before the game the game was played with a log a staff a body of water and a great deal of shouting the water was the most important walder and walder assured bran you could use a plank or even a series of stones and a branch could be your staff you didnt have to shout but without water there was no game as maester luwin and ser rodrik were not about to let the children go wandering off into the wolfswood in search of a stream they made do with one of the murky pools in the godswood walder and walder had never seen hot water bubbling from the ground before but they both allowed how it would make the game even better both of them were called walder frey big walder said there were bunches of walders at the twins all named after the boys grandfather lord walder frey we have our own names at winterfell rickon told them haughtily when he heard that the way their game was played you laid the log across the water and one player stood in the middle with the stick he was the lord of the crossing and when one of the other players came up he had to say i am the lord of the crossing who goes there and the other player had to make up a speech about who they were and why they should be allowed to cross the lord could make them swear oaths and answer questions they didnt have to tell the truth but the oaths were binding unless they said maybaps so the trick was to say mayhaps so the lord of the crossing didnt notice then you could try and knock the lord into the water and you got to be lord of the crossing but only if youd said mayhaps otherwise you were out of the game the lord got to knock anyone in the water anytime he page pleased and he was the only one who got to use a stick in practice the game seemed to come down to mostly shoving hitting and falling into the water along with a lot of loud arguments about whether or not someone had said mayhaps little walder was lord of the crossing more often than not he was little walder even though he was tall and stout with a red face and a big round belly big walder was sharpfaced and skinny and half a foot shorter hes fiftytwo days older than me little walder explained so he was bigger at first but i grew faster were cousins not brothers added big walder the little one im walder son of jammos my father was lord walders son by his fourth wife hes walder son of merrett his grandmother was lord walders third wife the crakehall hes ahead of me in the line of succession even though im older only by fiftytwo days little walder objected and neither of us will ever hold the twins stupid i will big walder declared were not the only walders either ser stevron has a grandson black walder hes fourth in line of succession and theres red walder ser emmons son and bastard walder who isnt in the line at all hes called walder rivers not walder frey plus theres girls named walda and tyr you always forget tyr hes waltyr not walder big walder said airily and hes after us so he doesnt matter anyhow i never liked him ser rodrik decreed that they would share jon snows old bedchamber since jon was in the nights watch and never coming back bran hated that it made him feel as if the freys were trying to steal jons place he had watched wistfully while the walders contested with turnip the cooks boy and joseths girls bandy and shyra the walders had decreed that bran should be the judge and decide whether or not people had said maybaps but as soon as they started playing they forgot all about him the shouts and splashes soon drew others palla the kennel girl cayns boy calon tomtoo whose father fat tom had died with brans father at kings landing before very long every one of them was soaked and muddy palla was brown from head to heel with moss in her hair breathless from laughter bran had not heard so much laughing since the night the bloody raven came if i had my legs id knock all of them into the water he thought bitterly no one would ever be lord of the crossing but me finally rickon came running into the godswood shaggydog at his heels he watched turnip and little walder struggle for the stick until turnip lost his footing and went in with a huge splash arms waving rickon yelled me me now i want to play little walder beckoned him on and shaggydog started to follow no shaggy his brother commanded wolves cant play you stay with bran and he did until little walder had smacked rickon with the stick square across his belly before bran could blink the black wolf was flying over the plank there was blood in the water the walders were shrieking red murder rickon sat in the mud laughing and hodor came lumbering in shouting hodor hodor hodor after that oddly rickon decided he liked the walders they never played lord of the crossing again page but they played other gamesmonsters and maidens rats and cats comeintomycastle all sorts of things with rickon by their side the walders plundered the kitchens for pies and honeycombs raced round the walls tossed bones to the pups in the kennels and trained with wooden swords under ser rodriks sharp eye rickon even showed them the deep vaults under the earth where the stonemason was carving fathers tomb you had no right bran screamed at his brother when he heard that was our place a stark place but rickon never cared the door to his bedchamber opened maester luwin was carrying a green jar and this time osha and hayhead came with him ive made you a sleeping draught bran osha scooped him up in her bony arms she was very tall for a woman and wiry strong she bore him effortlessly to his bed this will give you dreamless sleep maester luwin said as he pulled the stopper from the jar sweet dreamless sleep it will bran said wanting to believe yes drink bran drank the potion was thick and chalky but there was honey in it so it went down easy come the morn youll feel better luwin gave bran a smile and a pat as he took his leave osha lingered behind is it the wolf dreams again bran nodded you should not fight so hard boy i see you talking to the heart tree might be the gods are trying to talk back the gods he murmured drowsy already oshas face grew blurry and grey sweet dreamless sleep bran thought yet when the darkness closed over him he found himself in the godswood moving silently beneath greengrey sentinels and gnarled oaks as old as time i am walking he thought exulting part of him knew that it was only a dream but even the dream of walking was better than the truth of his bedchamber walls and ceiling and door it was dark amongst the trees but the comet lit his way and his feet were sure he was moving on four good legs strong and swift and he could feel the ground underfoot the soft crackling of fallen leaves thick roots and hard stones the deep layers of humus it was a good feeling the smells filled his head alive and intoxicating the green muddy stink of the hot pools the perfume of rich rotting earth beneath his paws the squirrels in the oaks the scent of squirrel made him remember the taste of hot blood and the way the bones would crack between his teeth slaver filled his mouth he had eaten no more than half a day past but there was no joy in dead meat even deer he could hear the squirrels chittering and rustling above him safe among their leaves but they knew better than to come down to where his brother and he were prowling he could smell his brother too a familiar scent strong and earthy his scent as black as his coat his page brother was loping around the walls full of fury round and round he went night after day after night tireless searching for prey for a way out for his mother his littermates his pack searching searching and never finding behind the trees the walls rose piles of dead manrock that loomed all about this speck of living wood speckled grey they rose and mossspotted yet thick and strong and higher than any wolf could hope to leap cold iron and splintery wood closed off the only holes through the piled stones that hemmed them in his brother would stop at every hole and bare his fangs in rage but the ways stayed closed he had done the same the first night and learned that it was no good snarls would open no paths here circling the walls would not push them back lifting a leg and marking the trees would keep no men away the world had tightened around them but beyond the walled wood still stood the great grey caves of manrock winterfell he remembered the sound coming to him suddenly beyond its skytall mancliffs the true world was calling and he knew he must answer or die chapter arya they traveled dawn to dusk past woods and orchards and neatly tended fields through small villages crowded market towns and stout holdfasts come dark they would make camp and eat by the light of the red sword the men took turns standing watch arya would glimpse firelight flickering through the trees from the camps of other travelers there seemed to be more camps every night and more traffic on the kingsroad by day morn noon and night they came old folks and little children big men and small ones barefoot girls and women with babes at their breasts some drove farm wagons or bumped along in the back of ox carts more rode draft horses ponies mules donkeys anything that would walk or run or roll one woman led a milk cow with a little girl on its back arya saw a smith pushing a wheelbarrow with his tools inside hammers and tongs and even an anvil and a little while later a different man with a different wheelbarrow only inside this one were two babies in a blanket most came on foot with their goods on their shoulders and weary wary looks upon their faces they walked south toward the city toward kings landing and only one in a hundred spared so much as a word for yoren and his charges traveling north she wondered why no one else was going the same way as them many of the travelers were armed arya saw daggers and dirks scythes and axes and here and there a sword some had made clubs from tree limbs or carved knobby staffs they fingered their weapons and gave lingering looks at the wagons as they rolled by yet in the end they let the column pass thirty was too many no matter what they had in those wagons look with your eyes syrio had said listen with your ears one day a madwoman began to scream at them from the side of the road fools theyll kill you page fools she was scarecrow thin with hollow eyes and bloody feet the next morning a sleek merchant on a grey mare reined up by yoren and offered to buy his wagons and everything in them for a quarter of their worth its war theyll take what they want youll do better selling to me my friend yoren turned away with a twist of his crooked shoulders and spat arya noticed the first grave that same day a small mound beside the road dug for a child a crystal had been set in the soft earth and lommy wanted to take it until the bull told him hed better leave the dead alone a few leagues farther on praed pointed out more graves a whole row freshly dug after that a day hardly passed without one one time arya woke in the dark frightened for no reason she could name above the red sword shared the sky with half a thousand stars the night seemed oddly quiet to her though she could hear yorens muttered snores the crackle of the fire even the muffled stirrings of the donkeys yet somehow it felt as though the world were holding its breath and the silence made her shiver she went back to sleep clutching needle come morning when praed did not awaken arya realized that it had been his coughing she had missed they dug a grave of their own then burying the sellsword where hed slept yoren stripped him of his valuables before they threw the dirt on him one man claimed his boots another his dagger his mail shirt and helm were parceled out his longsword yoren handed to the bull arms like yours might be you can learn to use this he told him a boy called tarber tossed a handful of acorns on top of praeds body so an oak might grow to mark his place that evening they stopped in a village at an ivycovered inn yoren counted the coins in his purse and decided they had enough for a hot meal well sleep outside same as ever but they got a bathhouse here if any of you feels the need o hot water and a lick o soap arya did not dare even though she smelled as bad as yoren by now all sour and stinky some of the creatures living in her clothes had come all the way from flea bottom with her it didnt seem right to drown them tarber and hot pie and the bull joined the line of men headed for the tubs others settled down in front of the bathhouse the rest crowded into the common room yoren even sent lommy out with tankards for the three in fetters whod been left chained up in the back of their wagon washed and unwashed alike supped on hot pork pies and baked apples the innkeeper gave them a round of beer on the house i had a brother took the black years ago serving boy clever but one day he got seen filching pepper from mlords table he liked the taste of it is all just a pinch o pepper but ser malcolm was a hard man you get pepper on the wall when yoren shook his head the man sighed shame lync loved that pepper arya sipped at her tankard cautiously between spoonfuls of pie still warm from the oven her father sometimes let them have a cup of beer she remembered sansa used to make a face at the taste and say that wine was ever so much finer but arya had liked it well enough it made her sad to think of sansa and her father the inn was full of people moving south and the common room erupted in scorn when yoren said they were traveling the other way youll be back soon enough the innkeeper vowed theres no going north half the fields are burnt and what folks are left are walled up inside their holdfasts one bunch rides off at dawn and another one shows up by dusk page thats nothing to us yoren insisted stubbornly tully or lannister makes no matter the watch takes no part lord tully is my grandfather arya thought it mattered to her but she chewed her lip and kept quiet listening its more than lannister and tully the innkeeper said theres wild men down from the mountains of the moon try telling them you take no part and the starks are in it too the young lords come down the dead hands son arya sat up straight straining to hear did he mean robb i heard the boy rides to battle on a wolf said a yellowhaired man with a tankard in his hand fools talk yoren spat the man i heard it from he saw it himself a wolf big as a horse he swore swearing dont make it true hod the innkeeper said you keep swearing youll pay what you owe me and ive yet to see a copper the common room erupted in laughter and the man with the yellow hair turned red its been a bad year for wolves volunteered a sallow man in a travelstained green cloak around the gods eye the packs have grown boldern anyone can remember sheep cows dogs makes no matter they kill as they like and they got no fear of men its worth your life to go into those woods by night ah thats more tales and no more true than the other i heard the same thing from my cousin and shes not the sort to lie an old woman said she says theres this great pack hundreds of them mankillers the one that leads them is a shewolf a bitch from the seventh hell a shewolf arya sloshed her beer wondering was the gods eye near the trident she wished she had a map it had been near the trident that shed left nymeria she hadnt wanted to but jory said they had no choice that if the wolf came back with them shed be killed for biting joffrey even though hed deserved it theyd had to shout and scream and throw stones and it wasnt until a few of aryas stones struck home that the direwolf had finally stopped following them she probably wouldnt even know me now arya thought or if she did shed hate me the man in the green cloak said i heard how this hellbitch walked into a village one day a market day people everywhere and she walks in bold as you please and tears a baby from his mothers arms when the tale reached lord mooton him and his sons swore theyd put an end to her they tracked her to her lair with a pack of wolfhounds and barely escaped with their skins not one of those dogs came back not one thats just a story arya blurted out before she could stop herself wolves dont eat babies and what would you know about it lad asked the man in the green cloak before she could think of an answer yoren had her by the arm the boys greensick on beer thats all page it is no im not they dont eat babies outside boy and see that you stay there until you learn to shut your mouth when men are talking he gave her a stiff shove toward the side door that led back to the stables go on now see that the stableboy has watered our horses arya went outside stiff with fury they dont she muttered kicking at a rock as she stalked off it went rolling and fetched up under the wagons boy a friendly voice called out lovely boy one of the men in irons was talking to her warily arya approached the wagon one hand on needles hilt the prisoner lifted an empty tankard his chains rattling a man could use another taste of beer a man has a thirst wearing these heavy bracelets he was the youngest of the three slender finefeatured always smiling his hair was red on one side and white on the other all matted and filthy from cage and travel a man could use a bath too he said when he saw the way arya was looking at him a boy could make a friend i have friends arya said none i can see said the one without a nose he was squat and thick with huge hands black hair covered his arms and legs and chest even his back he reminded arya of a drawing she had once seen in a book of an ape from the summer isles the hole in his face made it hard to look at him for long the bald one opened his mouth and hissed like some immense white lizard when arya flinched back startled he opened his mouth wide and waggled his tongue at her only it was more a stump than a tongue stop that she blurted a man does not choose his companions in the black cells the handsome one with the redandwhite hair said something about the way he talked reminded her of syrio it was the same yet different too these two they have no courtesy a man must ask forgiveness you are called arry is that not so lumpyhead said the noseless one lumpyhead lumpyface stickboy have a care lorath hell hit you with his stick a man must be ashamed of the company he keeps arry the handsome one said this man has the honor to be jaqen hghar once of the free city of lorath would that he were home this mans illbred companions in captivity are named rorgehe waved his tankard at the noseless manand biter biter hissed at her again displaying a mouthful of yellowed teeth filed into points a man must have some name is that not so biter cannot speak and biter cannot write yet his teeth are very sharp so a man calls him biter and he smiles are you charmed arya backed away from the wagon no they cant hurt me she told herself theyre all chained up he turned his tankard upside down a man must weep page rorge the noseless one flung his drinking cup at her with a curse his manacles made him clumsy yet even so he would have sent the heavy pewter tankard crashing into her head if arya hadnt leapt aside you get us some beer pimple now you shut your mouth arya tried to think what syrio would have done she drew her wooden practice sword come closer rorge said and ill shove that stick up your bunghole and fuck you bloody fear cuts deeper than swords arya made herself approach the wagon every step was harder than the one before fierce as a wolverine calm as still water the words sang in her head syrio would not have been afraid she was almost close enough to touch the wheel when biter lurched to his feet and grabbed for her his irons clanking and rattling the manacles brought his hands up short half a foot from her face he hissed she hit him hard right between his little eyes screaming biter reeled back and then threw all his weight against his chains the links slithered and turned and grew taut and arya heard the creak of old dry wood as the great iron rings strained against the floorboards of the wagon huge pale hands groped for her while veins bulged along biters arms but the bonds held and finally the man collapsed backward blood ran from the weeping sores on his cheeks a boy has more courage than sense the one who had named himself jaqen hghar observed arya edged backward away from the wagon when she felt the hand on her shoulder she whirled bringing up her stick sword again but it was only the bull what are you doing he raised his hands defensively yoren said none of us should go near those three they dont scare me arya said then youre stupid they scare me the bulls hand fell to the hilt of his sword and rorge began to laugh lets get away from them arya scuffed at the ground with her foot but she let the bull lead her around to the front of the inn rorges laughter and biters hissing followed them want to fight she asked the bull she wanted to hit something he blinked at her startled strands of thick black hair still wet from the bathhouse fell across his deep blue eyes id hurt you you would not you dont know how strong i am you dont know how quick i am youre asking for it arry he drew praeds longsword this is cheap steel but its a real sword page arya unsheathed needle this is good steel so its realer than yours the bull shook his head promise not to cry if i cut you ill promise if you will she turned sideways into her water dancers stance but the bull did not move he was looking at something behind her whats wrong gold cloaks his face closed up tight it couldnt be arya thought but when she glanced back they were riding up the kingsroad six in the black ringmail and golden cloaks of the city watch one was an officer he wore a black enamel breastplate ornamented with four golden disks they drew up in front of the inn look with your eyes syrios voice seemed to whisper her eyes saw white lather under their saddles the horses had been ridden long and hard calm as still water she took the bull by the arm and drew him back behind a tall flowering hedge what is it he asked what are you doing let go quiet as a shadow she whispered pulling him down some of yorens other charges were sitting in front of the bathhouse waiting their turn at a tub you men one of the gold cloaks shouted you the ones left to take the black we might be came the cautious answer wed rather join you boys old reysen said we hear its cold on that wall the gold cloak officer dismounted i have a warrant for a certain boy yoren stepped out of the inn fingering his tangled black beard who is it wants this boy the other gold cloaks were dismounting to stand beside their horses why are we hiding the bull whispered its me they want arya whispered back his ear smelled of soap you be quiet the queen wants him old man not that its your concern the officer said drawing a ribbon from his belt here her graces seal and warrant behind the hedge the bull shook his head doubtfully why would the queen want you arry she punched his shoulder be quiet yoren fingered the warrant ribbon with its blob of golden wax pretty he spit thing is the boys in the nights watch now what he done back in the city dont mean pissall the queens not interested in your views old man and neither am i the officer said ill have the boy arya thought about running but she knew she wouldnt get far on her donkey when the gold cloaks had horses and she was so tired of running shed run when ser meryn came for her and again when they page killed her father if she was a real water dancer she would go out there with needle and kill all of them and never run from anyone ever again youll have no one yoren said stubbornly theres laws on such things the gold cloak drew a shortsword heres your law yoren looked at the blade thats no law just a sword happens i got one too the officer smiled old fool i have five men with me yoren spat happens i got thirty the gold cloak laughed this lot said a big lout with a broken nose whos first he shouted showing his steel tarber plucked a pitchfork out of a bale of hay i am no i am called cutjack the plump stonemason pulling his hammer off the leather apron he always wore me kurz came up off the ground with his skinning knife in hand me and him koss strung his longbow all of us said reysen snatching up the tall hardwood walking staff he carried dobber stepped naked out of the bathhouse with his clothes in a bundle saw what was happening and dropped everything but his dagger is it a fight he asked i guess said hot pie scrambling on all fours for a big rock to throw arya could not believe what she was seeing she hated hot pie why would he risk himself for her the one with the broken nose still thought it was funny you girls put away them rocks and sticks before you get spanked none of you knows what end of a sword to hold i do arya wouldnt let them die for her like syrio she wouldnt shoving through the hedge with needle in hand she slid into a water dancers stance broken nose guffawed the officer looked her up and down put the blade away little girl no one wants to hurt you im not a girl she yelled furious what was wrong with them they rode all this way for her and here she was and they were just smiling at her im the one you want hes the one we want the officer jabbed his shortsword toward the bull whod come forward to stand beside her praeds cheap steel in his hand but it was a mistake to take his eyes off yoren even for an instant quick as that the black brothers sword was pressed to the apple of the officers throat neithers the one you get less you want me to see if your apples ripe yet i got me ten fifteen more brothers in that inn if you still need convincing i page was you id let loose of that gutcutter spread my cheeks over that fat little horse and gallop on back to the city he spat and poked harder with the point of his sword now the officers fingers uncurled his sword fell in the dust well just keep that yoren said good steels always needed on the wall as you say for now men the gold cloaks sheathed and mounted up youd best scamper up to that wall of yours in a hurry old man the next time i catch you i believe ill have your head to go with the bastard boys better men than you have tried yoren slapped the rump of the officers horse with the flat of his sword and sent him reeling off down the kingsroad his men followed when they were out of sight hot pie began to whoop but yoren looked angrier than ever fool you think hes done with us next time he wont prance up and hand me no damn ribbon get the rest out o them baths we need to be moving ride all night maybe we can stay ahead o them for a bit he scooped up the shortsword the officer had dropped who wants this me hot pie yelled dont be using it on arry he handed the boy the sword hilt first and walked over to arya but it was the bull he spoke to queen wants you bad boy arya was lost why should she want him the bull scowled at her why should she want you youre nothing but a little gutter rat well youre nothing but a bastard boy or maybe he was only pretending to be a bastard boy whats your true name gendry he said like he wasnt quite sure dont see why no one wants neither o you yoren said but they cant have you regardless you ride them two coursers first sight of a gold cloak make for the wall like a dragons on your tail the rest o us dont mean spit to them except for you arya pointed out that man said hed take your head too well as to that yoren said if he can get it off my shoulders hes welcome to it chapter jon page sam jon called softly the air smelled of paper and dust and years before him tall wooden shelves rose up into dimness crammed with leatherbound books and bins of ancient scrolls a faint yellow glow filtered through the stacks from some hidden lamp jon blew out the taper he carried preferring not to risk an open flame amidst so much old dry paper instead he followed the light wending his way down the narrow aisles beneath barrelvaulted ceilings all in black he was a shadow among shadows dark of hair long of face grey of eye black moleskin gloves covered his hands the right because it was burned the left because a man felt half a fool wearing only one glove samwell tarly sat hunched over a table in a niche carved into the stone of the wall the glow came from the lamp hung over his head he looked up at the sound of jons steps have you been here all night have i sam looked startled you didnt break your fast with us and your bed hadnt been slept in rast suggested that maybe sam had deserted but jon never believed it desertion required its own sort of courage and sam had little enough of that is it morning down here theres no way to know sam youre a sweet fool jon said youll miss that bed when were sleeping on the cold hard ground i promise you sam yawned maester aemon sent me to find maps for the lord commander i never thought jon the books have you ever seen their like there are thousands he gazed about him the library at winterfell has more than a hundred did you find the maps oh yes sams hand swept over the table fingers plump as sausages indicating the clutter of books and scrolls before him a dozen at the least he unfolded a square of parchment the paint has faded but you can see where the mapmaker marked the sites of wildling villages and theres another book where is it now i was reading it a moment ago he shoved some scrolls aside to reveal a dusty volume bound in rotted leather this he said reverently is the account of a journey from the shadow tower all the way to lorn point on the frozen shore written by a ranger named redwyn its not dated but he mentions a dorren stark as king in the north so it must be from before the conquest jon they fought giants redwyn even traded with the children of the forest its all here ever so delicately he turned pages with a finger he drew maps as well see maybe you could write an account of our ranging sam hed meant to sound encouraging but it was the wrong thing to say the last thing sam needed was to be reminded of what faced them on the morrow he shuffled the scrolls about aimlessly theres more maps if i had time to search everythings a jumble i could set it all to order though i know i could but it would take time well years in truth mormont wanted those maps a little sooner than that jon plucked a scroll from a bin blew off the worst of the dust a corner flaked off between his fingers as he unrolled it look this one is crumbling page he said frowning over the faded script be gentle sam came around the table and took the scroll from his hand holding it as if it were a wounded animal the important books used to be copied over when they needed them some of the oldest have been copied half a hundred times probably well dont bother copying that one twentythree barrels of pickled cod eighteen jars of fish oil a cask of salt an inventory sam said or perhaps a bill of sale who cares how much pickled cod they ate six hundred years ago jon wondered i would sam carefully replaced the scroll in the bin from which jon had plucked it you can learn so much from ledgers like that truly you can it can tell you how many men were in the nights watch then how they lived what they ate they ate food said jon and they lived as we live youd be surprised this vault is a treasure jon if you say so jon was doubtful treasure meant gold silver and jewels not dust spiders and rotting leather i do the fat boy blurted he was older than jon a man grown by law but it was hard to think of him as anything but a boy i found drawings of the faces in the trees and a book about the tongue of the children of the forest works that even the citadel doesnt have scrolls from old valyria counts of the seasons written by maesters dead a thousand years the books will still be here when we return if we return the old bear is taking two hundred seasoned men threequarters of them rangers qhorin halfhand will be bringing another hundred brothers from the shadow tower youll be as safe as if you were back in your lord fathers castle at horn hill samwell tarly managed a sad little smile i was never very safe in my fathers castle either the gods play cruel jests jon thought pyp and toad all a lather to be a part of the great ranging were to remain at castle black it was samwell tarly the selfproclaimed coward grossly fat timid and near as bad a rider as he was with a sword who must face the haunted forest the old bear was taking two cages of ravens so they might send back word as they went maester aemon was blind and far too frail to ride with them so his steward must go in his place we need you for the ravens sam and someone has to help me keep grenn humble sams chins quivered you could care for the ravens or grenn could or anyone he said with a thin edge of desperation in his voice i could show you how you know your letters too you could write down lord mormonts messages as well as i im the old bears steward ill need to squire for him tend his horse set up his tent i wont have time page to watch over birds as well sam you said the words youre a brother of the nights watch now a brother of the nights watch shouldnt be so scared were all scared wed be fools if we werent too many rangers had been lost the past two years even benjen stark jons uncle they had found two of his uncles men in the wood slain but the corpses had risen in the chill of night jons burnt fingers twitched as he remembered he still saw the wight in his dreams dead othor with the burning blue eyes and the cold black hands but that was the last thing sam needed to be reminded of theres no shame in fear my father told me what matters is how we face it come ill help you gather up the maps sam nodded unhappily the shelves were so closely spaced that they had to walk single file as they left the vault opened onto one of the tunnels the brothers called the wormwalks winding subterranean passages that linked the keeps and towers of castle black under the earth in summer the wormwalks were seldom used save by rats and other vermin but winter was a different matter when the snows drifted forty and fifty feet high and the ice winds came howling out of the north the tunnels were all that held castle black together soon jon thought as they climbed hed seen the harbinger that had come to maester aemon with word of summers end the great raven of the citadel white and silent as ghost he had seen a winter once when he was very young but everyone agreed that it had been a short one and mild this one would be different he could feel it in his bones the steep stone steps had sam puffing like a blacksmiths bellows by the time they reached the surface they emerged into a brisk wind that made jons cloak swirl and snap ghost was stretched out asleep beneath the wattleanddaub wall of the granary but he woke when jon appeared bushy white tail held stiffly upright as he trotted to them sam squinted up at the wall it loomed above them an icy cliff seven hundred feet high sometimes it seemed to jon almost a living thing with moods of its own the color of the ice was wont to change with every shift of the light now it was the deep blue of frozen rivers now the dirty white of old snow and when a cloud passed before the sun it darkened to the pale grey of pitted stone the wall stretched east and west as far as the eye could see so huge that it shrunk the timbered keeps and stone towers of the castle to insignificance it was the end of the world and we are going beyond it the morning sky was streaked by thin grey clouds but the pale red line was there behind them the black brothers had dubbed the wanderer mormonts torch saying only half in jest that the gods must have sent it to light the old mans way through the haunted forest the comets so bright you can see it by day now sam said shading his eyes with a fistful of books never mind about comets its maps the old bear wants ghost loped ahead of them the grounds seemed deserted this morning with so many rangers off at the brothel in moles town digging for buried treasure and drinking themselves blind grenn had gone with them pyp and halder and toad had offered to buy him his first woman to celebrate his first ranging theyd wanted jon and sam to come as well but sam was almost as frightened of whores as he was of the haunted forest and jon had wanted no part of it do what you want he told toad i took a vow page as they passed the sept he heard voices raised in song some men want whores on the eve of battle and some want gods jon wondered who felt better afterward the sept tempted him no more than the brothel his own gods kept their temples in the wild places where the weirwoods spread their bonewhite branches the seven have no power beyond the wall he thought but my gods will be waiting outside the armory ser endrew tarth was working with some raw recruits theyd come in last night with conwy one of the wandering crows who roamed the seven kingdoms collecting men for the wall this new crop consisted of a greybeard leaning on a staff two blond boys with the look of brothers a foppish youth in soiled satin a raggy man with a clubfoot and some grinning loon who must have fancied himself a warrior ser endrew was showing him the error of that presumption he was a gentler masteratarms than ser alliser thorne had been but his lessons would still raise bruises sam winced at every blow but jon snow watched the swordplay closely what do you make of them snow donal noye stood in the door of his armory barechested under a leather apron the stump of his left arm uncovered for once with his big gut and barrel chest his flat nose and bristly black jaw noyc did not make a pretty sight but he was a welcome one nonetheless the armorer had proved himself a good friend they smell of summer jon said as ser endrew bullrushed his foe and knocked him sprawling where did conwy find them a lords dungeon near gulltown the smith replied a brigand a barber a beggar two orphans and a boy whore with such do we defend the realms of men theyll do jon gave sam a private smile we did noye drew him closer youve heard these tidings of your brother last night conwy and his charges had brought the news north with them and the talk in the common room had been of little else jon was still not certain how he felt about it robb a king the brother hed played with fought with shared his first cup of wine with but not mothers milk no so now robb will sip summerwine from jeweled goblets while im kneeling beside some stream sucking snowmelt from cupped hands robb will make a good king he said loyally will he now the smith eyed him frankly i hope thats so boy but once i might have said the same of robert they say you forged his warhammer jon remembered aye i was his man a baratheon man smith and armorer at storms end until i lost the arm im old enough to remember lord steffon before the sea took him and i knew those three sons of his since they got their names i tell you thisrobert was never the same after he put on that crown some men are like swords made for fighting hang them up and they go to rust and his brothers jon asked the armorer considered that a moment robert was the true steel stannis is pure iron black and hard and strong yes but brittle the way iron gets hell break before he bends and renly that one hes page copper bright and shiny pretty to look at but not worth all that much at the end of the day and what metal is robb jon did not ask noye was a baratheon man likely he thought joffrey the lawful king and robb a traitor among the brotherhood of the nights watch there was an unspoken pact never to probe too deeply into such matters men came to the wall from all of the seven kingdoms and old loves and loyalties were not easily forgotten no matter how many oaths a man swore as jon himself had good reason to know even samhis fathers house was sworn to highgarden whose lord tyrell supported king renly best not to talk of such things the nights watch took no sides lord mormont awaits us jon said i wont keep you from the old bear noye clapped him on the shoulder and smiled may the gods go with you on the morrow snow you bring back that uncle of yours you hear we will jon promised him lord commander mormont had taken up residence in the kings tower after the fire had gutted his own jon left ghost with the guards outside the door more stairs said sam miserably as they started up i hate stairs well thats one thing we wont face in the wood when they entered the solar the raven spied them at once snow the bird shrieked mormont broke off his conversation took you long enough with those maps he pushed the remains of breakfast out of the way to make room on the table put them here ill have a look at them later thoren smallwood a sinewy ranger with a weak chin and a weaker mouth hidden under a thin scraggle of beard gave jon and sam a cool look he had been one of alliser thornes henchmen and had no love for either of them the lord commanders place is at castle black lording and commanding he told mormont ignoring the newcomers it seems to me the raven flapped big black wings me me me if you are ever lord commander you may do as you please mormont told the ranger but it seems to me that i have not died yet nor have the brothers put you in my place im first ranger now with ben stark lost and ser jaremy killed smallwood said stubbornly the command should be mine mormont would have none of it i sent out ben stark and ser wayrnar before him i do not mean to send you after them and sit wondering how long i must wait before i give you up for lost as well he pointed and stark remains first ranger until we know for a certainty that he is dead should that day come it will be me who names his successor not you now stop wasting my time we ride at first light or have you forgotten smallwood pushed to his feet as my lord commands on the way out he frowned at jon as if it were somehow his fault first ranger the old bears eyes lighted on sam id sooner name you first ranger he has the effrontery to tell me to my face that im too old to ride with him do i look old to you boy the hair that had retreated from mormonts spotted scalp had regrouped beneath his chin in a shaggy grey beard that page covered much of his chest he thumped it hard do i look frail sam opened his mouth gave a little squeak the old bear terrified him no my lord jon offered quickly you look strong as a a dont cozen me snow you know i wont have it let me have a look at these maps mormont pawed through them brusquely giving each no more than a glance and a grunt was this all you could find i mmmy lord sam stammered there there were more bbbut the disdisorder these are old mormont complained and his raven echoed him with a sharp cry of old old the villages may come and go but the hills and rivers will be in the same places jon pointed out true enough have you chosen your ravens yet tarly mmmaester aemon mmeans to ppick them come evenfall after the fffeeding ill have his best smart birds and strong strong his own bird said preening strong strong if it happens that were all butchered out there i mean for my successor to know where and how we died talk of butchery reduced samwell tarly to speechlessness mormont leaned forward tarly when i was a lad half your age my lady mother told me that if i stood about with my mouth open a weasel was like to mistake it for his lair and run down my throat if you have something to say say it otherwise beware of weasels he waved a brusque dismissal off with you im too busy for folly no doubt the maester has some work you can do sam swallowed stepped back and scurried out so quickly he almost tripped over the rushes is that boy as big a fool as he seems the lord commander asked when hed gone fool the raven complained mormont did not wait for jon to answer his lord father stands high in king renlys councils and i had half a notion to dispatch him no best not renly is not like to heed a quaking fat boy ill send ser arnell hes a deal steadier and his mother was one of the greenapple fossoways if it please my lord what would you have of king renly the same things id have of all of them lad men horses swords armor grain cheese wine wool nails the nights watch is not proud we take what is offered his fingers drummed against the roughhewn planks of the table if the winds have been kind ser alliser should reach kings landing by the turn of the moon but whether this boy joffrey will pay him any heed i do not know house lannister has never been a friend to the watch thorne has the wights hand to show them a grisly pale thing with black fingers it was that twitched and stirred in its jar as if it were still alive page would that we had another hand to send to renly dywen says you can find anything beyond the wall aye dywen says and the last time he went ranging he says he saw a bear fifteen feet tall mormont snorted my sister is said to have taken a bear for her lover id believe that before id believe one fifteen feet tall though in a world where dead come walking ah even so a man must believe his eyes i have seen the dead walk ive not seen any giant bears he gave jon a long searching look but we were speaking of hands how is yours better jon peeled off his moleskin glove and showed him scars covered his arm halfway to the elbow and the mottled pink flesh still felt tight and tender but it was healing it itches though maester aemon says thats good he gave me a salve to take with me when we ride you can wield longclaw despite the pain well enough jon flexed his fingers opening and closing his fist the way the maester had shown him im to work the fingers every day to keep them nimble as maester aemon said blind he may be but aemon knows what hes about i pray the gods let us keep him another twenty years do you know that he might have been king jon was taken by surprise he told me his father was king but not i thought him perhaps a younger son so he was his fathers father was daeron targaryen the second of his name who brought dorne into the realm part of the pact was that he wed a dornish princess she gave him four sons aemons father maekar was the youngest of those and aemon was his third son mind you all this happened long before i was born ancient as smallwood would make me maester aemon was named for the dragonknight so he was some say prince aemon was king daerons true father not aegon the unworthy be that as it may our aemon lacked the dragonknights martial nature he likes to say he had a slow sword but quick wits small wonder his grandfather packed him off to the citadel he was nine or ten i believe and ninth or tenth in the line of succession as well maester aemon had counted more than a hundred name days jon knew frail shrunken wizened and blind it was hard to imagine him as a little boy no older than arya mormont continued aemon was at his books when the eldest of his uncles the heir apparent was slain in a tourney mishap he left two sons but they followed him to the grave not long after during the great spring sickness king daeron was also taken so the crown passed to daerons second son aerys the mad king jon was confused aerys had been king before robert that wasnt so long ago no this was aerys the first the one robert deposed was the second of that name how long ago was this eighty years or close enough the old bear said and no i still hadnt been born though aemon had page forged half a dozen links of his maesters chain by then aerys wed his own sister as the targaryens were wont to do and reigned for ten or twelve years aemon took his vows and left the citadel to serve at some lordlings court until his royal uncle died without issue the iron throne passed to the last of king daerons four sons that was maekar aemons father the new king summoned all his sons to court and would have made aemon part of his councils but he refused saying that would usurp the place rightly belonging to the grand maester instead he served at the keep of his eldest brother another daeron well that one died too leaving only a feeblewitted daughter as heir some pox he caught from a whore i believe the next brother was aerion aerion the monstrous jon knew that name the prince who thought he was a dragon was one of old nans more gruesome tales his little brother bran had loved it the very one though he named himself aerion brightflame one night in his cups he drank a jar of wildfire after telling his friends it would transform him into a dragon but the gods were kind and it transformed him into a corpse not quite a year after king maekar died in battle against an outlaw lord jon was not entirely innocent of the history of the realm his own maester had seen to that that was the year of the great council he said the lords passed over prince aerions infant son and prince daerons daughter and gave the crown to aegon yes and no first they offered it quietly to aemon and quietly he refused the gods meant for him to serve not to rule he told them he had sworn a vow and would not break it though the high septon himself offered to absolve him well no sane man wanted any blood of aerions on the throne and daerons girl was a lackwit besides being female so they had no choice but to turn to aemons younger brotheraegon the fifth of his name aegon the unlikely they called him born the fourth son of a fourth son aemon knew and rightly that if he remained at court those who disliked his brothers rule would seek to use him so he came to the wall and here he has remained while his brother and his brothers son and his son each reigned and died in turn until jaime lannister put an end to the line of the dragonkings king croaked the raven the bird flapped across the solar to land on mormonts shoulder king it said again strutting back and forth he likes that word jon said smiling an easy word to say an easy word to like king the bird said again i think he means for you to have a crown my lord the realm has three kings already and thats two too many for my liking mormont stroked the raven under the beak with a finger but all the while his eyes never left jon snow it made him feel odd my lord why have you told me this about maester aemon must i have a reason mormont shifted in his seat frowning your brother robb has been crowned king in the north you and aemon have that in common a king for a brother and this too said jon a vow page the old bear gave a loud snort and the raven took flight flapping in a circle about the room give me a man for every vow ive seen broken and the wall will never lack for defenders ive always known that robb would be lord of winterfell mormont gave a whistle and the bird flew to him again and settled on his arm a lords one thing a kings another he offered the raven a handful of corn from his pocket they will garb your brother robb in silks satins and velvets of a hundred different colors while you live and die in black ringmail he will wed some beautiful princess and father sons on her youll have no wife nor will you ever hold a child of your own blood in your arms robb will rule you will serve men will call you a crow him theyll call your grace singers will praise every little thing he does while your greatest deeds all go unsung tell me that none of this troubles you jon and ill name you a liar and know i have the truth of it jon drew himself up taut as a bowstring and if it did trouble me what might i do bastard as i am what will you do mormont asked bastard as you are be troubled said jon and keep my vows chapter catelyn her sons crown was fresh from the forge and it seemed to catelyn stark that the weight of it pressed heavy on robbs head the ancient crown of the kings of winter had been lost three centuries ago yielded up to aegon the conqueror when torrhen stark knelt in submission what aegon had done with it no man could say lord hosters smith had done his work well and robbs crown looked much as the other was said to have looked in the tales told of the stark kings of old an open circlet of hammered bronze incised with the runes of the first men surmounted by nine black iron spikes wrought in the shape of longswords of gold and silver and gemstones it had none bronze and iron were the metals of winter dark and strong to fight against the cold as they waited in riverruns great hall for the prisoner to be brought before them she saw robb push back the crown so it rested upon the thick auburn mop of his hair moments later he moved it forward again later he gave it a quarter turn as if that might make it sit more easily on his brow it is no easy thing to wear a crown catelyn thought watching especially for a boy of fifteen years when the guards brought in the captive robb called for his sword olyvar frey offered it up hilt first and her son drew the blade and laid it bare across his knees a threat plain for all to see your grace here is the man you asked for announced ser robin ryger captain of the tully household guard kneel before the king lannister theon greyjoy shouted ser robin forced the prisoner to his knees page he did not look a lion catelyn reflected this ser cleos frey was a son of the lady genna who was sister to lord tywin lannister but he had none of the fabled lannister beauty the fair hair and green eyes instead he had inherited the stringy brown locks weak chin and thin face of his sire ser emmon frey old lord walders second son his eyes were pale and watery and he could not seem to stop blinking but perhaps that was only the light the cells below riverrun were dark and damp and these days crowded as well rise ser cleos her sons voice was not as icy as his fathers would have been but he did not sound a boy of fifteen either war had made a man of him before his time morning light glimmered faintly against the edge of the steel across his knees yet it was not the sword that made ser cleos frey anxious it was the beast grey wind her son had named him a direwolf large as any elkhound lean and smokedark with eyes like molten gold when the beast padded forward and sniffed at the captive knight every man in that hall could smell the scent of fear ser cleos had been taken during the battle in the whispering wood where grey wind had ripped out the throats of half a dozen men the knight scrambled up edging away with such alacrity that some of the watchers laughed aloud thank you my lord your grace barked lord umber the greatjon ever the loudest of robbs northern bannermen and the truest and fiercest as well or so he insisted he had been the first to proclaim her son king in the north and he would brook no slight to the honor of his newmade sovereign your grace ser cleos corrected hastily pardons he is not a bold man this one catelyn thought more of a frey than a lannister in truth his cousin the kingslayer would have been a much different matter they would never have gotten that honorific through ser jaime lannisters perfect teeth i brought you from your cell to carry my message to your cousin cersei lannister in kings landing youll travel under a peace banner with thirty of my best men to escort you ser cleos was visibly relieved then i should be most glad to bring his graces message to the queen understand robb said i am not giving you your freedom your grandfather lord walder pledged me his support and that of house frey many of your cousins and uncles rode with us in the whispering wood but you chose to fight beneath the lion banner that makes you a lannister not a frey i want your pledge on your honor as a knight that after you deliver my message youll return with the queens reply and resume your captivity ser cleos answered at once i do so vow every man in this hall has heard you warned catelyns brother ser edmure tully who spoke for riverrun and the lords of the trident in the place of their dying father if you do not return the whole realm will know you forsworn i will do as i pledged ser cleos replied stiffly what is this message page an offer of peace robb stood longsword in hand grey wind moved to his side the hall grew hushed tell the queen regent that if she meets my terms i will sheath this sword and make an end to the war between us in the back of the hall catelyn glimpsed the tall gaunt figure of lord rickard karstark shove through a rank of guards and out the door no one else moved robb paid the disruption no mind olyvar the paper he commanded the squire took his longsword and handed up a rolled parchment robb unrolled it first the queen must release my sisters and provide them with transport by sea from kings landing to white harbor it is to be understood that sansas betrothal to joffrey baratheon is at an end when i receive word from my castellan that my sisters have returned unharmed to winterfell i will release the queens cousins the squire willem lannister and your brother tion frey and give them safe escort to casterly rock or wheresoever she desires them delivered catelyn stark wished she could read the thoughts that hid behind each face each furrowed brow and pair of tightened lips secondly my lord fathers bones will be returned to us so he may rest beside his brother and sister in the crypts beneath winterfell as he would have wished the remains of the men of his household guard who died in his service at kings landing must also be returned living men had gone south and cold bones would return ned had the truth of it she thought his place was at winterfell he said as much but would i hear him no go i told him you must be roberts hand for the good of our house for the sake of our children my doing mine no other third my fathers greatsword ice will be delivered to my hand here at riverrun she watched her brother ser edmure tully as he stood with his thumbs hooked over his swordbelt his face as still as stone fourth the queen will command her father lord tywin to release those knights and lords bannermen of mine that he took captive in the battle on the green fork of the trident once he does so i shall release my own captives taken in the whispering wood and the battle of the camps save jaime lannister alone who will remain my hostage for his fathers good behavior she studied theon greyjoys sly smile wondering what it meant that young man had a way of looking as though he knew some secret jest that only he was privy to catelyn had never liked it lastly king joffrey and the queen regent must renounce all claims to dominion over the north henceforth we are no part of their realm but a free and independent kingdom as of old our domain shall include all the stark lands north of the neck and in addition the lands watered by the river trident and its vassal streams bounded by the golden tooth to the west and the mountains of the moon in the east the king in the north boomed greatjon umber a hamsized fist hammering at the air as he shouted stark stark the king in the north robb rolled up the parchment again maester vyman has drawn a map showing the borders we claim you shall have a copy for the queen lord tywin must withdraw beyond these borders and cease his raiding burning and pillage the queen regent and her son shall make no claims to taxes incomes nor page service from my people and shall free my lords and knights from all oaths of fealty vows pledges debts and obligations owed to the iron throne and the houses baratheon and lanister additionally the lannisters shall deliver ten highborn hostages to be mutually agreed upon as a pledge of peace these i will treat as honored guests according to their station so long as the terms of this pact are abided with faithfully i shall release two hostages every year and return them safely to their families robb tossed the rolled parchment at the knights feet there are the terms if she meets them ill give her peace if not he whistled and grey wind moved forward snarling ill give her another whispering wood stark the greatjon roared again and now other voices took up the cry stark stark king in the north the direwolf threw back his head and howled ser cleos had gone the color of curdled milk the queen shall hear your message myyour grace good robb said ser robin see that he has a good meal and clean clothing hes to ride at first light as you command your grace ser robin ryger replied then we are done the assembled knights and lords bannermen bent their knees as robb turned to leave grey wind at his heels olyvar frey scrambled ahead to open the door catelyn followed them out her brother at her side you did well she told her son in the gallery that led from the rear of the hall though that business with the wolf was japery more befitting a boy than a king robb scratched grey wind behind the ear did you see the look on his face mother he asked smiling what i saw was lord karstark walking out as did i robb lifted off his crown with both hands and gave it to olyvar take this thing back to my bedchamber at once your grace the squire hurried off ill wager there were others who felt the same as lord karstark her brother edmure declared how can we talk of peace while the lannisters spread like a pestilence over my fathers domains stealing his crops and slaughtering his people i say again we ought to be marching on harrenhal we lack the strength robb said though unhappily edmure persisted do we grow stronger sitting here our host dwindles every day and whose doing is that catelyn snapped at her brother it had been at edmures insistence that robb had given the river lords leave to depart after his crowning each to defend his own lands ser marq piper and lord karyl vance had been the first to go lord jonos bracken had followed vowing to reclaim the burnt shell of his castle and bury his dead and now lord jason mallister had announced his intent to return to his seat at seagard still mercifully untouched by the fighting you cannot ask my river lords to remain idle while their fields are being pillaged and their people put to page the sword ser edmure said but lord karstark is a northman it would be an ill thing if he were to leave us ill speak with him said robb he lost two sons in the whispering wood who can blame him if he does not want to make peace with their killers with my fathers killers more bloodshed will not bring your father back to us or lord rickards sons catelyn said an offer had to be madethough a wiser man might have offered sweeter terms any sweeter and i would have gagged her sons beard had grown in redder than his auburn hair robb seemed to think it made him look fierce royal older but bearded or no he was still a youth of fifteen and wanted vengeance no less than rickard karstark it had been no easy thing to convince him to make even this offer poor as it was cersei lannister will never consent to trade your sisters for a pair of cousins its her brother shell want as you know full well she had told him as much before but catelyn was finding that kings do not listen half so attentively as sons i cant release the kingslayer not even if i wanted to my lords would never abide it your lords made you their king and can unmake me just as easy if your crown is the price we must pay to have arya and sansa returned safe we should pay it willingly half your lords would like to murder lannister in his cell if he should die while hes your prisoner men will say that he well deserved it robb finished and your sisters catelyn asked sharply will they deserve their deaths as well i promise you if any harm comes to her brother cersei will pay us back blood for blood lannister wont die robb said no one so much as speaks to him without my warrant he has food water clean straw more comfort than he has any right to but i wont free him not even for arya and sansa her son was looking down at her catelyn realized was it war that made him grow so fast she wondered or the crown they had put on his head are you afraid to have jaime lannister in the field again is that the truth of it grey wind growled as if he sensed robbs anger and edmure tully put a brotherly hand on catelyns shoulder cat dont the boy has the right of this dont call me the boy robb said rounding on his uncle his anger spilling out all at once on poor edmure who had only meant to support him im almost a man grown and a kingyour king ser and i dont fear jaime lannister i defeated him once ill defeat him again if i must only he pushed a fall of hair out of his eyes and gave a shake of the head i might have been able to trade the kingslayer for father but page but not for the girls her voice was icy quiet girls are not important enough are they robb made no answer but there was hurt in his eyes blue eyes tully eyes eyes she had given him she had wounded him but he was too much his fathers son to admit it that was unworthy of me she told herself gods be good what is to become of me he is doing his best trying so hard i know it i see it and yet i have lost my ned the rock my life was built on i could not bear to lose the girls as well ill do all i can for my sisters robb said if the queen has any sense shell accept my terms if not ill make her rue the day she refused me plainly hed had enough of the subject mother are you certain you will not consent to go to the twins you would be farther from the fighting and you could acquaint yourself with lord freys daughters to help me choose my bride when the war is done he wants me gone catelyn thought wearily kings are not supposed to have mothers it would seem and i tell him things he does not want to hear youre old enough to decide which of lord walders girls you prefer without your mothers help robb then go with theon he leaves on the morrow hell help the mallisters escort that lot of captives to seagard and then take ship for the iron islands you could find a ship as well and be back at winterfell with a moons turn if the winds are kind bran and rickon need you and you do not is that what you mean to say my lord father has little enough time remaining him so long as your grandfather lives my place is at riverrun with him i could command you to go as king i could catelyn ignored that ill say again i would sooner you sent someone else to pyke and kept theon close to you who better to treat with balon greyjoy than his son jason mallister offered catelyn tytos blackwood stevron frey anyone but not theon her son squatted beside grey wind ruffling the wolfs fur and incidentally avoiding her eyes theons fought bravely for us i told you how he saved bran from those wildlings in the wolfswood if the lannisters wont make peace ill have need of lord greyjoys longships youll have them sooner if you keep his son as hostage hes been a hostage half his life for good reason catelyn said balon greyjoy is not a man to be trusted he wore a crown himself remember if only for a season he may aspire to wear one again robb stood i will not grudge him that if im king in the north let him be king of the iron islands if thats his desire ill give him a crown gladly so long as he helps us bring down the lannisters robb page im sending theon good day mother grey wind come robb walked off briskly the direwolf padding beside him catelyn could only watch him go her son and now her king how queer that felt command she had told him back in moat cailin and so he did i am going to visit father she announced abruptly come with me edmure i need to have a word with those new bowmen ser desmond is training ill visit him later if he still lives catelyn thought but she said nothing her brother would sooner face battle than that sickroom the shortest way to the central keep where her father lay dying was through the godswood with its grass and wildflowers and thick stands of elm and redwood a wealth of rustling leaves still clung to the branches of the trees all ignorant of the word the white raven had brought to riverrun a fortnight past autumn had come the conclave had declared but the gods had not seen fit to tell the winds and woods as yet for that catelyn was duly grateful autumn was always a fearful time with the specter of winter looming ahead even the wisest man never knew whether his next harvest would be the last hoster tully lord of riverrun lay abed in his solar with its commanding view to the east where the rivers tumblestone and red fork met beyond the walls of his castle he was sleeping when catelyn entered his hair and beard as white as his featherbed his once portly frame turned small and frail by the death that grew within him beside the bed still dressed in mail hauberk and travelstained cloak sat her fathers brother the blackfish his boots were dusty and spattered with dried mud does robb know you are returned uncle ser brynden tully was robbs eyes and ears the commander of his scouts and outriders no i came here straight from the stables when they told me the king was holding court his grace will want to hear my tidings in private first id think the blackfish was a tall lean man grey of hair and precise in his movements his cleanshaven face lined and windburnt how is he he asked and she knew he did not mean robb much the same the maester gives him drearnwine and milk of the poppy for his pain so he sleeps most of the time and eats too little he seems weaker with each day that passes does he speak yes but there is less and less sense to the things he says he talks of his regrets of unfinished tasks of people long dead and times long past sometimes he does not know what season it is or who i am once he called me by mothers name he misses her still ser brynden answered you have her face i can see it in your cheekbones and your jaw you remember more of her than i do it has been a long time she seated herself on the bed and brushed away a strand of fine white hair that had fallen across her fathers face each time i ride out i wonder if i shall find him alive or dead on my return despite their quarrels there was a deep bond between her father and the brother he had once disowned page at least you made your peace with him they sat for a time in silence until catelyn raised her head you spoke of tidings that robb needed to hear lord hoster moaned and rolled onto his side almost as if he had heard brynden stood come outside best if we do not wake him she followed him out onto the stone balcony that jutted threesided from the solar like the prow of a ship her uncle glanced up frowning you can see it by day now my men call it the red messenger but what is the message catelyn raised her eyes to where the faint red line of the comet traced a path across the deep blue sky like a long scratch across the face of god the greatjon told robb that the old gods have unfurled a red flag of vengeance for ned edmure thinks its an omen of victory for riverrunhe sees a fish with a long tail in the tully colors red against blue she sighed i wish i had their faith crimson is a lannister color that things not crimson ser brynden said nor tully red the mud red of the river thats blood up there child smeared across the sky our blood or theirs was there ever a war where only one side bled her uncle gave a shake of the head the riverlands are awash in blood and flame all around the gods eye the fighting has spread south to the blackwater and north across the trident almost to the twins marq piper and karyl vance have won some small victories and this southron lordling beric dondarrion has been raiding the raiders falling upon lord tywins foraging parties and vanishing back into the woods its said that ser burton crakehall was boasting that hed slain dondarrion until he led his column into one of lord berics traps and got every man of them killed some of neds guard from kings landing are with this lord beric catelyn recalled may the gods preserve them dondarrion and this red priest who rides with him are clever enough to preserve themselves if the tales be true her uncle said but your fathers bannermen make a sadder tale robb should never have let them go theyve scattered like quail each man trying to protect his own and its folly cat folly jonos bracken was wounded in the fighting amidst the ruins of his castle and his nephew hendry slain tytos blackwoods swept the lannisters off his lands but they took every cow and pig and speck of grain and left him nothing to defend but raventree hall and a scorched desert darry men recaptured their lords keep but held it less than a fortnight before gregor clegane descended on them and put the whole garrison to the sword even their lord catelyn was horrorstruck darry was only a child aye and the last of his line as well the boy would have brought a fine ransom but what does gold mean to a frothing dog like gregor clegane that beasts head would make a noble gift for all the people of the realm i vow catelyn knew ser gregors evil reputation yet still dont speak to me of heads uncle cersei has mounted neds on a spike above the walls of the red keep and left it for the crows and flies even page now it was hard for her to believe that he was truly gone some nights she would wake in darkness halfasleep and for an instant expect to find him there beside her clegane is no more than lord tywins catspaw for tywin lannisterlord of casterly rock warden of the west father to queen cersei ser jaime the kingslayer and tyrion the imp and grandfather to joffrey baratheon the newcrowned boy kingwas the true danger catelyn believed true enough ser brynden admitted and tywin lannister is no mans fool he sits safe behind the walls of harrenhal feeding his host on our harvest and burning what he does not take gregor is not the only dog hes loosed ser amory lorch is in the field as well and some sellsword out of qohor whod sooner maim a man than kill him ive seen what they leave behind them whole villages put to the torch women raped and mutilated butchered children left unburied to draw wolves and wild dogs it would sicken even the dead when edmure hears this he will rage and that will be just as lord tywin desires even terror has its purpose cat lannister wants to provoke us to battle robb is like to give him that wish catelyn said fretful he is restless as a cat sitting here and edmure and the greatjon and the others will urge him on her son had won two great victories smashing jaime lannister in the whispering wood and routing his leaderless host outside the walls of riverrun in the battle of the camps but from the way some of his bannermen spoke of him he might have been aegon the conqueror reborn brynden blackfish arched a bushy grey eyebrow more fool they my first rule of war catnever give the enemy his wish lord tywin would like to fight on a field of his own choosing he wants us to march on harrenhal harrenhal every child of the trident knew the tales told of harrenhal the vast fortress that king harren the black had raised beside the waters of gods eye three hundred years past when the seven kingdoms had been seven kingdoms and the riverlands were ruled by the ironmen from the islands in his pride harren had desired the highest hall and tallest towers in all westeros forty years it had taken rising like a great shadow on the shore of the lake while harrens armies plundered his neighbors for stone lumber gold and workers thousands of captives died in his quarries chained to his sledges or laboring on his five colossal towers men froze by winter and sweltered in summer weirwoods that had stood three thousand years were cut down for beams and rafters harren had beggared the riverlands and the iron islands alike to ornament his dream and when at last harrenhal stood complete on the very day king harren took up residence aegon the conqueror had come ashore at kings landing catelyn could remember hearing old nan tell the story to her own children back at winterfell and king harren learned that thick walls and high towers are small use against dragons the tale always ended for dragons fly harren and all his line had perished in the fires that engulfed his monstrous fortress and every house that held harrenhal since had come to misfortune strong it might be but it was a dark place and cursed i would not have robb fight a battle in the shadow of that keep catelyn admitted yet we must do something uncle and soon her uncle agreed i have not told you the worst of it child the men i sent west have page brought back word that a new host is gathering at casterly rock another lannister army the thought made her ill robb must be told at once who will command ser stafford lannister its said he turned to gaze out over the rivers his redandblue cloak stirring in the breeze another nephew the lannisters of casterly rock were a damnably large and fertile house cousin ser brynden corrected brother to lord tywins late wife so twice related an old man and a bit of a dullard but he has a son ser daven who is more formidable then let us hope it is the father and not the son who takes this army into the field we have some time yet before we must face them this lot will be sellswords freeriders and green boys from the stews of lannisport ser stafford must see that they are armed and drilled before he dare risk battle and make no mistake lord tywin is not the kingslayer he will not rush in heedless he will wait patiently for ser stafford to march before he stirs from behind the walls of harrenhal unless said catelyn yes ser brynden prompted unless he must leave harrenhal she said to face some other threat her uncle looked at her thoughtfully lord renly king renly if she would ask help from the man she would need to grant him the style he had claimed for himself perhaps the blackfish smiled a dangerous smile hell want something though hell want what kings always want she said homage chapter tyrion janos slynt was a butchers son and he laughed like a man chopping meat more wine tyrion asked him i should not object lord janos said holding out his cup he was built like a keg and had a similar capacity i should not object at all thats a fine red from the arbor dornish tyrion gestured and his serving man poured but for the servants he and lord janos were alone in the small hall at a small candlelit table surrounded by darkness quite the find dornish wines are not often so rich page rich said the big frogfaced man taking a healthy gulp he was not a man for sipping janos slynt tyrion had made note of that at once yes rich thats the very word i was searching for the very word you have a gift for words lord tyrion if i might say so and you tell a droll tale droll yes im pleased you think so but im not a lord as you are a simple tyrion will suffice for me lord janos as you wish he took another swallow dribbling wine on the front of his black satin doublet he was wearing a clothofgold half cape fastened with a miniature spear its point enameled in dark red and he was well and truly drunk tyrion covered his mouth and belched politely unlike lord janos he had gone easy on the wine but he was very full the first thing he had done after taking up residence in the tower of the hand was inquire after the finest cook in the city and take her into his service this evening they had supped on oxtail soup summer greens tossed with pecans grapes red fennel and crumbled cheese hot crab pie spiced squash and quails drowned in butter each dish had come with its own wine lord janos allowed that he had never eaten half so well no doubt that will change when you take your seat in harrenhal tyrion said for a certainty perhaps i should ask this cook of yours to enter my service what do you say wars have been fought over less he said and they both had a good long laugh youre a bold man to take harrenhal for your seat such a grim place and huge costly to maintain and some say cursed as well should i fear a pile of stone he hooted at the notion a bold man you said you must be bold to rise as i have to harrenhal yes and why not you know you are a bold man too i sense small mayhap but bold you are too kind more wine no no truly i oh gods be damned yes why not a bold man drinks his fill truly tyrion filled lord slynts cup to the brim i have been glancing over the names you put forward to take your place as commander of the city watch good men fine men any of the six will do but id choose allar deem my right arm good good man loyal pick him and you wont be sorry if he pleases the king to be sure tyrion took a small sip of his own wine i had been considering ser jacelyn bywater hes been captain on the mud gate for three years and he served with valor during balon greyjoys rebellion king robert knighted him at pyke and yet his name does not appear on your list lord janos slynt took a gulp of wine and sloshed it around in his mouth for a moment before swallowing bywater well brave man to be sure yet hes rigid that one a queer dog the men dont like him a cripple too lost his hand at pyke thats what got him knighted a poor trade if you ask me a hand for a ser he laughed ser jacelyn thinks overmuch of himself and his honor as i see it youll do better leaving that one where he is my lortyrion allar deems the man for you page deem is little loved in the streets i am told hes feared thats better what was it i heard of him some trouble in a brothel that not his fault my lortyrion no he never meant to kill the woman that was her own doing he warned her to stand aside and let him do his duty still mothers and children he might have expected shed try to save the babe tyrion smiled have some of this cheese it goes splendidly with the wine tell me why did you choose deem for that unhappy task a good commander knows his men tyrion some are good for one job some for another doing for a babe and her still on the tit that takes a certain sort not every mand do it even if it was only some whore and her whelp i suppose thats so said tyrion hearing only some whore and thinking of shae and tysha long ago and all the other women who had taken his coin and his seed over the years slynt went on oblivious a hard man for a hard job is deem does as hes told and never a word afterward he cut a slice off the cheese this is fine sharp give me a good sharp knife and a good sharp cheese and im a happy man tyrion shrugged enjoy it while you can with the riverlands in flame and renly king in highgarden good cheese will soon be hard to come by so who sent you after the whores bastard lord janos gave tyrion a wary look then laughed and wagged a wedge of cheese at him youre a sly one tyrion thought you could trick me did you it takes more than wine and cheese to make janos slynt tell more than he should i pride myself never a question and never a word afterward not with me as with deem just the same you make him your commander when im off to harrenhal and you wont regret it tyrion broke off a nibble of the cheese it was sharp indeed and veined with wine very choice whoever the king names will not have an easy time stepping into your armor i can tell lord mormont faces the same problem lord janos looked puzzled i thought she was a lady mormont beds down with bears thats the one it was her brother i was speaking of jeor mormont the lord commander of the nights watch when i was visiting with him on the wall he mentioned how concerned he was about finding a good man to take his place the watch gets so few good men these days tyrion grinned hed sleep easier if he had a man like you i imagine or the valiant allar deem lord janos roared small chance of that page one would think tyrion said but life does take queer turns consider eddard stark my lord i dont suppose he ever imagined his life would end on the steps of baelors sept there were damn few as did lord janos allowed chuckling tyrion chuckled too a pity i wasnt here to see it they say even varys was surprised lord janos laughed so hard his gut shook the spider he said knows everything they say well he didnt know that how could he tyrion put the first hint of a chill in his tone he had helped persuade my sister that stark should be pardoned on the condition that he take the black eh janos slynt blinked vaguely at tyrion my sister cersei tyrion repeated a shade more strongly in case the fool had some doubt who he meant the queen regent yes slynt took a swallow as to that well the king commanded it mlord the king himself the king is thirteen tyrion reminded him still he is the king slynts jowls quivered when he frowned the lord of the seven kingdoms well one or two of them at least tyrion said with a sour smile might i have a look at your spear my spear lord janos blinked in confusion tyrion pointed the clasp that fastens your cape hesitantly lord janos drew out the ornament and handed it to tyrion we have goldsmiths in lannisport who do better workhe opined the red enamel blood is a shade much if you dont mind my saying tell me my lord did you drive the spear into the mans back yourself or did you only give the command i gave the command and id give it again lord stark was a traitor the bald spot in the middle of slynts head was beetred and his clothofgold cape had slithered off his shoulders onto the floor the man tried to buy me little dreaming that you had already been sold slynt slammed down his wine cup are you drunk if you think i will sit here and have my honor questioned what honor is that i do admit you made a better bargain than ser jacelyn a lordship and a castle for a spear thrust in the back and you didnt even need to thrust the spear he tossed the golden ornament back to janos slynt it bounced off his chest and clattered to the floor as the man rose i mislike the tone of your voice my loimp i am the lord of har page renhal and a member of the kings council who are you to chastise me like this tyrion cocked his head sideways i think you know quite well who i am how many sons do you have what are my sons to you dwarf dwarf his anger flashed you should have stopped at imp i am tyrion of house lannister and someday if you have the sense the gods gave a sea slug you will drop to your knees in thanks that it was me you had to deal with and not my lord father now how many sons do you have tyrion could see the sudden fear in janos slynts eyes ththree mlord and a daughter please mlord you need not beg he slid off his chair you have my word no harm will come to them the younger boys will be fostered out as squires if they serve well and loyally they may be knights in time let it never be said that house lannister does not reward those who serve it your eldest son will inherit the title lord slynt and this appalling sigil of yours he kicked at the little golden spear and sent it skittering across the floor lands will be found for him and he can build a seat for himself it will not be harrenhal but it will be sufficient it will be up to him to make a marriage for the girl janos slynts face had gone from red to white whwhat what do you his jowls were quivering like mounds of suet what do i mean to do with you tyrion let the oaf tremble for a moment before he answered the carrack summers dream sails on the morning tide her master tells me she will call at gulltown the three sisters the isle of skagos and eastwatchbythesea when you see lord commander mormont give him my fond regards and tell him that i have not forgotten the needs of the nights watch i wish you long life and good service my lord once janos slynt realized he was not to be summarily executed color returned to his face he thrust his jaw out we will see about this imp dwarf perhaps it will be you on that ship what do you think of that perhaps it will be you on the wall he gave a bark of anxious laughter you and your threats well we will see i am the kings friend you know we shall hear what joffrey has to say about this and littlefinger and the queen oh yes janos slynt has a good many friends we will see who goes sailing i promise you indeed we will slynt spun on his heel like the watchman hed once been and strode the length of the small hall boots ringing on the stone he clattered up the steps threw open the door and came facetoface with a tall lanternjawed man in black breastplate and gold cloak strapped to the stump of his right wrist was an iron hand janos he said deepset eyes glinting under a prominent brow ridge and a shock of saltandpepper hair six gold cloaks moved quietly into the small hall behind him as janos slynt backed away lord slynt tyrion called out i believe you know ser jacelyn bywater our new commander of the city watch we have a litter waiting for you my lord ser jacelyn told slynt the docks are dark and distant and the streets are not safe by night men page as the gold cloaks ushered out their onetime commander tyrion called ser jacelyn to his side and handed him a roll of parchment its a long voyage and lord slynt will want for company see that these six join him on the summers dream bywater glanced over the names and smiled as you will theres one tyrion said quietly deem tell the captain it would not be taken amiss if that one should happen to be swept overboard before they reach eastwatch im told those northern waters are very stormy my lord ser jacelyn bowed and took his leave his cloak rippling behind him he trod on slynts clothofgold cape on his way tyrion sat alone sipping at what remained of the fine sweet dornish wine servants came and went clearing the dishes from the table he told them to leave the wine when they were done varys came gliding into the hall wearing flowing lavender robes that matched his smell oh sweetly done my good lord then why do i have this bitter taste in my mouth he pressed his fingers into his temples i told them to throw allar deem into the sea i am sorely tempted to do the same with you you might be disappointed by the result varys replied the storms come and go the waves crash overhead the big fish eat the little fish and i keep on paddling might i trouble you for a taste of the wine that lord slynt enjoyed so much tyrion waved at the flagon frowning varys filled a cup ah sweet as summer he took another sip i hear the grapes singing on my tongue i wondered what that noise was tell the grapes to keep still my head is about to split it was my sister that was what the ohsoloyal lord janos refused to say cersei sent the gold cloaks to that brothel varys tittered nervously so he had known all along you left that part out tyrion said accusingly your own sweet sister varys said so griefstricken he looked close to tears it is a hard thing to tell a man my lord i was fearful how you might take it can you forgive me no tyrion snapped damn you damn her he could not touch cersei he knew not yet not even if hed wanted to and he was far from certain that he did yet it rankled to sit here and make a mummers show of justice by punishing the sorry likes of janos slynt and allar deem while his sister continued on her savage course in future you will tell me what you know lord varys all of what you know the eunuchs smile was sly that might take rather a long time my good lord i know quite a lot not enough to save this child it would seem alas no there was another bastard a boy older i took steps to see him removed from harms way but i confess i never dreamed the babe would be at risk a baseborn girl less than a year old with a page whore for a mother what threat could she pose she was roberts tyrion said bitterly that was enough for cersei it would seem yes it is grievous sad i must blame myself for the poor sweet babe and her mother who was so young and loved the king did she tyrion had never seen the dead girls face but in his mind she was shae and tysha both can a whore truly love anyone i wonder no dont answer some things i would rather not know he had settled shae in a sprawling stoneandtimber manse with its own well and stable and garden he had given her servants to see to her wants a white bird from the summer isles to keep her company silks and silver and gemstones to adorn her guards to protect her and yet she seemed restive she wanted to be with him more she told him she wanted to serve him and help him you help me most here between the sheets he told her one night after their loving as he lay beside her his head pillowed against her breast his groin aching with a sweet soreness she made no reply save with her eyes he could see there that it was not what shed wanted to hear sighing tyrion started to reach for the wine again then remembered lord janos and pushed the flagon away it does seem my sister was telling the truth about starks death we have my nephew to thank for that madness king joffrey gave the command janos slynt and ser ilyn payne carried it out swiftly without hesitation almost as if they had expected it yes we have been over this ground before without profit a folly with the city watch in hand my lord you are well placed to see to it that his grace commits no further follies to be sure there is still the queens household guard to consider the red cloaks tyrion shrugged vylarrs loyalty is to casterly rock he knows i am here with my fathers authority cersei would find it hard to use his men against me besides they are only a hundred i have half again as many men of my own and six thousand gold cloaks if bywater is the man you claim you will find ser jacelyn to be courageous honorable obedient and most grateful to whom i wonder tyrion did not trust varys though there was no denying his value he knew things beyond a doubt why are you so helpful my lord varys he asked studying the mans soft hands the bald powdered face the slimy little smile you are the hand i serve the realm the king and you as you served jon arryn and eddard stark i served lord arryn and lord stark as best i could i was saddened and horrified by their most untimely deaths think how i feel im like to be next page oh i think not varys said swirling the wine in his cup power is a curious thing my lord perchance you have considered the riddle i posed you that day in the inn it has crossed my mind a time or two tyrion admitted the king the priest the rich manwho lives and who dies who will the swordsman obey its a riddle without an answer or rather too many answers all depends on the man with the sword and yet he is no one varys said he has neither crown nor gold nor favor of the gods only a piece of pointed steel that piece of steel is the power of life and death just so yet if it is the swordsmen who rule us in truth why do we pretend our kings hold the power why should a strong man with a sword ever obey a child king like joffrey or a winesodden oaf like his father because these child kings and drunken oafs can call other strong men with other swords then these other swordsmen have the true power or do they whence came their swords why do they obey varys smiled some say knowledge is power some tell us that all power comes from the gods others say it derives from law yet that day on the steps of baelors sept our godly high septon and the lawful queen regent and your eversoknowledgeable servant were as powerless as any cobbler or cooper in the crowd who truly killed eddard stark do you think joffrey who gave the command ser ilyn payne who swung the sword or another tyrion cocked his head sideways did you mean to answer your damned riddle or only to make my head ache worse varys smiled here then power resides where men believe it resides no more and no less so power is a mummers trick a shadow on the wall varys murmured yet shadows can kill and ofttimes a very small man can cast a very large shadow tyrion smiled lord varys i am growing strangely fond of you i may kill you yet but i think id feel sad about it i will take that as high praise what are you varys tyrion found he truly wanted to know a spider they say spies and informers are seldom loved my lord i am but a loyal servant of the realm and a eunuch let us not forget that i seldom do people have called me a halfman too yet i think the gods have been kinder to me i am small my legs are twisted and women do not look upon me with any great yearning yet im still a man shae is not the first to grace my bed and one day i may take a wife and sire a son if the gods are good hell look page like his uncle and think like his father you have no such hope to sustain you dwarfs are a jape of the gods but men make eunuchs who cut you varys when and why who are you truly the eunuchs smile never flickered but his eyes glittered with something that was not laughter you are kind to ask my lord but my tale is long and sad and we have treasons to discuss he drew a parchment from the sleeve of his robe the master of the kings galley white hart plots to slip anchor three days hence to offer his sword and ship to lord stannis tyrion sighed i suppose we must make some sort of bloody lesson out of the man ser jacelyn could arrange for him to vanish but a trial before the king would help assure the continued loyalty of the other captains and keep my royal nephew occupied as well as you say put him down for a dose of joffreys justice varys made a mark on the parchment ser horas and ser hobber redwyne have bribed a guard to let them out a postern gate the night after next arrangements have been made for them to sail on the pentoshi galley moonrunner disguised as oarsmen can we keep them on those oars for a few years see how they fancy it he smiled no my sister would be distraught to lose such treasured guests inform ser jacelyn seize the man they bribed and explain what an honor it is to serve as a brother of the nights watch and have men posted around the moonrunner in case the redwynes find a second guard short of coin as you will another mark on the parchment your man timett slew a winesellers son this evening at a gambling den on the street of silver he accused him of cheating at tiles was it true oh beyond a doubt then the honest men of the city owe timett a debt of gratitude i shall see that he has the kings thanks the eunuch gave a nervous giggle and made another mark we also have a sudden plague of holy men the comet has brought forth all manner of queer priests preachers and prophets it would seem they beg in the winesinks and potshops and foretell doom and destruction to anyone who stops to listen tyrion shrugged we are close on the three hundredth year since aegons landing i suppose it is only to be expected let them rant they are spreading fear my lord i thought that was your job varys covered his mouth with his hand you are very cruel to say so one last matter lady tanda gave a small supper last night i have the menu and the guest list for your inspection when the wine was poured lord gyles rose to lift a cup to the king and ser balon swann was heard to remark well need three cups for thatmany laughed page tyrion raised a hand enough ser balon made a jest i am not interested in treasonous table talk lord varys you are as wise as you are gentle my lord the parchment vanished up the eunuchs sleeve we both have much to do i shall leave you when the eunuch had departed tyrion sat for a long time watching the candle and wondering how his sister would take the news of janos slynts dismissal not happily if he was any judge but beyond sending an angry protest to lord tywin in harrenhal he did not see what cersei could hope to do about it tyrion had the city watch now plus a hundredandahalf fierce clansmen and a growing force of sellswords recruited by bronn he would seem well protected doubtless eddard stark thought the same the red keep was dark and still when tyrion left the small hall bronn was waiting in his solar slynt he asked lord janos will be sailing for the wall on the morning tide varys would have me believe that i have replaced one of joffreys men with one of my own more likely i have replaced littlefingers man with one belonging to varys but so be it youd best know timett killed a man varys told me the sellsword seemed unsurprised the fool figured a oneeyed man would be easier to cheat timett pinned his wrist to the table with a dagger and ripped out his throat barehanded he has this trick where he stiffens his fingers spare me the grisly details my supper is sitting badly in my belly tyrion said how goes your recruiting well enough three new men tonight how do you know which ones to hire i look them over i question them to learn where theyve fought and how well they lie bronn smiled and then i give them a chance to kill me while i do the same for them have you killed any no one we could have used and if one of them kills you hell be one youll want to hire tyrion was a little drunk and very tired tell me bronn if i told you to kill a babe an infant girl say still at her mothers breast would you do it without question page without question no the sellsword rubbed thumb and forefinger together id ask how much and why would i ever need your allar deem lord slynt tyrion thought i have a hundred of my own he wanted to laugh he wanted to weep most of all he wanted shae chapter arya the road was little more than two ruts through the weeds the good part was with so little traffic thered be no one to point the finger and say which way theyd gone the human flood that had flowed down the kingsroad was only a trickle here the bad part was the road wound back and forth like a snake tangling with even smaller trails and sometimes seeming to vanish entirely only to reappear half a league farther on when they had all but given up hope arya hated it the land was gentle enough rolling hills and terraced fields interspersed with meadows and woodlands and little valleys where willows crowded close to slow shallow streams even so the path was so narrow and crooked that their pace had dropped to a crawl it was the wagons that slowed them lumbering along axles creaking under the weight of their heavy loads a dozen times a day they had to stop to free a wheel that had stuck in a rut or double up the teams to climb a muddy slope once in the middle of a dense stand of oak they came facetoface with three men pulling a load of firewood in an ox cart with no way for either to get around there had been nothing for it but to wait while the foresters unhitched their ox led him through the trees spun the cart hitched the ox up again and started back the way theyd come the ox was even slower than the wagons so that day they hardly got anywhere at all arya could not help looking over her shoulder wondering when the gold cloaks would catch them at night she woke at every noise to grab for needles hilt they never made camp without putting out sentries now but arya did not trust them especially the orphan boys they might have done well enough in the alleys of kings landing but out here they were lost when she was being quiet as a shadow she could sneak past all of them flitting out by starlight to make her water in the woods where no one would see once when lommy greenhands had the watch she shimmied up an oak and moved from tree to tree until she was right above his head and he never saw a thing she would have jumped down on top of him but she knew his scream would wake the whole camp and yoren might take a stick to her again lommy and the other orphans all treated the bull like someone special now because the queen wanted his head though he would have none of it i never did nothing to no queen he said angrily i did my work is all bellows and tongs and fetch and carry i was sposed to be an armorer and one day master mott says i got to join the nights watch thats all i know then hed go off to polish his helm it was a beautiful helm rounded and curved with a slit visor and two great metal bulls horns arya would watch him polish the metal with an oilcloth shining it so bright you could see the flames of the cookfire reflected in the steel yet he never actually put it on his head page i bet hes that traitors bastard lommy said one night in a hushed voice so gendry would not hear the wolf lord the one they nicked on baelors steps he is not arya declared my father only had one bastard and thats ion she stalked off into the trees wishing she could just saddle her horse and ride home she was a good horse a chestnut mare with a white blaze on her forehead and arya had always been a good rider she could gallop off and never see any of them unless she wanted to only then shed have no one to scout ahead of her or watch behind or stand guard while she napped and when the gold cloaks caught her shed be all alone it was safer to stay with yoren and the others were not far from gods eye the black brother said one morning the kingsroad wont be safe till were across the trident so well come up around the lake along the western shore theyre not like to look for us there at the next spot where two ruts cut cross each other he turned the wagons west here farmland gave way to forest the villages and holdfasts were smaller and farther apart the hills higher and the valleys deeper food grew harder to come by in the city yoren had loaded up the wagons with salt fish hard bread lard turnips sacks of beans and barley and wheels of yellow cheese but every bite of it had been eaten forced to live off the land yoren turned to koss and kurz whod been taken as poachers he would send them ahead of the column into the woods and come dusk they would be back with a deer slung between them on a pole or a brace of quail swinging from their belts the younger boys would be set to picking blackberries along the road or climbing fences to fill a sack with apples if they happened upon an orchard arya was a skilled climber and a fast picker and she liked to go off by herself one day she came across a rabbit purely by happenstance it was brown and fat with long ears and a twitchy nose rabbits ran faster than cats but they couldnt climb trees half so well she whacked it with her stick and grabbed it by its ears and yoren stewed it with some mushrooms and wild onions arya was given a whole leg since it was her rabbit she shared it with gendry the rest of them each got a spoonful even the three in manacles jaqen hghar thanked her politely for the treat and biter licked the grease off his dirty fingers with a blissful look but rorge the noseless one only laughed and said theres a hunter now lumpyface lumpyhead rabbitkiller outside a holdfast called briarwhite some fieldhands surrounded them in a cornfield demanding coin for the ears theyd taken yoren eyed their scythes and tossed them a few coppers time was a man in black was feasted from dorne to winterfell and even high lords called it an honor to shelter him under their roofs he said bitterly now cravens like you want hard coin for a bite of wormy apple he spat its sweetcorn bettern a stinking old black bird like you deserves one of them answered roughly you get out of our field now and take these sneaks and stabbers with you or well stake you up in the corn to scare the other crows away they roasted the sweetcorn in the husk that night turning the ears with long forked sticks and ate it hot right off the cob arya thought it tasted wonderful but yoren was too angry to eat a cloud seemed to hang over him ragged and black as his cloak he paced about the camp restlessly muttering to himself the next day koss came racing back to warn yoren of a camp ahead twenty or thirty men in mail and halfhelms he said some of them are cut up bad and ones dying from the sound of him with all the noise he was making i got right up close they got spears and shields but only one horse and thats lame i think they been there awhile from the stink of the place page see a banner spotted treecat yellow and black on a mudbrown field yoren folded a sourleaf into his mouth and chewed cant say he admitted might be one side might be tother if theyre hurt that bad likely theyd take our mounts no matter who they are might be theyd take more than that i believe well go wide around them it took them miles out of their way and cost them two days at the least but the old man said it was cheap at the price youll have time enough on the wall the rest o your lives most like seems to me theres no rush to get there arya saw men guarding the fields more and more when they turned north again often they stood silently beside the road giving a cold eye to anyone who passed elsewhere they patrolled on horses riding their fence lines with axes strapped to their saddles at one place she spotted a man perched up in a dead tree with a bow in his hand and a quiver hanging from the branch beside him the moment he spied them he notched an arrow to his bowstring and never looked away until the last wagon was out of sight all the while yoren cursed him in his tree lets see how well he likes it up there when the others come to take him hell scream for the watch then that he will a day later dobber spied a red glow against the evening sky either this road went and turned again or that suns setting in the north yoren climbed a rise to get a better look fire he announced he licked a thumb and held it up wind should blow it away from us still bears watching and watch it they did as the world darkened the fire seemed to grow brighter and brighter until it looked as though the whole north was ablaze from time to time they could even smell the smoke though the wind held steady and the flames never got any closer by dawn the fire had burned itself out but none of them slept very well that night it was midday when they arrived at the place where the village had been the fields were a charred desolation for miles around the houses blackened shells the carcasses of burnt and butchered animals dotted the ground under living blankets of carrion crows that rose cawing furiously when disturbed smoke still drifted from inside the holdfast its timber palisade looked strong from afar but had not proved strong enough riding out in front of the wagons on her horse arya saw burnt bodies impaled on sharpened stakes atop the walls their hands drawn up tight in front of their faces as if to fight off the flames that had consumed them yoren called a halt when they were still some distance off and told arya and the other boys to guard the wagons while he and murch and cutjack went in on foot a flock of ravens rose from inside the walls when they climbed through the broken gate and the caged ravens in their wagons called out to them with quorks and raucous shrieks should we go in after them arya asked gendry after yoren and the others had been gone a long time yoren said wait gendrys voice sounded hollow when arya turned to look she saw that he was wearing his helm all shiny steel and great curving horns page when they finally returned yoren had a little girl in his arms and murch and cutjack were carrying a woman in a sling made of an old torn quilt the girl was no older than two and she cried all the time a whimpery sound like something was caught in her throat either she couldnt talk yet or she had forgotten how the womans right arm ended in a bloody stump at her elbow and her eyes didnt seem to see anything even when she was looking right at it she talked but she only said one thing please she cried over and over please please rorge thought that was funny he laughed through the hole in his face where his nose had been and biter started laughing too until murch cursed them and told them to shut up yoren had them fix the woman a place in the back of a wagon and be quick about it he said come dark therell be wolves here and worse im scared hot pie murmured when he saw the onearmed woman thrashing in the wagon me too arya confessed he squeezed her shoulder i never truly kicked no boy to death arry i just sold my mommys pies is all arya rode as far ahead of the wagons as she dared so she wouldnt have to hear the little girl crying or listen to the woman whisper please she remembered a story old nan had told once about a man imprisoned in a dark castle by evil giants he was very brave and smart and he tricked the giants and escaped but no sooner was he outside the castle than the others took him and drank his hot red blood now she knew how he must have felt the onearmed woman died at evenfall gendry and cutjack dug her grave on a hillside beneath a weeping willow when the wind blew arya thought she could hear the long trailing branches whispering please please please the little hairs on the back of her neck rose and she almost ran from the graveside no fire tonight yoren told them supper was a handful of wild radishes koss found a cup of dry beans water from a nearby brook the water had a funny taste to it and lommy told them it was the taste of bodies rotting someplace upstream hot pie would have hit him if old reysen hadnt pulled them apart arya drank too much water just to fill her belly with something she never thought shed be able to sleep yet somehow she did when she woke it was pitchblack and her bladder was full to bursting sleepers huddled all around her wrapped in blankets and cloaks arya found needle stood listened she heard the soft footfalls of a sentry men turning in restless sleep rorges rattling snores and the queer hissing sound that biter made when he slept from a different wagon came the steady rhythmic scrape of steel on stone as yoren sat chewing sourleaf and sharpening the edge of his dirk hot pie was one of the boys on watch where you going he asked when he saw arya heading for the trees arya waved vaguely at the woods no youre not hot pie said he had gotten bolder again now that he had a sword on his belt even though it was just a shortsword and he handled it like a cleaver the old man said for everyone to stay page close tonight i need to make water arya explained well use that tree right there he pointed you dont know whats out there arry i heard wolves before yoren wouldnt like it if she fought with him she tried to look afraid wolves for true i heard he assured her i dont think i need to go after all she went back to her blanket and pretended to sleep until she heard hot pies footsteps going away then she rolled over and slipped off into the woods on the other side of the camp quiet as a shadow there were sentries out this way too but arya had no trouble avoiding them just to make sure she went out twice as far as usual when she was sure there was no one near she skinned down her breeches and squatted to do her business she was making water her clothing tangled about her ankles when she heard rustling from under the trees hot pie she thought in panic he followed me then she saw the eyes shining out from the wood bright with reflected moonlight her belly clenched tight as she grabbed for needle not caring if she pissed herself counting eyes two four eight twelve a whole pack one of them came padding out from under the trees he stared at her and bared his teeth and all she could think was how stupid shed been and how hot pie would gloat when they found her halfeaten body the next morning but the wolf turned and raced back into the darkness and quick as that the eyes were gone trembling she cleaned herself and laced up and followed a distant scraping sound back to camp and to yoren arya climbed up into the wagon beside him shaken wolves she whispered hoarsely in the woods aye they would be he never looked at her they scared me did they he spat seems to me your kind was fond o wolves nymeria was a direwolf arya hugged herself thats different anyhow shes gone jory and i threw rocks at her until she ran off or else the queen would have killed her it made her sad to talk about it i bet if shed been in the city she wouldnt have let them cut off fathers head orphan boys got no fathers yoren said or did you forget that the sourleaf had turned his spit red so it looked like his mouth was bleeding the only wolves we got to fear are the ones wear manskin like those who done for that village i wish i was home she said miserably she tried so hard to be brave to be fierce as a wolverine and all but sometimes she felt like she was just a little girl after all the black brother peeled a fresh sourleaf from the bale in the wagon and stuffed it into his mouth might be i should of left you where i found you boy all of you safer in the city seems to me page i dont care i want to go home been bringing men to the wall for close on thirty years froth shone on yorens lips like bubbles of blood all that time i only lost three old man died of a fever city boy got snakebit taking a shit and one fool tried to kill me in my sleep and got a red smile for his trouble he drew the dirk across his throat to show her three in thirty years he spat out the old sourleaf a ship now might have been wiser no chance o finding more men on the way but still clever man hed go by ship but me thirty years i been taking this kingsroad he sheathed his dirk go to sleep boy hear me she did try yet as she lay under her thin blanket she could hear the wolves howling and another sound fainter no more than a whisper on the wind that might have been screams chapter davos the morning air was dark with the smoke of burning gods they were all afire now maid and mother warrior and smith the crone with her pearl eyes and the father with his gilded beard even the stranger carved to look more animal than human the old dry wood and countless layers of paint and varnish blazed with a fierce hungry light heat rose shimmering through the chill air behind the gargoyles and stone dragons on the castle walls seemed blurred as if davos were seeing them through a veil of tears or as if the beasts were trembling stirring an ill thing allard declared though at least he had the sense to keep his voice low dale muttered agreement silence said davos remember where you are his sons were good men but young and allard especially was rash had i stayed a smuggler allard would have ended on the wall stannis spared him from that end something else i owe him hundreds had come to the castle gates to bear witness to the burning of the seven the smell in the air was ugly even for soldiers it was hard not to feel uneasy at such an affront to the gods most had worshiped all their lives the red woman walked round the fire three times praying once in the speech of asshai once in high valyrian and once in the common tongue davos understood only the last rhilor come to us in our darkness she called lord of light we offer you these false gods these seven who are one and him the enemy take them and cast your light upon us for the night is dark and full of terrors queen selyse echoed the words beside her stannis watched impassively his jaw hard as stone under the blueblack shadow of his tightcropped beard he had dressed more richly than was his wont as if for the sept dragonstones sept had been where aegon the conqueror knelt to pray the night before he sailed that had not saved it from the queens men they had overturned the altars pulled down the statues and smashed the stained glass with warhammers septon barre could only curse them but ser hubard page rambton led his three sons to the sept to defend their gods the rambtons had slain four of the queens men before the others overwhelmed them afterward guncer sunglass mildest and most pious of lords told stannis he could no longer support his claim now he shared a sweltering cell with the septon and ser hubards two surviving sons the other lords had not been slow to take the lesson the gods had never meant much to davos the smuggler though like most men he had been known to make offerings to the warrior before battle to the smith when he launched a ship and to the mother whenever his wife grew great with child he felt ill as he watched them burn and not only from the smoke maester cressen would have stopped this the old man had challenged the lord of light and been struck down for his impiety or so the gossips told each other davos knew the truth he had seen the maester slip something into the wine cup poison what else could it be he drank a cup of death to free stannis from melisandre but somehow her god shielded her he would gladly have killed the red woman for that yet what chance would he have where a maester of the citadel had failed he was only a smuggler raised high davos of flea bottom the onion knight the burning gods cast a pretty light wreathed in their robes of shifting flame red and orange and yellow septon barre had once told davos how theyd been carved from the masts of the ships that had carried the first targaryens from valyria over the centuries they had been painted and repainted gilded silvered jeweled their beauty will make them more pleasing to rhllor melisandre said when she told stannis to pull them down and drag them out the castle gates the maiden lay athwart the warrior her arms widespread as if to embrace him the mother seemed almost to shudder as the flames came licking up her face a longsword had been thrust through her heart and its leather grip was alive with flame the father was on the bottom the first to fall davos watched the hand of the stranger writhe and curl as the fingers blackened and fell away one by one reduced to so much glowing charcoal nearby lord celtigar coughed fitfully and covered his wrinkled face with a square of linen embroidered in red crabs the myrmen swapped jokes as they enjoyed the warmth of the fire but young lord bar emmon had turned a splotchy grey and lord velaryon was watching the king rather than the conflagration davos would have given much to know what he was thinking but one such as velaryon would never confide in him the lord of the tides was of the blood of ancient valyria and his house had thrice provided brides for targaryen princes davos seaworth stank of fish and onions it was the same with the other lordlings he could trust none of them nor would they ever include him in their private councils they scorned his sons as well my grandsons will joust with theirs though and one day their blood may wed with mine in time my little black ship will fly as high as velaryons seahorse or celtigars red crabs that is if stannis won his throne if he lost everything i am i owe to him stannis had raised him to knighthood he had given him a place of honor at his table a war galley to sail in place of a smugglers skiff dale and allard captained galleys as well maric was oarmaster on the fury matthos served his father on black betha and the king had taken devan as a royal squire one day he would be knighted and the two little lads as well marya was mistress of a small keep on cape wrath with servants who called her mlady and davos could hunt red deer in his own woods all this he had of stannis baratheon for the price of a few finger joints it was just what he did to me i had flouted the kings laws all my life he has earned my loyalty davos touched the little pouch that hung from the leather thong about his neck his fingers were his luck and he needed luck now as do we all lord stannis most of all page pale flames licked at the grey sky dark smoke rose twisting and curling when the wind pushed it toward them men blinked and wept and rubbed their eyes allard turned his head away coughing and cursing a taste of things to come thought davos many and more would burn before this war was done melisandre was robed all in scarlet satin and blood velvet her eyes as red as the great ruby that glistened at her throat as if it too were afire in ancient books of asshai it is written that there will come a day after a long summer when the stars bleed and the cold breath of darkness falls heavy on the world in this dread hour a warrior shall draw from the fire a burning sword and that sword shall be lightbringer the red sword of heroes and he who clasps it shall be azor ahai come again and the darkness shall flee before him she lifted her voice so it carried out over the gathered host azor ahai beloved of rhllor the warrior of light the son of fire come forth your sword awaits you come forth and take it into your hand stannis baratheon strode forward like a soldier marching into battle his squires stepped up to attend him davos watched as his son devan pulled a long padded glove over the kings right hand the boy wore a creamcolored doublet with a fiery heart sewn on the breast bryen farring was similarly garbed as he tied a stiff leather cape around his graces neck behind davos heard a faint clank and clatter of bells under the sea smoke rises in bubbles and flames burn green and blue and black patchface sang somewhere i know i know oh oh oh the king plunged into the fire with his teeth clenched holding the leather cloak before him to keep off the flames he went straight to the mother grasped the sword with his gloved hand and wrenched it free of the burning wood with a single hard jerk then he was retreating the sword held high jadegreen flames swirling around cherryred steel guards rushed to beat out the cinders that clung to the kings clothing a sword of fire shouted queen selyse ser axell florent and the other queens men took up the cry a sword of fire it bums it burns a sword of fire melisandre lifted her hands above her head beholdl a sign was promised and now a sign is seen behold lightbringer azor ahai has come again all hail the warrior of light all hail the son of fire a ragged wave of shouts gave answer just as stanniss glove began to smolder cursing the king thrust the point of the sword into the damp earth and beat out the flames against his leg lord cast your light upon us melisandre called out for the night is dark and full of terrors selyse and her queens men replied should i speak the words as well davos wondered do i owe stannis that much is this fiery god truly his own his shortened fingers twitched stannis peeled off the glove and let it fall to the ground the gods in the pyre were scarcely recognizable anymore the head fell off the smith with a puff of ash and embers melisandre sang in the tongue of asshai her voice rising and falling like the tides of the sea stannis untied his singed leather cape and listened in silence thrust in the ground lightbringer still glowed ruddy hot but the flames that clung to the sword were dwindling and dying by the time the song was done only charwood remained of the gods and the kings patience had run its course he took the queen by the elbow and escorted her back into dragonstone leaving lightbringer where it stood the red woman remained a moment to watch as devan knelt with byren farring and rolled up the burnt and blackened sword in the kings leather cloak the red sword of heroes looks a page proper mess thought davos a few of the lords lingered to speak in quiet voices upwind of the fire they fell silent when they saw davos looking at them should stannis fall they will pull me down in an instant neither was he counted one of the queens men that group of ambitious knights and minor lordlings who had given themselves to this lord of light and so won the favor and patronage of ladyno queen rememberselyse the fire had started to dwindle by the time melisandre and the squires departed with the precious sword davos and his sons joined the crowd making its way down to the shore and the waiting ships devan acquitted himself well he said as they went he fetched the glove without dropping it yes said dale allard nodded that badge on devans doublet the fiery heart what was that the baratheon sigil is a crowned stag a lord can choose more than one badge davos said dale smiled a black ship and an onion father allard kicked at a stone the others take our onion and that flaming heart it was an ill thing to burn the seven when did you grow so devout davos said what does a smugglers son know of the doings of gods im a knights son father if you wont remember why should they a knights son but not a knight said davos nor will you ever be if you meddle in affairs that do not concern you stannis is our rightful king it is not for us to question him we sail his ships and do his bidding that is all as to that father dale said i mislike these water casks theyve given me for wraith green pine the water will spoil on a voyage of any length i got the same for lady marya said allard the queens men have laid claim to all the seasoned wood i will speak to the king about it davos promised better it come from him than from allard his sons were good fighters and better sailors but they did not know how to talk to lords they were lowborn even as i was but they do not like to recall that when they look at our banner all they see is a tall black ship flying on the wind they close their eyes to the onion the port was as crowded as davos had ever known it every dock teemed with sailors loading provisions and every inn was packed with soldiers dicing or drinking or looking for a whore a vain search since stannis permitted none on his island ships lined the strand war galleys and fishing vessels stout carracks and fatbottomed cogs the best berths had been taken by the largest vessels stanniss flagship fury rocking between lord steffon and stag of the sea lord velaryons silverhulled pride of driftmark and her three sisters lord celtigars ornate red claw the ponderous swordfish with her long iron prow page out to sea at anchor rode salladhor saans great valyrian amongst the striped hulls of two dozen smaller lysene galleys a weathered little inn sat on the end of the stone pier where black betha wraith and lady marya shared mooring space with a halfdozen other galleys of one hundred oars or less davos had a thirst he took his leave of his sons and turned his steps toward the inn out front squatted a waisthigh gargoyle so eroded by rain and salt that his features were all but obliterated he and davos were old friends though he gave a pat to the stone head as he went in luck he murmured across the noisy common room salladhor saan sat eating grapes from a wooden bowl when he spied davos he beckoned him closer ser knight come sit with me eat a grape eat two they are marvelously sweet the lyseni was a sleek smiling man whose flamboyance was a byword on both sides of the narrow sea today he wore flashing clothofsilver with dagged sleeves so long the ends of them pooled on the floor his buttons were carved jade monkeys and atop his wispy white curls perched a jaunty green cap decorated with a fan of peacock feathers davos threaded his way through the tables to a chair in the days before his knighthood he had often bought cargoes from salladhor saan the lyseni was a smuggler himself as well as a trader a banker a notorious pirate and the selfstyled prince of the narrow sea when a pirate grows rich enough they make him a prince it had been davos who had made the journey to lys to recruit the old rogue to lord stanniss cause you did not see the gods burn my lord he asked the red priests have a great temple on lys always they are burning this and burning that crying out to their rhllor they bore me with their fires soon they will bore king stannis too it is to be hoped he seemed utterly unconcerned that someone might overhear him eating his grapes and dribbling the seeds out onto his lip flicking them off with a finger my bird of thousand colors came in yesterday good ser she is not a warship no but a trader and she paid a call on kings landing are you sure you will not have a grape children go hungry in the city it is said he dangled the grapes before davos and smiled its ale i need and news the men of westeros are ever rushing complained salladhor saan what good is this i ask you he who hurries through life hurries to his grave he belched the lord of casterly rock has sent his dwarf to see to kings landing perhaps he hopes that his ugly face will frighten off attackers eh or that we will laugh ourselves dead when the imp capers on the battlements who can say the dwarf has chased off the lout who ruled the gold cloaks and put in his place a knight with an iron hand he plucked a grape and squeezed it between thumb and forefinger until the skin burst juice ran down between his fingers a serving girl pushed her way through swatting at the hands that groped her as she passed davos ordered a tankard of ale turned back to saan and said how well is the city defended the other shrugged the walls are high and strong but who will man them they are building scorpions and spitfires oh yes but the men in the golden cloaks are too few and too green and there are no others a swift strike like a hawk plummeting at a hare and the great city will be ours grant us wind to fill our sails and your king could sit upon his iron throne by evenfall on the morrow we could dress the dwarf in motley and prick his little cheeks with the points of our spears to make him dance for us and page mayhaps your goodly king would make me a gift of the beautiful queen cersei to warm my bed for a night i have been too long away from my wives and all in his service pirate said davos you have no wives only concubines and you have been well paid for every day and every ship only in promises said salladhor saan mournfully good ser it is gold i crave not words on papers he popped a grape into his mouth youll have your gold when we take the treasury in kings landing no man in the seven kingdoms is more honorable than stannis baratheon he will keep his word even as davos spoke he thought this world is twisted beyond hope when lowborn smugglers must vouch for the honor of kings so he has said and said and so i say let us do this thing even these grapes could be no more ripe than that city my old friend the serving girl returned with his ale davos gave her a copper might be we could take kings landing as you say he said as he lifted the tankard but how long would we hold it tywin lannister is known to be at harrenhal with a great host and lord renly ah yes the young brother said salladhor saan that part is not so good my friend king renly bestirs himself no here he is lord renly my pardons so many kings my tongue grows weary of the word the brother renly has left highgarden with his fair young queen his flowered lords and shining knights and a mighty host of foot he marches up your road of roses toward the very same great city we were speaking of he takes his bride the other shrugged he did not tell me why perhaps he is loath to part with the warm burrow between her thighs even for a night or perhaps he is that certain of his victory the king must be told i have attended to it good ser though his grace frowns so whenever he does see me that i tremble to come before him do you think he would like me better if i wore a hair shirt and never smiled well i will not do it i am an honest man he must suffer me in silk and samite or else i shall take my ships where i am better loved that sword was not lightbringer my friend the sudden shift in subject left davos uneasy sword a sword plucked from fire yes men tell me things it is my pleasant smile how shall a burnt sword serve stannis a buming sword corrected davos burnt said salladhor saan and be glad of that my friend do you know the tale of the forging of lightbringer i shall tell it to you it was a time when darkness lay heavy on the world to oppose it the hero must have a heros blade oh like none that had ever been and so for thirty days and thirty nights azor ahai labored sleepless in the temple forging a blade in the sacred fires heat and hammer and fold heat and hammer and fold oh yes until the sword was done yet when he plunged it into water to temper the steel it burst asunder page being a hero it was not for him to shrug and go in search of excellent grapes such as these so again he began the second time it took him fifty days and fifty nights and this sword seemed even finer than the first azor ahai captured a lion to temper the blade by plunging it through the beasts red heart but once more the steel shattered and split great was his woe and great was his sorrow then for he knew what he must do a hundred days and a hundred nights he labored on the third blade and as it glowed whitehot in the sacred fires he summoned his wife nissa nissa he said to her for that was her name bare your breast and know that i love you best of all that is in this world she did this thing why i cannot say and azor ahai thrust the smoking sword through her living heart it is said that her cry of anguish and ecstasy left a crack across the face of the moon but her blood and her soul and her strength and her courage all went into the steel such is the tale of the forging of lightbringer the red sword of heroes now do you see my meaning be glad that it is just a burnt sword that his grace pulled from that fire too much light can hurt the eyes my friend and fire bums salladhor saan finished the last grape and smacked his lips when do you think the king will bid us sail good ser soon i think said davos if his god wills it his god ser friend not yours where is the god of ser davos seaworth knight of the onion ship davos sipped his ale to give himself a moment the inn is crowded and you are not salladhor saan he reminded himself be careful how you answer king stannis is my god he made me and blessed me with his trust i will remember salladhor saan got to his feet my pardons these grapes have given me a hunger and dinner awaits on my valyrian minced lamb with pepper and roasted gull stuffed with mushrooms and fennel and onion soon we shall eat together in kings landing yes in the red keep we shall feast while the dwarf sings us a jolly tune when you speak to king stannis mention if you would that he will owe me another thirty thousand dragons come the black of the moon he ought to have given those gods to me they were too beautiful to burn and might have brought a noble price in pentos or myr well if he grants me queen cersei for a night i shall forgive him the lyseni clapped davos on the back and swaggered from the inn as if he owned it ser davos seaworth lingered over his tankard for a good while thinking a year ago he had been with stannis in kings landing when king robert staged a tourney for prince joffreys name day he remembered the red priest thoros of myr and the flaming sword he had wielded in the melee the man had made for a colorful spectacle his red robes flapping while his blade writhed with pale green flames but everyone knew there was no true magic to it and in the end his fire had guttered out and bronze yohn royce had brained him with a common mace a true sword of fire now that would be a wonder to behold yet at such a cost when he thought of nissa nissa it was his own marya he pictured a goodnatured plump woman with sagging breasts and a kindly smile the best woman in the world he tried to picture himself driving a sword through her and shuddered i am not made of the stuff of heroes he decided if that was the price of a magic sword it was more than he cared to pay davos finished his ale pushed away the tankard and left the inn on the way out he patted the gargoyle on the head and muttered luck they would all need it page it was well after dark when devan came down to black betha leading a snowwhite palfrey my lord father he announced his grace commands you to attend him in the chamber of the painted table you are to ride the horse and come at once it was good to see devan looking so splendid in his squires raiment but the summons made davos uneasy will he bid us sail he wondered salladhor saan was not the only captain who felt that kings landing was ripe for an attack but a smuggler must learn patience we have no hope of victory i said as much to maester cressen the day i returned to dragonstone and nothing has changed we are too few the foes too many ff we dip our oars we die nonetheless he climbed onto the horse when davos arrived at the stone drum a dozen highborn knights and great bannermen were just leaving lords celtigar and velaryon each gave him a curt nod and walked on while the others ignored him utterly but ser axell florent stopped for a word queen selyses uncle was a keg of a man with thick arms and bandy legs he had the prominent ears of a florent even larger than his nieces the coarse hair that sprouted from his did not stop him hearing most of what went on in the castle for ten years ser axell had served as castelian of dragonstone while stannis sat on roberts council in kings landing but of late he had emerged as the foremost of the queens men ser davos it is good to see you as ever he said and you my lord i made note of you this morning as well the false gods burned with a merry light did they not they burned brightly davos did not trust this man for all his courtesy house florent had declared for renly the lady melisandre tells us that sometimes rhllor permits his faithful servants to glimpse the future in flames it seemed to me as i watched the fire this morning that i was looking at a dozen beautiful dancers maidens garbed in yellow silk spinning and swirling before a great king i think it was a true vision ser a glimpse of the glory that awaits his grace after we take kings landing and the throne that is his by rights stannis has no taste for such dancing davos thought but he dared not offend the queens uncle i saw only fire he said but the smoke was making my eyes water you must pardon me ser the king awaits he pushed past wondering why ser axell had troubled himself he is a queens man and i am the kings stannis sat at his painted table with maester pylos at his shoulder an untidy pile of papers before them ser the king said when davos entered come have a look at this letter obediently he selected a paper at random it looks handsome enough your grace but i fear i cannot read the words davos could decipher maps and charts as well as any but letters and other writings were beyond his powers but my devan has learned his letters and young steffon and stannis as well id forgotten a furrow of irritation showed between the kings brows pylos read it to him your grace the maester took up one of the parchments and cleared his throat all men know me for the trueborn son of steffon baratheon page lord of storms end by his lady wife cassana of house estermont i declare upon the honor of my house that my beloved brother robert our late king left no trueborn issue of his body the boy foffrey the boy tommen and the girl myrcella being abominations born of incest between cersei lannister and her brother faime the kingslayer by right of birth and blood i do this day lay claim to the iron throne of the seven kingdoms of westeros let all true men declare their loyalty done in the light of the lord under the sign and seal of stannis of house baratheon the first of his name king of the andals the rhoynar and the first men and lord of the seven kingdoms the parchment rustled softly as pylos laid it down make it ser jaime the kingslayer henceforth stannis said frowning whatever else the man may be he remains a knight i dont know that we ought to call robert my beloved brother either he loved me no more than he had to nor i him a harmless courtesy your grace pylos said a lie take it out stannis turned to davos the maester tells me that we have one hundred seventeen ravens on hand i mean to use them all one hundred seventeen ravens will carry one hundred seventeen copies of my letter to every corner of the realm from the arbor to the wall perhaps a hundred will win through against storm and hawk and arrow if so a hundred maesters will read my words to as many lords in as many solars and bedchambers and then the letters will like as not be consigned to the fire and lips pledged to silence these great lords love joffrey or renly or robb stark i am their rightful king but they will deny me if they can so i have need of you i am yours to command my king as ever stannis nodded i mean for you to sail black betha north to gulltown the fingers the three sisters even white harbor your son dale will go south in wraith past cape wrath and the broken arm all along the coast of dorne as far as the arbor each of you will carry a chest of letters and you will deliver one to every port and holdfast and fishing village nail them to the doors of septs and inns for every man to read who can davos said that will be few enough ser davos speaks truly your grace said maester pylos it would be better to have the letters read aloud better but more dangerous said stannis these words will not be kindly received give me knights to do the reading davos said that will carry more weight than anything i might say stannis seemed well satisfied with that i can give you such men yes i have a hundred knights who would sooner read than fight be open where you can and stealthy where you must use every smugglers trick you know the black sails the hidden coves whatever it requires if you run short of letters capture a few septons and set them to copying out more i mean to use your second son as well he will take lady marya across the narrow sea to braavos and the other free cities to deliver other letters to the men who rule there the world will know of my claim and of cerseis infamy you can tell them davos thought but will they believe he glanced thoughtfully at maester pylos the page king caught the look maester perhaps you ought get to your writing we will need a great many letters and soon as you will pylos bowed and took his leave the king waited until he was gone before he said what is it you would not say in the presence of my maester davos my liege pylos is pleasant enough but i cannot see the chain about his neck without mourning for maester cressen is it his fault the old man died stannis glanced into the fire i never wanted cressen at that feast hed angered me yes hed given me bad counsel but i did not want him dead id hoped he might be granted a few years of ease and comfort he had earned that much at least buthe ground his teeth togetherbut he died and pylos serves me ably pylos is the least of it the letter what did your lords make of it i wonder stannis snorted celtigar pronounced it admirable if i showed him the contents of my privy he would declare that admirable as well the others bobbed their heads up and down like a flock of geese all but velaryon who said that steel would decide the matter not words on parchment as if i had never suspected the others take my lords ill hear your views your words were blunt and strong and true and true yet you have no proof of this incest no more than you did a year ago theres proof of a sort at storms end roberts bastard the one he fathered on my wedding night in the very bed theyd made up for me and my bride delena was a florent and a maiden when he took her so robert acknowledged the babe edric storm they call him he is said to be the very image of my brother if men were to see him and then look again at joffrey and tommen they could not help but wonder i would think yet how are men to see him if he is at storms end stannis drummed his fingers on the painted table it is a difficulty one of many he raised his eyes you have more to say about the letter well get on with it i did not make you a knight so you could learn to mouth empty courtesies i have my lords for that say what you would say davos davos bowed his head there was a phrase at the end how did it go done in the light of the lord yes the kings jaw was clenched your people will mislike those words as you did said stannis sharply page if you were to say instead done in the sight of gods and men or by the grace of the gods old and new have you gone devout on me smuggler that was to be my question for you my liege was it now it sounds as though you love my new god no more than you love my new maester i do not know this lord of light davos admitted but i knew the gods we burned this morning the smith has kept my ships safe while the mother has given me seven strong sons your wife has given you seven strong sons do you pray to her it was wood we burned this morning that may be so davos said but when i was a boy in flea bottom begging for a copper sometimes the septons would feed me i feed you now you have given me an honored place at your table and in return i give you truth your people will not love you if you take from them the gods they have always worshiped and give them one whose very name sounds queer on their tongues stannis stood abruptly rhllor why is that so hard they will not love me you say when have they ever loved me how can i lose something i have never owned he moved to the south window to gaze out at the moonlit sea i stopped believing in gods the day i saw the windproud break up across the bay any gods so monstrous as to drown my mother and father would never have my worship i vowed in kings landing the high septon would prattle at me of how all justice and goodness flowed from the seven but all i ever saw of either was made by men if you do not believe in gods why trouble with this new one stannis broke in i have asked myself as well i know little and care less of gods but the red priestess has power yes but what sort of power cressen had wisdom i trusted in his wisdom and your wiles and what did they avail me smuggler the storm lords sent you packing i went to them a beggar and they laughed at me well there will be no more begging and no more laughing either the iron throne is mine by rights but how am i to take it there are four kings in the realm and three of them have more men and more gold than i do i have ships and i have her the red woman half my knights are afraid even to say her name did you know if she can do nothing else a sorceress who can inspire such dread in grown men is not to be despised a frightened man is a beaten man and perhaps she can do more i mean to find out when i was a lad i found an injured goshawk and nursed her back to health proudwing i named her she would perch on my shoulder and flutter from room to room after me and take food from my hand but she would not soar time and again i would take her hawking but she never flew higher than the page treetops robert called her weakwing he owned a gyrfalcon named thunderclap who never missed her strike one day our greatuncle ser harbert told me to try a different bird i was making a fool of myself with proudwing he said and he was right stannis baratheon turned away from the window and the ghosts who moved upon the southern sea the seven have never brought me so much as a sparrow it is time i tried another hawk davos a red hawk chapter theon there was no safe anchorage at pyke but theon greyjoy wished to look on his fathers castle from the sea to see it as he had seen it last ten years before when robert baratheons war galley had borne him away to be a ward of eddard stark on that day he had stood beside the rail listening to the stroke of the oars and the pounding of the masters drum while he watched pyke dwindle in the distance now he wanted to see it grow larger to rise from the sea before him obedient to his wishes the myraham beat her way past the point with her sails snapping and her captain cursing the wind and his crew and the follies of highborn lordlings theon drew the hood of his cloak up against the spray and looked for home the shore was all sharp rocks and glowering cliffs and the castle seemed one with the rest its towers and walls and bridges quarried from the same greyblack stone wet by the same salt waves festooned with the same spreading patches of dark green lichen speckled by the droppings of the same seabirds the point of land on which the greyjoys had raised their fortress had once thrust like a sword into the bowels of the ocean but the waves had hammered at it day and night until the land broke and shattered thousands of years past all that remained were three bare and barren islands and a dozen towering stacks of rock that rose from the water like the pillars of some sea gods temple while the angry waves foamed and crashed among them drear dark forbidding pyke stood atop those islands and pillars almost a part of them its curtain wall closing off the headland around the foot of the great stone bridge that leapt from the clifftop to the largest islet dominated by the massive bulk of the great keep farther out were the kitchen keep and the bloody keep each on its own island towers and outbuildings clung to the stacks beyond linked to each other by covered archways when the pillars stood close by long swaying walks of wood and rope when they did not the sea tower rose from the outmost island at the point of the broken sword the oldest part of the castle round and tall the sheersided pillar on which it stood halfeaten through by the endless battering of the waves the base of the tower was white from centuries of salt spray the upper stories green from the lichen that crawled over it like a thick blanket the jagged crown black with soot from its nightly watchfire above the sea tower snapped his fathers banner the myraham was too far off for theon to see more than the cloth itself but he knew the device it bore the golden kraken of house greyjoy arms writhing and reaching against a black field the banner streamed from an iron mast shivering and twisting as the wind gusted like a bird struggling to take flight and here at least the direwolf of stark did not fly above page casting its shadow down upon the greyjoy kraken theon had never seen a more stirring sight in the sky behind the castle the fine red tail of the comet was visible through thin scuttling clouds all the way from riverrun to seagard the mallisters had argued about its meaning it is my comet theon told himself sliding a hand into his furlined cloak to touch the oilskin pouch snug in its pocket inside was the letter robb stark had given him paper as good as a crown does the castle look as you remember it milord the captains daughter asked as she pressed herself against his arm it looks smaller theon confessed though perhaps that is only the distance the myraham was a fatbellied southron merchanter up from oldtown carrying wine and cloth and seed to trade for iron ore her captain was a fatbellied southron merchanter as well and the stony sea that foamed at the feet of the castle made his plump lips quiver so he stayed well out farther than theon would have liked an ironborn captain in a longship would have taken them along the cliffs and under the high bridge that spanned the gap between the gatehouse and the great keep but this plump oldtowner had neither the craft the crew nor the courage to attempt such a thing so they sailed past at a safe distance and theon must content himself with seeing pyke from afar even so the myraham had to struggle mightily to keep itself off those rocks it must be windy there the captains daughter observed he laughed windy and cold and damp a miserable hard place in truth but my lord father once told me that hard places breed hard men and hard men rule the world the captains face was as green as the sea when he came bowing up to theon and asked may we make for port now milord you may theon said a faint smile playing about his lips the promise of gold had turned the oldtowner into a shameless lickspittle it would have been a much different voyage if a longship from the islands had been waiting at seagard as hed hoped ironborn captains were proud and willful and did not go in awe of a mans blood the islands were too small for awe and a longship smaller still if every captain was a king aboard his own ship as was often said it was small wonder they named the islands the land of ten thousand kings and when you have seen your kings shit over the rail and turn green in a storm it was hard to bend the knee and pretend they were gods the drowned god makes men old king urron redhand had once said thousands of years ago but its men who make crowns a longship would have made the crossing in half the time as well the myraham was a wallowing tub if truth be told and he would not care to be aboard her in a storm still theon could not be too unhappy he was here undrowned and the voyage had offered certain other amusements he put an arm around the captains daughter summon me when we make lordsport he told her father well be below in my cabin he led the girl away aft while her father watched them go in sullen silence the cabin was the captains in truth but it had been turned over to theons use when they sailed from seagard the captains daughter had not been turned over to his use but she had come to his bed willingly enough all the same a cup of wine a few whispers and there she was the girl was a shade plump for his taste with skin as splotchy as oatmeal but her breasts filled his hands nicely and she had been a maiden the first time he took her that was surprising at her age but theon found it diverting he page did not think the captain approved and that was amusing as well watching the man struggle to swallow his outrage while performing his courtesies to the high lord the rich purse of gold hed been promised never far from his thoughts as theon shrugged out of his wet cloak the girl said you must be so happy to see your home again milord how many years have you been away ten or close as makes no matter he told her i was a boy of ten when i was taken to winterfell as a ward of eddard stark a ward in name a hostage in truth half his days a hostage but no longer his life was his own again and nowhere a stark to be seen he drew the captains daughter close and kissed her on her ear take off your cloak she dropped her eyes suddenly shy but did as he bid her when the heavy garment sodden with spray fell from her shoulders to the deck she gave him a little bow and smiled anxiously she looked rather stupid when she smiled but he had never required a woman to be clever come here he told her she did i have never seen the iron islands count yourself fortunate theon stroked her hair it was fine and dark though the wind had made a tangle of it the islands are stern and stony places scant of comfort and bleak of prospect death is never far here and life is mean and meager men spend their nights drinking ale and arguing over whose lot is worse the fisherfolk who fight the sea or the farmers who try and scratch a crop from the poor thin soil if truth be told the miners have it worse than either breaking their backs down in the dark and for what iron lead tin those are our treasures small wonder the ironmen of old turned to raiding the stupid girl did not seem to be listening i could go ashore with you she said i would if it please you you could go ashore theon agreed squeezing her breast but not with me i fear id work in your castle milord i can clean fish and bake bread and churn butter father says my peppercrab stew is the best hes ever tasted you could find me a place in your kitchens and i could make you peppercrab stew and warm my bed by night he reached for the laces of her bodice and began to undo them his fingers deft and practiced once i might have carried you home as a prize and kept you to wife whether you willed it or no the ironmen of old did such things a man had his rock wife his true bride ironborn like himself but he had his salt wives too women captured on raids the girls eyes grew wide and not because he had bared her breasts i would be your salt wife milord i fear those days are gone theons finger circled one heavy teat spiraling in toward the fat brown nipple no longer may we ride the wind with fire and sword taking what we want now we scratch in the ground and toss lines in the sea like other men and count ourselves lucky if we have salt cod and porridge enough to get us through a winter he took her nipple in his mouth and bit it until she gasped you can put it in me again if it please you she whispered in his ear as he sucked when he raised his head from her breast the skin was dark red where his mouth had marked her it page would please me to teach you something new unlace me and pleasure me with your mouth with my mouth his thumb brushed lightly over her full lips its what those lips were made for sweetling if you were my salt wife youd do as i command she was timid at first but learned quickly for such a stupid girl which pleased him her mouth was as wet and sweet as her cunt and this way he did not have to listen to her mindless prattle once i would have kept her as a salt wife in truth he thought to himself as he slid his fingers through her tangled hair once when we still kept the old way lived by the axe instead of the pick taking what we would be it wealth women or glory in those days the ironborn did not work mines that was labor for the captives brought back from the hostings and so too the sorry business of farming and tending goats and sheep war was an ironmans proper trade the drowned god had made them to reave and rape to carve out kingdoms and write their names in fire and blood and song aegon the dragon had destroyed the old way when he burned black harren gave harrens kingdom back to the weakling rivermen and reduced the iron islands to an insignificant backwater of a much greater realm yet the old red tales were still told around driftwood fires and smoky hearths all across the islands even behind the high stone halls of pyke theons father numbered among his titles the style of lord reaper and the greyjoy words boasted that we do not sow it had been to bring back the old way more than for the empty vanity of a crown that lord balon had staged his great rebellion robert baratheon had written a bloody end to that hope with the help of his friend eddard stark but both men were dead now mere boys ruled in their stead and the realm that aegon the conqueror had forged was smashed and sundered this is the season theon thought as the captains daughter slid her lips up and down the length of him the season the year the day and i am the man he smiled crookedly wondering what his father would say when theon told him that he the lastborn babe and hostage he had succeeded where lord balon himself had failed his climax came on him sudden as a storm and he filled the girls mouth with his seed startled she tried to pull away but theon held her tight by the hair afterward she crawled up beside him did i please milord well enough he told her it tasted salty she murmured like the sea she nodded i have always loved the sea milord as i have he said rolling her nipple idly between his fingers it was true the sea meant freedom to the men of the iron islands he had forgotten that until the myraham had raised sail at seagard the sounds brought old feelings back the creak of wood and rope the captains shouted commands the snap of the sails as the wind filled them each as familiar as the beating of his own heart and as comforting i must remember this theon vowed to himself i must never go far from the sea again take me with you milord the captains daughter begged i dont need to go to your castle i can stay page in some town and be your salt wife she reached out to stroke his cheek theon greyjoy pushed her hand aside and climbed off the bunk my place is pyke and yours is on this ship i cant stay here now he laced up his breeches why not my father she told him once youre gone hell punish me milord hell call me names and hit me theon swept his cloak off its peg and over his shoulders fathers are like that he admitted as he pinned the folds with a silver clasp tell him he should be pleased as many times as ive fucked you youre likely with child its not every man who has the honor of raising a kings bastard she looked at him stupidly so he left her there the myraham was rounding a wooded point below the pineclad bluffs a dozen fishing boats were pulling in their nets the big cog stayed well out from them tacking theon moved to the bow for a better view he saw the castle first the stronghold of the botleys when he was a boy it had been timber and wattle but robert baratheon had razed that structure to the ground lord sawane had rebuilt in stone for now a small square keep crowned the hill pale green flags drooped from the squat corner towers each emblazoned with a shoal of silvery fish beneath the dubious protection of the fishridden little castle lay the village of lordsport its harbor aswarm with ships when last hed seen lordsport it had been a smoking wasteland the skeletons of burnt longships and smashed galleys littering the stony shore like the bones of dead leviathans the houses no more than broken walls and cold ashes after ten years few traces of the war remained the smallfolk had built new hovels with the stones of the old and cut fresh sod for their roofs a new inn had risen beside the landing twice the size of the old one with a lower story of cut stone and two upper stories of timber the sept beyond had never been rebuilt though only a sevensided foundation remained where it had stood robert baratheons fury had soured the ironmens taste for the new gods it would seem theon was more interested in ships than gods among the masts of countless fishing boats he spied a tyroshi trading galley offloading beside a lumbering ibbenese cog with her blacktarred hull a great number of longships fifty or sixty at the least stood out to sea or lay beached on the pebbled shore to the north some of the sails bore devices from the other islands the blood moon of wynch lord goodbrothers banded black warhorn harlaws silver scythe theon searched for his uncle eurons silence of that lean and terrible red ship he saw no sign but his fathers great kraken was there her bow ornamented with a grey iron ram in the shape of its namesake had lord balon anticipated him and called the greyjoy banners his hand went inside his cloak again to the oilskin pouch no one knew of his letter but robb stark they were no fools to entrust their secrets to a bird still lord balon was no fool either he might well have guessed why his son was coming home at long last and acted accordingly the thought did not please him his fathers war was long done and lost this was theons hourhis plan his glory and in time his crown yet if the longships are hosting page it might be only a caution now that he thought on it a defensive move lest the war spill out across the sea old men were cautious by nature his father was old now and so too his uncle victarion who commanded the iron fleet his uncle euron was a different song to be sure but the silence did not seem to be in port its all for the good theon told himself this way i shall be able to strike all the more quickly as the myraham made her way landward theon paced the deck restlessly scanning the shore he had not thought to find lord balon himself at quayside but surely his father would have sent someone to meet him sylas sourmouth the steward lord botley perhaps even dagmer cleftjaw it would be good to look on dagmers hideous old face again it was not as though they had no word of his arrival robb had sent ravens from riverrun and when theyd found no longship at seagard jason mallister had sent his own birds to pyke supposing that robbs were lost yet he saw no familiar faces no honor guard waiting to escort him from lordsport to pyke only smallfolk going about their small business shorehands rolled casks of wine off the tyroshi trader fisherfolk cried the days catch children ran and played a priest in the seawater robes of the drowned god was leading a pair of horses along the pebbled shore while above him a slattern leaned out a window in the inn calling out to some passing ibbenese sailors a handful of lordsport merchants had gathered to meet the ship they shouted questions as the myraham was tying up were out of oldtown the captain called down bearing apples and oranges wines from the arbor feathers from the summer isles i have pepper woven leathers a bolt of myrish lace mirrors for milady a pair of oldtown woodharps sweet as any you ever heard the gangplank descended with a creak and a thud and ive brought your heir back to you the lordsport men gazed on theon with blank bovine eyes and he realized that they did not know who he was it made him angry he pressed a golden dragon into the captains palm have your men bring my things without waiting for a reply he strode down the gangplank innkeeper he barked i require a horse as you say mlord the man responded without so much as a bow he had forgotten how bold the ironborn could be happens as i have one might do where would you be riding mlord pyke the fool still did not know him he should have worn his good doublet with the kraken embroidered on the breast youll want to be off soon to reach pyke afore dark the innkeeper said my boy will go with you and show you the way your boy will not be needed a deep voice called nor your horse i shall see my nephew back to his fathers house the speaker was the priest he had seen leading the horses along the shoreline as the man approached the smallfolk bent the knee and theon heard the innkeeper murmur damphair tall and thin with fierce black eyes and a beak of a nose the priest was garbed in mottled robes of green and grey and blue the swirling colors of the drowned god a waterskin hung under his arm on a leather strap and ropes of dried seaweed were braided through his waistlong black hair and untrimmed beard a memory prodded at theon in one of his rare curt letters lord balon had written of his youngest page brother going down in a storm and turning holy when he washed up safe on shore uncle aeron he said doubtfully nephew theon the priest replied your lord father bid me fetch you come in a moment uncle he turned back to the myraham my things he commanded the captain a sailor fetched him down his tall yew bow and quiver of arrows but it was the captains daughter who brought the pack with his good clothing milord her eyes were red when he took the pack she made as if to embrace him there in front of her own father and his priestly uncle and half the island theon turned deftly aside you have my thanks please she said i do love you well milord i must go he hurried after his uncle who was already well down the pier theon caught him with a dozen long strides i had not looked for you uncle after ten years i thought perhaps my lord father and lady mother might come themselves or send dagmer with an honor guard it is not for you to question the commands of the lord reaper of pyke the priests manner was chilly most unlike the man theon remembered aeron greyjoy had been the most amiable of his uncles feckless and quick to laugh fond of songs ale and women as to dagmer the cleftiaw is gone to old wyk at your fathers behest to roust the stonehouses and the drumms to what purpose why are the longships hosting why have longships ever hosted his uncle had left the horses tied up in front of the waterside inn when they reached them he turned to theon tell me true nephew do you pray to the wolf gods now theon seldom prayed at all but that was not something you confessed to a priest even your fathers own brother ned stark prayed to a tree no i care nothing for starks gods good kneel the ground was all stones and mud uncle i kneel or are you too proud now a lordling of the green lands come among us theon knelt he had a purpose here and might need aerons help to achieve it a crown was worth a little mud and horseshit on his breeches he supposed bow your head lifting the skin his uncle pulled the cork and directed a thin stream of seawater down upon theons head it drenched his hair and ran over his forehead into his eyes sheets washed down his cheeks and a finger crept under his cloak and doublet and down his back a cold rivulet along his spine the salt made his eyes burn until it was all he could do not to cry out he could taste the ocean on his lips let theon your servant be born again from the sea as you were aeron greyjoy intoned bless him with salt bless him with stone bless him with steel nephew do you still know the words page what is dead may never die theon said remembering what is dead may never die his uncle echoed but rises again harder and stronger stand theon stood blinking back tears from the salt in his eyes wordless his uncle corked the waterskin untied his horse and mounted theon did the same they set off together leaving the inn and the harbor behind them up past the castle of lord botley into the stony hills the priest ventured no further word i have been half my life away from home theon ventured at last will i find the islands changed men fish the sea dig in the earth and die women birth children in blood and pain and die night follows day the winds and tides remain the islands are as our god made them gods he has grown grim theon thought will i find my sister and my lady mother at pyke you will not your mother dwells on harlaw with her own sister it is less raw there and her cough troubles her your sister has taken black wind to great wyk with messages from your lord father she will return eer long you may be sure theon did not need to be told that black wind was ashas longship he had not seen his sister in ten years but that much he knew of her odd that she would call it that when robb stark had a wolf named grey wind stark is grey and greyjoys black he murmured smiling but it seems were both windy the priest had nothing to say to that and what of you uncle theon asked you were no priest when i was taken from pyke i remember how you would sing the old reaving songs standing on the table with a horn of ale in hand young i was and vain aeron greyjoy said but the sea washed my follies and my vanities away that man drowned nephew his lungs filled with seawater and the fish ate the scales off his eyes when i rose again i saw clearly he is as mad as he is sour theon had liked what he remembered of the old aeron greyjoy uncle why has my father called his swords and sails doubtless he will tell you at pyke i would know his plans now from me you shall not we are commanded not to speak of this to any man even to me theons anger flared hed led men in war hunted with a king won honor in tourney melees ridden with brynden blackfish and greatjon umber fought in the whispering wood bedded more girls than he could name and yet this uncle was treating him as though he were still a child of ten if my father makes plans for war i must know of them i am not any man i am heir to pyke and the iron islands as to that his uncle said we shall see the words were a slap in the face we shall see my brothers are both dead i am my lord fathers page only living son your sister lives asha he thought confounded she was three years older than theon yet still a woman may inherit only if there is no male heir in the direct line he insisted loudly i will not be cheated of my rights i warn you his uncle grunted you warn a servant of the drowned god boy you have forgotten more than you know and you are a great fool if you believe your lord father will ever hand these holy islands over to a stark now be silent the ride is long enough without your magpie chatterings theon held his tongue though not without struggle so that is the way of it he thought as if ten years in winterfell could make a stark lord eddard had raised him among his own children but theon had never been one of them the whole castle from lady stark to the lowliest kitchen scullion knew he was hostage to his fathers good behavior and treated him accordingly even the bastard jon snow had been accorded more honor than he had lord eddard had tried to play the father from time to time but to theon he had always remained the man whod brought blood and fire to pyke and taken him from his home as a boy he had lived in fear of starks stern face and great dark sword his wife was if anything even more distant and suspicious as for their children the younger ones had been mewling babes for most of his years at winterfell only robb and his baseborn half brother jon snow had been old enough to be worth his notice the bastard was a sullen boy quick to sense a slight jealous of theons high birth and robbs regard for him for robb himself theon did have a certain affection as for a younger brother but it would be best not to mention that in pyke it would seem the old wars were still being fought that ought not surprise him the iron islands lived in the past the present was too hard and bitter to be borne besides his father and uncles were old and the old lords were like that they took their dusty feuds to the grave forgetting nothing and forgiving less it had been the same with the mallisters his companions on the ride from riverrun to seagard patrek mallister was not too ill a fellow they shared a taste for wenches wine and hawking but when old lord jason saw his heir growing overly fond of theons company he had taken patrek aside to remind him that seagard had been built to defend the coast against reavers from the iron islands the greyjoys of pyke chief among them their booming tower was named for its immense bronze bell rung of old to call the townsfolk and farmhands into the castle when longships were sighted on the western horizon never mind that the bell has been rung just once in three hundred years patrek had told theon the day after as he shared his fathers cautions and a jug of greenapple wine when my brother stormed seagard theon said lord jason had slain rodrik greyjoy under the walls of the castle and thrown the ironmen back into the bay if your father supposes i bear him some enmity for that its only because he never knew rodrik they had a laugh over that as they raced ahead to an amorous young millers wife that patrek knew would that patrek were with me now mallister or no he was a more amiable riding companion than this sour old priest that his uncle aeron had turned into the path they rode wound up and up into bare and stony hills soon page they were out of sight of the sea though the smell of salt still hung sharp in the damp air they kept a steady plodding pace past a shepherds croft and the abandoned workings of a mine this new holy aeron greyjoy was not much for talk they rode in a gloom of silence finally theon could suffer it no longer robb stark is lord of winterfell now he said aeron rode on one wolf is much like the other robb has broken fealty with the iron throne and crowned himself king in the north theres war the maesters ravens fly over salt as soon as rock this news is old and cold it means a new day uncle every morning brings a new day much like the old in riverrun they would tell you different they say the red comet is a herald of a new age a messenger from the gods a sign it is the priest agreed but from our god not theirs a burning brand it is such as our people carried of old it is the flame the drowned god brought from the sea and it proclaims a rising tide it is time to hoist our sails and go forth into the world with fire and sword as he did theon smiled i could not agree more a man agrees with god as a raindrop with the storm this raindrop will one day be a king old man theon had suffered quite enough of his uncles gloom he put his spurs into his horse and trotted on ahead smiling it was nigh on sunset when they reached the walls of pyke a crescent of dark stone that ran from cliff to cliff with the gatehouse in the center and three square towers to either side theon could still make out the scars left by the stones of robert baratheons catapults a new south tower had risen from the ruins of the old its stone a paler shade of grey and as yet unmarred by patches of lichen that was where robert had made his breach swarming in over the rubble and corpses with his warharnmer in hand and ned stark at his side theon had watched from the safety of the sea tower and sometimes he still saw the torches in his dreams and heard the dull thunder of the collapse the gates stood open to him the rusted iron portcullis drawn up the guards atop the battlements watched with strangers eyes as theon greyjoy came home at last beyond the curtain wall were half a hundred acres of headland hard against the sky and the sea the stables were here and the kennels and a scatter of other outbuildings sheep and swine huddled in their pens while the castle dogs ran free to the south were the cliffs and the wide stone bridge to the great keep theon could hear the crashing of waves as he swung down from his saddle a stableman came to take his horse a pair of gaunt children and some thralls stared at him with dull eyes but there was no sign of his lord father nor anyone else he recalled from boyhood a bleak and bitter homecoming he thought the priest had not dismounted will you not stay the night and share our meat and mead uncle page bring you i was told you are brought now i return to our gods business aeron greyjoy turned his horse and rode slowly out beneath the muddy spikes of the portcullis a bentback old crone in a shapeless grey dress approached him warily mlord i am sent to show you to chambers by whose bidding your lord father mlord theon pulled off his gloves so you do know who i am why is my father not here to greet me he awaits you in the sea tower mlord when you are rested from your trip and i thought ned stark cold and who are you helya who keeps this castle for your lord father sylas was steward here they called him sourmouth even now theon could recall the winey stench of the old mans breath dead these five years mlord and what of maester qalen where is he he sleeps in the sea wendamyr keeps the ravens now it is as if i were a stranger here theon thought nothing has changed and yet everything has changed show me to my chambers woman he commanded bowing stiffly she led him across the headland to the bridge that at least was as he remembered the ancient stones slick with spray and spotted by lichen the sea foaming under their feet like some great wild beast the salt wind clutching at their clothes whenever hed imagined his homecoming he had always pictured himself returning to the snug bedchamber in the sea tower where hed slept as a child instead the old woman led him to the bloody keep the halls here were larger and better furnished if no less cold nor damp theon was given a suite of chilly rooms with ceilings so high that they were lost in gloom he might have been more impressed if he had not known that these were the very chambers that had given the bloody keep its name a thousand years before the sons of the river king had been slaughtered here hacked to bits in their beds so that pieces of their bodies might be sent back to their father on the mainland but greyjoys were not murdered in pyke except once in a great while by their brothers and his brothers were both dead it was not fear of ghosts that made him glance about with distaste the wall hangings were green with mildew the mattress mustysmelling and sagging the rushes old and brittle years had come and gone since these chambers had last been opened the damp went bone deep ill have a basin of hot water and a fire in this hearth he told the crone see that they light braziers in the other rooms to drive out some of the chill and gods be good get someone in here at once to change these rushes yes mlord as you command she fled page after some time they brought the hot water he had asked for it was only tepid and soon cold and seawater in the bargain but it served to wash the dust of the long ride from his face and hair and hands while two thralls lit his braziers theon stripped off his travelstained clothing and dressed to meet his father he chose boots of supple black leather soft lambswool breeches of silverygrey a black velvet doublet with the golden kraken of the greyjoys embroidered on the breast around his throat he fastened a slender gold chain around his waist a belt of bleached white leather he hung a dirk at one hip and a longsword at the other in scabbards striped blackandgold drawing the dirk he tested its edge with his thumb pulled a whetstone from his belt pouch and gave it a few licks he prided himself on keeping his weapons sharp when i return i shall expect a warm room and clean rushes he warned the thralls as he drew on a pair of black gloves the silk decorated with a delicate scrollwork tracery in golden thread theon returned to the great keep through a covered stone walkway the echoes of his footsteps mingling with the ceaseless rumble of the sea below to get to the sea tower on its crooked pillar he had to cross three further bridges each narrower than the one before the last was made of rope and wood and the wet salt wind made it sway underfoot like a living thing theons heart was in his mouth by the time he was halfway across a long way below the waves threw up tall plumes of spray as they crashed against the rock as a boy he used to run across this bridge even in the black of night boys believe nothing can hurt them his doubt whispered grown men know better the door was grey wood studded with iron and theon found it barred from the inside he hammered on it with a fist and cursed when a splinter snagged the fabric of his glove the wood was damp and moldy the iron studs rusted after a moment the door was opened from within by a guard in a black iron breastplate and pothelm you are the son out of my way or youll learn who i am the man stood aside theon climbed the twisting steps to the solar he found his father seated beside a brazier beneath a robe of musty sealskins that covered him foot to chin at the sound of boots on stone the lord of the iron islands lifted his eyes to behold his last living son he was smaller than theon remembered him and so gaunt balon greyjoy had always been thin but now he looked as though the gods had put him in a cauldron and boiled every spare ounce of flesh from his bones until nothing remained but hair and skin bone thin and bone hard he was with a face that might have been chipped from flint his eyes were flinty too black and sharp but the years and the salt winds had turned his hair the grey of a winter sea flecked with whitecaps unbound it hung past the small of the back nine years is it lord balon said at last ten theon answered pulling off his torn gloves a boy they took his father said what are you now a man theon answered your blood and your heir lord balon grunted we shall see you shall theon promised ten years you say stark had you as long as i and now you come as his envoy page not his theon said lord eddard is dead beheaded by the lannister queen they are both dead stark and that robert who broke my walls with his stones i vowed id live to see them both in their graves and i have he grimaced yet the cold and the damp still make my joints ache as when they were alive so what does it serve it serves theon moved closer i bring a letter did ned stark dress you like that his father interrupted squinting up from beneath his robe was it his pleasure to garb you in velvets and silks and make you his own sweet daughter theon felt the blood rising to his face i am no mans daughter if you mislike my garb i will change it you will throwing off the furs lord balon pushed himself to his feet he was not so tall as theon remembered that bauble around your neckwas it bought with gold or iron theon touched the gold chain he had forgotten it has been so long in the old way women might decorate themselves with ornaments bought with coin but a warrior wore only the jewelry he took off the corpses of enemies slain by his own hand paying the iron price it was called you blush red as a maid theon a question was asked is it the gold price you paid or the iron the gold theon admitted his father slid his fingers under the necklace and gave it a yank so hard it was like to take theons head off had the chain not snapped first my daughter has taken an axe for a lover lord balon said i will not have my son bedeck himself like a whore he dropped the broken chain onto the brazier where it slid down among the coals it is as i feared the green lands have made you soft and the starks have made you theirs youre wrong ned stark was my gaoler but my blood is still salt and iron lord balon turned away to warm his bony hands over the brazier yet the stark pup sends you to me like a welltrained raven clutching his little message there is nothing small about the letter i bear theon said and the offer he makes is one i suggested to him this wolf king heeds your counsel does he the notion seemed to amuse lord balon he heeds me yes ive hunted with him trained with him shared meat and mead with him warred at his side i have earned his trust he looks on me as an older brother he no his father jabbed a finger at his face not here not in pyke not in my hearing you will not name him brother this son of the man who put your true brothers to the sword or have you forgotten rodrik and maron who were your own blood i forget nothing ned stark had killed neither of his brothers in truth rodrik had been slain by lord jason mallister at seagard maron crushed in the collapse of the old south tower but stark would page have done for them just as quick had the tide of battle chanced to sweep them together i remember my brothers very well theon insisted chiefly he remembered rodriks drunken cuffs and marons cruel japes and endless lies i remember when my father was a king too he took out robbs letter and thrust it forward here read it your grace lord balon broke the seal and unfolded the parchment his black eyes flicked back and forth so the boy would give me a crown again he said and all i need do is destroy his enemies his thin lips twisted in a smile by now robb is at the golden tooth theon said once it falls hell be through the hills in a day lord tywins host is at harrenhal cut off from the west the kingslayer is a captive at riverrun only ser stafford lannister and the raw green levies hes been gathering remain to oppose robb in the west ser stafford will put himself between robbs army and lannisport which means the city will be undefended when we descend on it by sea if the gods are with us even casterly rock itself may fall before the lannisters so much as realize that we are upon them lord balon grunted casterly rock has never fallen until now theon smiled and how sweet that will be his father did not return the smile so this is why robb stark sends you back to me after so long so you might win my consent to thisplanof his it is my plan not robbs theon said proudly mine as the victory will be mine and in time the crown i will lead the attack myself if it please you as my reward i would ask that you grant me casterly rock for my own seat once we have taken it from the lannisters with the rock he could hold lannisport and the golden lands of the west it would mean wealth and power such as house greyjoy had never known you reward yourself handsomely for a notion and a few lines of scribbling his father read the letter again the pup says nothing about a reward only that you speak for him and i am to listen and give him my sails and swords and in return he will give me a crown his flinty eyes lifted to meet his sons he will give me a crown he repeated his voice growing sharp a poor choice of words what is meant is what is meant is what is said the boy will give me a crown and what is given can be taken away lord balon tossed the letter onto the brazier atop the necklace the parchment curled blackened and took flame theon was aghast have you gone mad his father laid a stinging backhand across his cheek mind your tongue you are not in winterfell now and i am not robb the boy that you should speak to me so i am the greyjoy lord reaper of pyke king of salt and rock son of the sea wind and no man gives me a crown i pay the iron price i will take my crown as urron redhand did five thousand years ago theon edged backward away from the sudden fury in his fathers tone take it then he spat his cheek still tingling call yourself king of the iron islands no one will care until the wars are over and the victor looks about and spies the old fool perched off his shore with an iron crown on his head page lord balon laughed well at the least you are no craven no more than im a fool do you think i gather my ships to watch them rock at anchor i mean to carve out a kingdom with fire and sword but not from the west and not at the bidding of king robb the boy casterly rock is too strong and lord tywin too cunning by half aye we might take lannisport but we should never keep it no i hunger for a different plum not so juicy sweet to be sure yet it hangs there ripe and undefended where theon might have asked but by then he knew chapter daenerys the dothraki named the comet shierak qiya the bleeding star the old men muttered that it omened ill but daenerys targaryen had seen it first on the night she had burned khal drogo the night her dragons had awakened it is the herald of my coming she told herself as she gazed up into the night sky with wonder in her heart the gods have sent it to show me the way yet when she put the thought into words her handmaid doreah quailed that way lies the red lands khaleesi a grim place and terrible the riders say the way the comet points is the way we must go dany insisted though in truth it was the only way open to her she dare not turn north onto the vast ocean of grass they called the dothraki sea the first khalasar they met would swallow up her ragged band slaying the warriors and slaving the rest the lands of the lamb men south of the river were likewise closed to them they were too few to defend themselves even against that unwarlike folk and the lhazareen had small reason to love them she might have struck downriver for the ports at meereen and yunkai and astapor but rakharo warned her that ponos khalasar had ridden that way driving thousands of captives before them to sell in the flesh marts that festered like open sores on the shores of slavers bay why should i fear pono dany objected he was drogos ko and always spoke me gently ko pono spoke you gently ser jorah mormont said khal pono will kill you he was the first to abandon drogo ten thousand warriors went with him you have a hundred no dany thought i have four the rest are women old sick men and boys whose hair has never been braided i have the dragons she pointed out hatchlings ser jorah said one swipe from an arakh would put an end to them though porto is more like to seize them for himself your dragon eggs were more precious than rubies a living dragon is beyond price in all the world there are only three every man who sees them will want them my queen they are mine she said fiercely they had been born from her faith and her need given life by the deaths of her husband and unborn son and the maegi mirri maz duur dany had walked into the flames page as they came forth and they had drunk milk from her swollen breasts no man will take them from me while i live you will not live long should you meet khal pono nor khal jhaqo nor any of the others you must go where they do not dany had named him the first of her queensguard and when mormonts gruff counsel and the omens agreed her course was clear she called her people together and mounted her silver mare her hair had burned away in drogos pyre so her handmaids garbed her in the skin of the hrakkar drogo had slain the white lion of the dothraki sea its fearsome head made a hood to cover her naked scalp its pelt a cloak that flowed across her shoulders and down her back the creamcolored dragon sunk sharp black claws into the lions mane and coiled its tail around her arm while ser jorah took his accustomed place by her side we follow the comet dany told her khalasar once it was said no word was raised against it they had been drogos people but they were hers now the unburnt they called her and mother of dragons her word was their law they rode by night and by day took refuge from the sun beneath their tents soon enough dany learned the truth of doreahs words this was no kindly country they left a trail of dead and dying horses behind them as they went for pono jhaqo and the others had seized the best of drogos herds leaving to dany the old and the scrawny the sickly and the lame the broken animals and the illtempered it was the same with the people they are not strong she told herself so i must be their strength i must show no fear no weakness no doubt however frightened my heart when they look upon my face they must see only drogos queen she felt older than her fourteen years if ever she had truly been a girl that time was done three days into the march the first man died a toothless oldster with cloudy blue eyes he fell exhausted from his saddle and could not rise again an hour later he was done blood flies swarmed about his corpse and carried his ill luck to the living his time was past her handmaid irri declared no man should live longer than his teeth the others agreed dany bid them kill the weakest of their dying horses so the dead man might go mounted into the night lands two nights later it was an infant girl who perished her mothers anguished wailing lasted all day but there was nothing to be done the child had been too young to ride poor thing not for her the endless black grasses of the night lands she must be born again there was little forage in the red waste and less water it was a sere and desolate land of low hills and barren windswept plains the rivers they crossed were dry as dead mens bones their mounts subsisted on the tough brown devilgrass that grew in clumps at the base of rocks and dead trees dany sent outriders ranging ahead of the column but they found neither wells nor springs only bitter pools shallow and stagnant shrinking in the hot sun the deeper they rode into the waste the smaller the pools became while the distance between them grew if there were gods in this trackless wilderness of stone and sand and red clay they were hard dry gods deaf to prayers for rain wine gave out first and soon thereafter the clotted mares milk the horselords loved better than mead then their stores of flatbread and dried meat were exhausted as well their hunters found no game and only the flesh of their dead horses filled their bellies death followed death weak children wrinkled old women the sick and the stupid and the heedless the cruel land claimed them all doreah grew gaunt and page holloweyed and her soft golden hair turned brittle as straw dany hungered and thirsted with the rest of them the milk in her breasts dried up her nipples cracked and bled and the flesh fell away from her day by day until she was lean and hard as a stick yet it was her dragons she feared for her father had been slain before she was born and her splendid brother rhaegar as well her mother had died bringing her into the world while the storm screamed outside gentle ser willem darry who must have loved her after a fashion had been taken by a wasting sickness when she was very young her brother viserys khal drogo who was her sunandstars even her unborn son the gods had claimed them all they will not have my dragons dany vowed they will not the dragons were no larger than the scrawny cats she had once seen skulking along the walls of magister illyrios estate in pentos until they unfolded their wings their span was three times their length each wing a delicate fan of translucent skin gorgeously colored stretched taut between long thin bones when you looked hard you could see that most of their body was neck tail and wing such little things she thought as she fed them by hand or rather tried to feed them or t e dragons would not eat they would hiss and spit at each bloody morsel of horsemeat steam rising from their nostrils yet they would not take the food until dany recalled something viserys had told her when they were children only dragons and men eat cooked meat he had said when she had her handmaids char the horsemeat black the dragons ripped at it eagerly their heads striking like snakes so long as the meat was seared they gulped down several times their own weight every day and at last began to grow larger and stronger dany marveled at the smoothness of their scales and the heat that poured off them so palpable that on cold nights their whole bodies seemed to steam each evenfall as the khalasai set out she would choose a dragon to ride upon her shoulder irri and jhiqui carried the others in a cage of woven wood slung between their mounts and rode close behind her so dany was never out of their sight it was the only way to keep them quiescent aegons dragons were named for the gods of old valyria she told her bloodriders one morning after a long nights journey visenyas dragon was vhagar rhaenys had meraxes and aegon rode balerion the black dread it was said that vhagars breath was so hot that it could melt a knights armor and cook the man inside that meraxes swallowed horses whole and balerion his fire was as black as his scales his wings so vast that whole towns were swallowed up in their shadow when he passed overhead the dothraki looked at her hatchlings uneasily the largest of her three was shiny black his scales slashed with streaks of vivid scarlet to match his wings and horns khaleesi aggo murmured there sits balerion come again it may be as you say blood of my blood dany replied gravely but he shall have a new name for this new life i would name them all for those the gods have taken the green one shall be rhaegal for my valiant brother who died on the green banks of the trident the creamandgold i call viserion viserys was cruel and weak and frightened yet he was my brother still his dragon will do what he could not and the black beast asked ser jorah mormont the black she said is drogon page yet even as her dragons prospered her khalasar withered and died around them the land turned ever more desolate even devilgrass grew scant horses dropped in their tracks leaving so few that some of her people must trudge along on foot doreah took a fever and grew worse with every league they crossed her lips and hands broke with blood blisters her hair came out in clumps and one evenfall she lacked the strength to mount her horse jhogo said they must leave her or bind her to her saddle but dany remembered a night on the dothraki sea when the lysene girl had taught her secrets so that drogo might love her more she gave doreah water from her own skin cooled her brow with a damp cloth and held her hand until she died shivering only then would she permit the khalasar to press on they saw no sign of other travelers the dothraki began to mutter fearfully that the comet had led them to some hell dany went to ser jorah one morning as they made camp amidst a jumble of black windscoured stones are we lost she asked him does this waste have no end to it it has an end he answered wearily i have seen the maps the traders draw my queen few caravans come this way that is so yet there are great kingdoms to the east and cities full of wonders yi ti qarth asshai by the shadow will we live to see them i will not lie to you the way is harder than i dared think the knights face was grey and exhausted the wound he had taken to his hip the night he fought khal drogos bloodriders had never fully healed she could see how he grimaced when he mounted his horse and he seemed to slump in his saddle as they rode perhaps we are doomed if we press on but i know for a certainty that we are doomed if we turn back dany kissed him lightly on the cheek it heartened her to see him smile i must be strong for him as well she thought grimly a knight he may be but i am the blood of the dragon the next pool they found was scalding hot and stinking of brimstone but their skins were almost empty the dothraki cooled the water in jars and pots and drank it tepid the taste was no less foul but water was water and all of them thirsted dany looked at the horizon with despair they had lost a third of their number and still the waste stretched before them bleak and red and endless the comet mocks my hopes she thought lifting her eyes to where it scored the sky have i crossed half the world and seen the birth of dragons only to die with them in this hard hot desert she would not believe it the next day dawn broke as they were crossing a cracked and fissured plain of hard red earth dany was about to command them to make camp when her outriders came racing back at a gallop a city khaleesi they cried a city pale as the moon and lovely as a maid an hours ride no more show me she said when the city appeared before her its walls and towers shimmering white behind a veil of heat it looked so beautiful that dany was certain it must be a mirage do you know what place this might be ser jorah the exile knight gave a weary shake of the head no my queen i have never traveled this far east page the distant white walls promised rest and safety a chance to heal and grow strong and dany wanted nothing so much as to rush toward them instead she turned to her bloodriders blood of my blood go ahead of us and learn the name of this city and what manner of welcome we should expect ai khaleesi said aggo her riders were not long in returning rakharo swung down from his saddle from his medallion belt hung the great curving arakh that dany had bestowed on him when she named him bloodrider this city is dead khaleesi nameless and godless we found it the gates broken only wind and flies moving through the streets jhiqui shuddered when the gods are gone the evil ghosts feast by night such places are best shunned it is known it is known irri agreed not to me dany put her heels into her horse and showed them the way trotting beneath the shattered arch of an ancient gate and down a silent street ser jorah and her bloodriders followed and then more slowly the rest of the dothraki how long the city had been deserted she could not know but the white walls so beautiful from afar were cracked and crumbling when seen up close inside was a maze of narrow crooked alleys the buildings pressed close their facades blank chalky windowless everything was white as if the people who lived here had known nothing of color they rode past heaps of sunwashed rubble where houses had fallen in and elsewhere saw the faded scars of fire at a place where six alleys came together dany passed an empty marble plinth dothraki had visited this place before it would seem perhaps even now the missing statue stood among the other stolen gods in vaes dothrak she might have ridden past it a hundred times never knowing on her shoulder viserion hissed they made camp before the remnants of a gutted palace on a windswept plaza where devilgrass grew between the paving stones dany sent out men to search the ruins some went reluctantly yet they went and one scarred old man returned a brief time later hopping and grinning his hands overflowing with figs they were small withered things yet her people grabbed for them greedily jostling and pushing at each other stuffing the fruit into their cheeks and chewing blissfully other searchers returned with tales of other fruit trees hidden behind closed doors in secret gardens aggo showed her a courtyard overgrown with twisting vines and tiny green grapes and jhogo discovered a well where the water was pure and cold yet they found bones too the skulls of the unburied dead bleached and broken ghosts irri muttered terrible ghosts we must not stay here khaleesi this is their place i fear no ghosts dragons are more powerful than ghosts and figs are more important go with jhiqui and find me some clean sand for a bath and trouble me no more with silly talk in the coolness of her tent dany blackened horsemeat over a brazier and reflected on her choices there was food and water here to sustain them and enough grass for the horses to regain their strength how pleasant it would be to wake every day in the same place to linger among shady gardens eat figs and drink cool water as much as she might desire when irri and jhiqui returned with pots of white sand dany stripped and let them scrub her clean page your hair is coming back khaleesi jhiqui said as she scraped sand off her back dany ran a hand over the top of her head feeling the new growth dothraki men wore their hair in long oiled braids and cut them only when defeated perhaps i should do the same she thought to remind them that drogos strength lives within me now khal drogo had died with his hair uncut a boast few men could make across the tent rhaegal unfolded green wings to flap and flutter a half foot before thumping to the carpet when he landed his tail lashed back and forth in fury and he raised his head and screamed if i had wings i would want to fly too dany thought the targaryens of old had ridden upon dragonback when they went to war she tried to imagine what it would feel like to straddle a dragons neck and soar high into the air it would be like standing on a mountaintop only better the whole world would be spread out below if i flew high enough i could even see the seven kingdoms and reach up and touch the comet irri broke her reverie to tell her that ser jorah mormont was outside awaiting her pleasure send him in dany commanded sandscrubbed skin tingling she wrapped herself in the lionskin the hrakkar had been much bigger than dany so the pelt covered everything that wanted covering ive brought you a peach ser jorah said kneeling it was so small she could almost hide it in her palm and overripe too but when she took the first bite the flesh was so sweet she almost cried she ate it slowly savoring every mouthful while ser jorah told her of the tree it had been plucked from in a garden near the western wall fruit and water and shade dany said her cheeks sticky with peach juice the gods were good to bring us to this place we should rest here until we are stronger the knight urged the red lands are not kind to the weak my handmaids say there are ghosts here there are ghosts everywhere ser jorah said softly we carry them with us wherever we go yes she thought viserys khal drogo my son rhaego they are with me always tell me the name of your ghost jorah you know all of mine his face grew very still her name was lynesse your wife my second wife it pains him to speak of her dany saw but she wanted to know the truth is that all you would say of her the lion pelt slid off one shoulder and she tugged it back into place was she beautiful very beautiful ser jorah lifted his eyes from her shoulder to her face the first time i beheld her i thought she was a goddess come to earth the maid herself made flesh her birth was far above my own she was the youngest daughter of lord leyton hightower of oldtown the white bull who commanded your fathers kingsguard was her greatuncle the hightowers are an ancient family very rich and very proud and loyal dany said i remember viserys said the hightowers were among those who stayed true to my father page thats so he admitted did your fathers make the match no he said our marriage that makes a long tale and a dull one your grace i would not trouble you with it i have nowhere to go she said please as my queen commands ser jorah frowned my home you must understand that to understand the rest bear island is beautiful but remote imagine old gnarled oaks and tall pines flowering thornbushes grey stones bearded with moss little creeks running icy down steep hillsides the hall of the mormonts is built of huge logs and surrounded by an earthen palisade aside from a few crofters my people live along the coasts and fish the seas the island lies far to the north and our winters are more terrible than you can imagine khaleesi still the island suited me well enough and i never lacked for women i had my share of fishwives and crofters daughters before and after i was wed i married young to a bride of my fathers choosing a glover of deepwood motte ten years we were wed or near enough as makes no matter she was a plainfaced woman but not unkind i suppose i came to love her after a fashion though our relations were dutiful rather than passionate three times she miscarried while trying to give me an heir the last time she never recovered she died not long after dany put her hand on his and gave his fingers a squeeze i am sorry for you truly ser jorah nodded by then my father had taken the black so i was lord of bear island in my own right i had no lack of marriage offers but before i could reach a decision lord balon greyjoy rose in rebellion against the usurper and ned stark called his banners to help his friend robert the final battle was on pyke when roberts stonethrowers opened a breach in king balons wall a priest from myr was the first man through but i was not far behind for that i won my knighthood to celebrate his victory robert ordained that a tourney should be held outside lannisport it was there i saw lynesse a maid half my age she had come up from oldtown with her father to see her brothers joust i could not take my eyes off her in a fit of madness i begged her favor to wear in the tourney never dreaming she would grant my request yet she did i fight as well as any man khaleesi but i have never been a tourney knight yet with lynesses favor knotted round my arm i was a different man i won joust after joust lord jason mallister fell before me and bronze yohn royce ser ryman frey his brother ser hosteen lord whent strongboar even ser boros blount of the kingsguard i unhorsed them all in the last match i broke nine lances against jaime lannister to no result and king robert gave me the champions laurel i crowned lynesse queen of love and beauty and that very night went to her father and asked for her hand i was drunk as much on glory as on wine by rights i should have gotten a contemptuous refusal but lord leyton accepted my offer we were married there in lannisport and for a fortnight i was the happiest man in the wide world only a fortnight asked dany even i was given more happiness than that with drogo who was my sunandstars a fortnight was how long it took us to sail from lannisport back to bear island my home was a great disappointment to lynesse it was too cold too damp too far away my castle no more than a wooden page longhall we had no masques no mummer shows no balls or fairs seasons might pass without a singer ever coming to play for us and theres not a goldsmith on the island even meals became a trial my cook knew little beyond his roasts and stews and lynesse soon lost her taste for fish and venison i lived for her smiles so i sent all the way to oldtown for a new cook and brought a harper from lannisport goldsmiths jewelers dressmakers whatever she wanted i found for her but it was never enough bear island is rich in bears and trees and poor in aught else i built a fine ship for her and we sailed to lannisport and oldtown for festivals and fairs and once even to braavos where i borrowed heavily from the moneylenders it was as a tourney champion that i had won her hand and heart so i entered other tourneys for her sake but the magic was gone i never distinguished myself again and each defeat meant the loss of another charger and another suit of jousting armor which must needs be ransomed or replaced the cost could not be borne finally i insisted we return home but there matters soon grew even worse than before i could no longer pay the cook and the harper and lynesse grew wild when i spoke of pawning her jewels the rest i did things it shames me to speak of for gold so lynesse might keep her jewels her harper and her cook in the end it cost me all when i heard that eddard stark was coming to bear island i was so lost to honor that rather than stay and face his judgment i took her with me into exile nothing mattered but our love i told myself we fled to lys where i sold my ship for gold to keep us his voice was thick with grief and dany was reluctant to press him any further yet she had to know how it ended did she die there she asked him gently only to me he said in half a year my gold was gone and i was obliged to take service as a sellsword while i was fighting braavosi on the rhoyne lynesse moved into the manse of a merchant prince named tregar ormollen they say she is his chief concubine now and even his wife goes in fear of her dany was horrified do you hate her almost as much as i love her ser jorah answered pray excuse me my queen i find i am very tired she gave him leave to go but as he was lifting the flap of her tent she could not stop herself calling after him with one last question what did she look like your lady lynesse ser jorah smiled sadly why she looked a bit like you daenerys he bowed low sleep well my queen dany shivered and pulled the lionskin tight about her she looked like me it explained much that she had not truly understood he wants me she realized he loves me as he loved her not as a knight loves his queen but as a man loves a woman she tried to imagine herself in ser jorahs arms kissing him pleasuring him letting him enter her it was no good when she closed her eyes his face kept changing into drogos khal drogo had been her sunandstars her first and perhaps he must be her last the maegi mirri maz duur had sworn she should never bear a living child and what man would want a barren wife and what man could hope to rival drogo who had died with his hair uncut and rode now through the night lands the stars his khalasar she had heard the longing in ser jorahs voice when he spoke of his bear island he can never have me page but one day i can give him back his home and honor that much i can do for him no ghosts troubled her sleep that night she dreamed of drogo and the first ride they had taken together on the night they were wed in the dream it was not horses they rode but dragons the next morn she summoned her bloodriders blood of my blood she told the three of them i have need of you each of you is to choose three horses the hardiest and healthiest that remain to us load as much water and food as your mounts can bear and ride forth for me aggo shall strike southwest rakharo due south jhogo you are to follow shierak qiya on southeast what shall we seek khaleesi asked jhogo whatever there is dany answered seek for other cities living and dead seek for caravans and people seek for rivers and lakes and the great salt sea find how far this waste extends before us and what lies on the other side when i leave this place i do not mean to strike out blind again i will know where i am bound and how best to get there and so they went the bells in their hair ringing softly while dany settled down with her small band of survivors in the place they named vaes tolorro the city of bones day followed night followed day women harvested fruit from the gardens of the dead men groomed their mounts and mended saddles stirrups and shoes children wandered the twisty alleys and found old bronze coins and bits of purple glass and stone flagons with handles carved like snakes one woman was stung by a red scorpion but hers was the only death the horses began to put on some flesh dany tended ser jorahs wound herself and it began to heal rakharo was the first to return due south the red waste stretched on and on he reported until it ended on a bleak shore beside the poison water between here and there lay only swirling sand windscoured rocks and plants bristly with sharp thorns he had passed the bones of a dragon he swore so immense that he had ridden his horse through its great black jaws other than that he had seen nothing dany gave him charge of a dozen of her strongest men and set them to pulling up the plaza to get to the earth beneath if devilgrass could grow between the paving stones other grasses would grow when the stones were gone they had wells enough no lack of water given seed they could make the plaza bloom aggo was back next the southwest was barren and burnt he swore he had found the ruins of two more cities smaller than vaes tolorro but otherwise the same one was warded by a ring of skulls mounted on rusted iron spears so he dared not enter but he had explored the second for as long as he could he showed dany an iron bracelet he had found set with a uncut fire opal the size of her thumb there were scrolls as well but they were dry and crumbling and aggo had left them where they lay dany thanked him and told him to see to the repair of the gates if enemies had crossed the waste to destroy these cities in ancient days they might well come again if so we must be ready she declared jhogo was gone so long that dany feared him lost but finally when they had all but ceased to look for him he came riding up from the southeast one of the guards that aggo had posted saw him first and gave a shout and dany rushed to the walls to see for herself it was true jhogo came yet not alone behind him rode three queerly garbed strangers atop ugly humped creatures that dwarfed any horse page they drew rein before the city gates and looked up to see dany on the wall above them blood of my blood jhogo called i have been to the great city qarth and returned with three who would look on you with their own eyes dany stared down at the strangers here i stand look if that is your pleasure but first tell me your names the pale man with the blue lips replied in guttural dothraki i am pyat pree the great warlock the bald man with the jewels in his nose answered in the valyrian of the free cities i am xaro xhoan daxos of the thirteen a merchant prince of qarth the woman in the lacquered wooden mask said in the common tongue of the seven kingdoms i am quaithe of the shadow we come seeking dragons seek no more daenerys targaryen told them you have found them chapter jon whitetree the village was named on sams old maps jon did not think it much of a village four tumbledown oneroom houses of unmortared stone surrounded an empty sheepfold and a well the houses were roofed with sod the windows shuttered with ragged pieces of hide and above them loomed the pale limbs and dark red leaves of a monstrous great weirwood it was the biggest tree jon snow had ever seen the trunk near eight feet wide the branches spreading so far that the entire village was shaded beneath their canopy the size did not disturb him so much as the face the mouth especially no simple carved slash but a jagged hollow large enough to swallow a sheep those are not sheep bones though nor is that a sheeps skull in the ashes an old tree mormont sat his horse frowning old his raven agreed from his shoulder old old old and powerful jon could feel the power thoren smallwood dismounted beside the trunk dark in his plate and mail look at that face small wonder men feared them when they first came to westeros id like to take an axe to the bloody thing myself jon said my lord father believed no man could tell a lie in front of a heart tree the old gods know when men are lying my father believed the same said the old bear let me have a look at that skull page jon dismounted slung across his back in a black leather shoulder sheath was longclaw the handandahalf bastard blade the old bear had given him for saving his life a bastard sword for a bastard the men joked the hilt had been fashioned new for him adorned with a wolfshead pommel in pale stone but the blade itself was valyrian steel old and light and deadly sharp he knelt and reached a gloved hand down into the maw the inside of the hollow was red with dried sap and blackened by fire beneath the skull he saw another smaller the jaw broken off it was halfburied in ash and bits of bone when he brought the skull to mormont the old bear lifted it in both hands and stared into the empty sockets the wildlings burn their dead weve always known that now i wished id asked them why when there were still a few around to ask jon snow remembered the wight rising its eyes shining blue in the pale dead face he knew why he was certain would that bones could talk the old bear grumbled this fellow could tell us much how he died who burned him and why where the wildlings have gone he sighed the children of the forest could speak to the dead its said but i cant he tossed the skull back into the mouth of the tree where it landed with a puff of fine ash go through all these houses giant get to the top of this tree have a look ill have the hounds brought up too perchance this time the trail will be fresher his tone did not suggest that he held out much hope of the last two men went through each house to make certain nothing was missed jon was paired with dour eddison tollett a squire grey of hair and thin as a pike whom the other brothers called dolorous edd bad enough when the dead come walking he said to jon as they crossed the village now the old bear wants them talking as well no good will come of that ill warrant and whos to say the bones wouldnt lie why should death make a man truthful or even clever the dead are likely dull fellows full of tedious complaintsthe grounds too cold my gravestone should be larger why does he get more worms than i do jon had to stoop to pass through the low door within he found a packed dirt floor there were no furnishings no sign that people had lived here but for some ashes beneath the smoke hole in the roof what a dismal place to live he said i was born in a house much like this declared dolorous edd those were my enchanted years later i fell on hard times a nest of dry straw bedding filled one corner of the room edd looked at it with longing id give all the gold in casterly rock to sleep in a bed again you call that a bed if its softer than the ground and has a roof over it i call it a bed dolorous edd sniffed the air i smell dung the smell was very faint old dung said jon the house felt as though it had been empty for some time kneeling he searched through the straw with his hands to see if anything had been concealed beneath then made a round of the walls it did not take very long theres nothing here nothing was what he had expected whitetree was the fourth village they had passed and it had been the same in all of them the people were gone vanished with their scant possessions and whatever animals they may have had none of the villages showed any signs of having been attacked they were page simply empty what do you think happened to them all jon asked something worse than we can imagine suggested dolorous edd well i might be able to imagine it but id sooner not bad enough to know youre going to come to some awful end without thinking about it aforetime two of the hounds were sniffing around the door as they reemerged other dogs ranged through the village chett was cursing them loudly his voice thick with the anger he never seemed to put aside the light filtering through the red leaves of the weirwood made the boils on his face look even more inflamed than usual when he saw jon his eyes narrowed there was no love lost between them the other houses had yielded no wisdom gone cried mormonts raven flapping up into the weirwood to perch above them gone gone gone there were wildlings at whitetree only a year ago thoren smallwood looked more a lord than mormont did clad in ser jaremy rykkers gleaming black mail and embossed breastplate his heavy cloak was richly trimmed with sable and clasped with the crossed hammers of the rykkers wrought in silver ser jaremys cloak once but the wight had claimed ser jaremy and the nights watch wasted nothing a year ago robert was king and the realm was at peace declared jarman buckwell the square stolid man who commanded the scouts much can change in a years time one thing hasnt changed ser mallador locke insisted fewer wildlings means fewer worries i wont mourn whatevers become of them raiders and murderers the lot of them jon heard a rustling from the red leaves above two branches parted and he glimpsed a little man moving from limb to limb as easily as a squirrel bedwyck stood no more than five feet tall but the grey streaks in his hair showed his age the other rangers called him giant he sat in a fork of the tree over their heads and said theres water to the north a lake might be a few flint hills rising to the west not very high nothing else to see my lords we might camp here tonight smallwood suggested the old bear glanced up searching for a glimpse of sky through the pale limbs and red leaves of the weirwood no he declared giant how much daylight remains to us three hours my lord well press on north mormont decided if we reach this lake we can make camp by the shore perchance catch a few fish jon fetch me paper its past time i wrote maester aemon jon found parchment quill and ink in his saddlebag and brought them to the lord commander at whitetree mormont scrawled the fourth village all empty the wildlings are gone find tarly and see that he gets this on its way he said as he handed jon the message when he whistled his raven came flapping down to land on his horses head corn the raven suggested bobbing the horse whickered jon mounted his garron wheeled him about and trotted off beyond the shade of the great weirwood the men of the nights watch stood beneath lesser trees tending their horses chewing strips of salt beef pissing scratching and talking when the command was given to move out again the talk died and they page climbed back into their saddles jarman buckwells scouts rode out first with the vanguard under thoren smallwood heading the column proper then came the old bear with the main force ser mallador locke with the baggage train and packhorses and finally ser ottyn wythers and the rear guard two hundred men all told with half again as many mounts by day they followed game trails and streambeds the rangers roads that led them ever deeper into the wilderness of leaf and root at night they camped beneath a starry sky and gazed up at the comet the black brothers had left castle black in good spirits joking and trading tales but of late the brooding silence of the wood seemed to have sombered them all jests had grown fewer and tempers shorter no one would admit to being afraidthey were men of the nights watch after allbut jon could feel the unease four empty villages no wildlings anywhere even the game seemingly fled the haunted forest had never seemed more haunted even veteran rangers agreed as he rode jon peeled off his glove to air his burned fingers ugly things he remembered suddenly how he used to muss aryas hair his little stick of a sister he wondered how she was faring it made him a little sad to think that he might never muss her hair again he began to flex his hand opening and closing the fingers if he let his sword hand stiffen and grow clumsy it well might be the end of him he knew a man needed his sword beyond the wall jon found samwell tarly with the other stewards watering his horses he had three to tend his own mount and two packhorses each bearing a large wireandwicker cage full of ravens the birds flapped their wings at jons approach and screamed at him through the bars a few shrieks sounded suspiciously like words have you been teaching them to talk he asked sam a few words three of them can say snow one bird croaking my name was bad enough said jon and snows nothing a black brother wants to hear about snow often meant death in the north was there anything in whitetree bones ashes and empty houses jon handed sam the roll of parchment the old bear wants word sent back to aemon sam took a bird from one of the cages stroked its feathers attached the message and said fly home now brave one home the raven quorked something unintelligible back at him and sam tossed it into the air flapping it beat its way skyward through the trees i wish he could carry me with him still well said sam yes but im not as frightened as i was truly the first night every time i heard someone getting up to make water i thought it was wildlings creeping in to slit my throat i was afraid that if i closed my eyes i might never open them again only well dawn came after all he managed a wan smile i may be craven but im not stupid im sore and my back aches from riding and from sleeping on the ground but im hardly scared at all look he held out a hand for jon to see how steady it was ive been working on my maps the world is strange jon thought two hundred brave men had left the wall and the only one who was not growing more fearful was sam the selfconfessed coward well make a ranger of you yet he joked next thing youll want to be an outrider like grenn shall i speak to the old bear page dont you dare sam pulled up the hood of his enormous black cloak and clambered awkwardly back onto his horse it was a plow horse big and slow and clumsy but better able to bear his weight than the little garrons the rangers rode i had hoped we might stay the night in the village he said wistfully it would be nice to sleep under a roof again too few roofs for all of us jon mounted again gave sam a parting smile and rode off the column was well under way so he swung wide around the village to avoid the worst of the congestion he had seen enough of whitetree ghost emerged from the undergrowth so suddenly that the garron shied and reared the white wolf hunted well away from the line of march but he was not having much better fortune than the foragers smallwood sent out after game the woods were as empty as the villages dywen had told him one night around the fire were a large party jon had said the games probably been frightened away by all the noise we make on the march frightened away by something no doubt dywen said once the horse had settled ghost loped along easily beside him jon caught up to mormont as he was wending his way around a hawthorn thicket is the bird away the old bear asked yes my lord sam is teaching them to talk the old bear snorted hell regret that damned things make a lot of noise but they never say a thing worth hearing they rode in silence until jon said if my uncle found all these villages empty as well he would have made it his purpose to learn why lord mormont finished for him and it may well be someone or something did not want that known well well be three hundred when qhorin joins us whatever enemy waits out here will not find us so easy to deal with we will find them jon i promise you or they will find us thought jon chapter arya the river was a bluegreen ribbon shining in the morning sun reeds grew thick in the shallows along the banks and arya saw a water snake skimming across the surface ripples spreading out behind it as it went overhead a hawk flew in lazy circles it seemed a peaceful place until koss spotted the dead man there in the reeds he pointed and arya saw it the body of a soldier shapeless and swollen his sodden green cloak had hung up on a rotted log and a school of tiny silver fishes were nibbling at his face i told you there was bodies page lommy announced i could taste them in that water when yoren saw the corpse he spat dobber see if hes got anything worth the taking mail knife a bit o coin what have you he spurred his gelding and rode out into the river but the horse struggled in the soft mud and beyond the reeds the water deepened yoren rode back angry his horse covered in brown slime up to the knees we wont be crossing here koss youll come with me upriver look for a ford woth gerren you go downstream the rest o you wait here put a guard out dobber found a leather purse in the dead mans belt inside were four coppers and a little hank of blond hair tied up with a red ribbon lommy and tarber stripped naked and went wading and lommy scooped up handfuls of slimy mud and threw them at hot pie shouting mud pie mud pie in the back of their wagon rorge cursed and threatened and told them to unchain him while yoren was gone but no one paid him any mind kurz caught a fish with his bare hands arya saw how he did it standing over a shallow pool calm as still water his hand darting out quick as a snake when the fish swam near it didnt look as hard as catching cats fish didnt have claws it was midday when the others returned woth reported a wooden bridge half a mile downstream but someone had burned it up yoren peeled a sourleaf off the bale might be we could swim the horses over maybe the donkeys but theres no way well get those wagons across and theres smoke to the north and west more fires could be this side o the rivers the place we want to be he picked up a long stick and drew a circle in the mud a line trailing down from it thats gods eye with the river flowing south were here he poked a hole beside the line of the river under the circle we cant go round west of the lake like i thought east takes us back to the kingsroad he moved the stick up to where the line and circle met near as i recall theres a town here the holdfasts stone and theres a lordling got his seat there too just a towerhouse but hell have a guard might be a knight or two we follow the river north should be there before dark theyll have boats so i mean to sell all we got and hire us one he drew the stick up through the circle of the lake from bottom to top gods be good well find a wind and sail across the gods eye to harrentown he thrust the point down at the top of the circle we can buy new mounts there or else take shelter at harrenhal thats lady whents seat and shes always been a friend o the watch hot pies eyes got wide theres ghosts in harrenhal yoren spat theres for your ghosts he tossed the stick down in the mud mount up arya was remembering the stories old nan used to tell of harrenhal evil king harren had walled himself up inside so aegon unleashed his dragons and turned the castle into a pyre nan said that fiery spirits still haunted the blackened towers sometimes men went to sleep safe in their beds and were found dead in the morning all burnt up arya didnt really believe that and anyhow it had all happened a long time ago hot pie was being silly it wouldnt be ghosts at harrenhal it would be knights arya could reveal herself to lady whent and the knights would escort her home and keep her safe that was what knights did they kept you safe especially women maybe lady whent would even help the crying girl the river track was no kingsroad yet it was not half bad for what it was and for once the wagons rolled along smartly they saw the first house an hour shy of evenfall a snug little thatchroofed cottage surrounded by fields of wheat yoren rode out ahead hallooing but got no answer dead might be or hiding dobber rey with me the three men went into the cottage pots is gone no sign o any coin laid by yoren muttered when they page returned no animals run most like might be we met em on the kingsroad at least the house and field had not been burned and there were no corpses about tarber found a garden out back and they pulled some onions and radishes and filled a sack with cabbages before they went on their way a little farther up the road they glimpsed a foresters cabin surrounded by old trees and neatly stacked logs ready for the splitting and later a ramshackle stilthouse leaning over the river on poles ten feet tall both deserted they passed more fields wheat and corn and barley ripening in the sun but here there were no men sitting in trees nor walking the rows with scythes finally the town came into view a cluster of white houses spread out around the walls of the holdfast a big sept with a shingled wooden roof the lords towerhouse sitting on a small rise to the west and no sign of any people anywhere yoren sat on his horse frowning through his tangle of beard dont like it he said but there it is well go have us a look a careful look see maybe theres some folk hiding might be they left a boat behind or some weapons we can use the black brother left ten to guard the wagons and the whimpery little girl and split the rest of them into four groups of five to search the town keep your eyes and ears open he warned them before he rode off to the towerhouse to see if there was any sign of the lordling or his guards arya found herself with gendry hot pie and lommy squat kettlebellied woth had pulled an oar on a galley once which made him the next best thing they had to a sailor so yoren told him to take them down to the lakefront and see if they could find a boat as they rode between the silent white houses gooseprickles crawled up aryas arms this empty town frightened her almost as much as the burnt holdfast where theyd found the crying girl and the onearmed woman why would people run off and leave their homes and everything what could scare them so much the sun was low to the west and the houses cast long dark shadows a sudden clap of sound made arya reach for needle but it was only a shutter banging in the wind after the open river shore the closeness of the town unnerved her when she glimpsed the lake ahead between houses and trees arya put her knees into her horse galloping past woth and gendry she burst out onto the grassy sward beside the pebbled shore the setting sun made the tranquil surface of the water shimmer like a sheet of beaten copper it was the biggest lake she had ever seen with no hint of a far shore she saw a rambling inn to her left built out over the water on heavy wooden pilings to her right a long pier jutted into the lake and there were other docks farther east wooden fingers reaching out from the town but the only boat in view was an upsidedown rowboat abandoned on the rocks beneath the inn its bottom thoroughly rotted out theyre gone arya said dejected what would they do now theres an inn lommy said when the others rode up do you think they left any food or ale lets go see hot pie suggested never you mind about no inn snapped woth yoren said were to find a boat they took the boats somehow arya knew it was true they could search the whole town and theyd find no more than the upsidedown rowboat despondent she climbed off her horse and knelt by the lake the water lapped softly around her legs a few lantern bugs were coming out their little lights blinking on and off the green water was warm as tears but there was no salt in it it tasted of summer page and mud and growing things arya plunged her face down into it to wash off the dust and dirt and sweat of the day when she leaned back the trickles ran down the back of her neck and under her collar they felt good she wished she could take off her clothes and swim gliding through the warm water like an skinny pink otter maybe she could swim all the way to winterfell woth was shouting at her to help search so she did peering into boathouses and sheds while her horse grazed along the shore they found some sails some nails buckets of tar gone hard and a mother cat with a litter of newborn kittens but no boats the town was as dark as any forest when yoren and the others reappeared towers empty he said lords gone off to fight maybe or to get his smallfolk to safety no telling not a horse or pig left in town but well eat saw a goose running loose and some chickens and theres good fish in the gods eye the boats are gone arya reported we could patch the bottom of that rowboat said koss might do for four o us yoren said theres nails lommy pointed out and theres trees all around we could build us all boats yoren spat you know anything bout boatbuilding dyers boy lommy looked blank a raft suggested gendry anyone can build a raft and long poles for pushing yoren looked thoughtful lakes too deep to pole across but if we stayed to the shallows near shore itd mean leaving the wagons might be thats best ill sleep on it can we stay at the inn lommy asked well stay in the holdfast with the gates barred the old man said i like the feel o stone walls about me when i sleep arya could not keep quiet we shouldnt stay here she blurted the people didnt they all ran off even their lord arrys scared lommy announced braying laughter im not she snapped back but they were smart boy said yoren thing is the folks who lived here were at war like it or no were not nights watch takes no part so no mans our enemy and no mans our friend she thought but this time she held her tongue lommy and the rest were looking at her and she did not want to seem craven in front of them the holdfast gates were studded with iron nails within they found a pair of iron bars the size of saplings with post holes in the ground and metal brackets on the gate when they slotted the bars through the brackets they made a huge x brace it was no red keep yoren announced when theyd explored the holdfast top to bottom but it was better than most and should do for a night well enough the walls were rough unmortared stone ten feet high with a wooden catwalk inside the battlements page there was a postern gate to the north and gerren discovered a trap under the straw in the old wooden barn leading to a narrow winding tunnel he followed it a long way under the earth and came out by the lake yoren had them roll a wagon on top of the trap to make certain no one came in that way he divided them into three watches and sent tarber kurz and cutjack off to the abandoned towerhouse to keep an eye out from on high kurz had a hunting horn to sound if danger threatened they drove their wagons and animals inside and barred the gates behind them the barn was a ramshackle thing large enough to hold half the animals in the town the haven where the townfolk would shelter in times of trouble was even larger low and long and built of stone with a thatched roof koss went out the postern gate and brought the goose back and two chickens as well and yoren allowed a cookfire there was a big kitchen inside the holdfast though all the pots and kettles had been taken gendry dobber and arya drew cook duty dobber told arya to pluck the fowl while gendry split wood why cant i split the wood she asked but no one listened sullenly she set to plucking a chicken while yoren sat on the end of the bench sharpening the edge of his dirk with a whetstone when the food was ready arya ate a chicken leg and a bit of onion no one talked much not even lommy gendry went off by himself afterward polishing his helm with a look on his face like he wasnt even there the crying girl whimpered and wept but when hot pie offered her a bit of goose she gobbled it down and looked for more arya drew second watch so she found a straw pallet in the haven sleep did not come easy so she borrowed yorens stone and set to honing needle syrio forel had said that a dull blade was like a lame horse hot pie squatted on the pallet beside her watching her work whered you get a good sword like that he asked when he saw the look she gave him he raised his hands defensively i never said you stole it i just wanted to know where you got it is all my brother gave it to me she muttered i never knew you had no brother arya paused to scratch under her shirt there were fleas in the straw though she couldnt see why a few more would bother her i have lots of brothers you do are they bigger than you or littler i shouldnt be talking like this yoren said i should keep my mouth shut bigger she lied they have swords too big longswords and they showed me how to kill people who bother me i was talking not bothering hot pie went off and let her alone and arya curled up on her pallet she could hear the crying girl from the far side of the haven i wish shed just be quiet why does she have to cry all the time she must have slept though she never remembered closing her eyes she dreamed a wolf was howling and the sound was so terrible that it woke her at once arya sat up on her pallet with her heart thumping hot pie wake up she scrambled to her feet woth gendry didnt you hear she pulled on a boot all around her men and boys stirred and crawled from their pallets whats wrong hot pie asked hear what gendry wanted to know arry had a bad dream someone else said page no i heard it she insisted a wolf arry has wolves in his head sneered lommy let them howl gerren said theyre out there were in here woth agreed never saw no wolf could storm a holdfast hot pie was saying i never heard nothing it was a wolf she shouted at them as she yanked on her second boot somethings wrong someones coming get up before they could hoot her down again the sound came shuddering through the nightonly it was no wolf this time it was kurz blowing his hunting horn sounding danger in a heartbeat all of them were pulling on clothes and snatching for whatever weapons they owned arya ran for the gate as the horn sounded again as she dashed past the barn biter threw himself furiously against his chains and jaqen hghar called out from the back of their wagon boy sweet boy is it war red war boy free us a man can fight boy she ignored him and plunged on by then she could hear horses and shouts beyond the wall she scrambled up onto the catwalk the parapets were a bit too high and arya a bit too short she had to wedge her toes into the holes between the stones to see over for a moment she thought the town was full of lantern bugs then she realized they were men with torches galloping between the houses she saw a roof go up flames licking at the belly of the night with hot orange tongues as the thatch caught another followed and then another and soon there were fires blazing everywhere gendry climbed up beside her wearing his helm how many arya tried to count but they were riding too fast torches spinning through the air as they flung them a hundred she said two hundred i dont know over the roar of the flames she could hear shouts theyll come for us soon there gendry said pointing a column of riders moved between the burning buildings toward the holdfast firelight glittered off metal helms and spattered their mail and plate with orange and yellow highlights one carried a banner on a tall lance she thought it was red but it was hard to tell in the night with the fires roaring all around everything seemed red or black or orange the fire leapt from one house to another arya saw a tree consumed the flames creeping across its branches until it stood against the night in robes of living orange everyone was awake now manning the catwalks or struggling with the frightened animals below she could hear yoren shouting commands something bumped against her leg and she glanced down to discover the crying girl clutching her get away she wrenched her leg free what are you doing up here run and hide someplace you stupid she shoved the girl away the riders reined up before the gates you in the holdfast shouted a knight in a tall helm with a spiked crest open in the name of the king aye and which king is that old reysen yelled back down before woth cuffed him into silence yoren climbed the battlement beside the gate his faded black cloak tied to a wooden staff you men hold down here he shouted the townfolks gone page and who are you old man one of lord berics cravens called the knight in the spiked helm if that fat fool thoros is in there ask him how he likes these fires got no such man here yoren shouted back only some lads for the watch got no part o your war he hoisted up the staff so they could all see the color of his cloak have a look thats black for the nights watch or black for house dondarrion called the man who bore the enemy banner arya could see its colors more clearly now in the light of the burning town a golden lion on red lord berics sigil is a purple lightning bolt on a black field suddenly arya remembered the morning she had thrown the orange in sansas face and gotten juice all over her stupid ivory silk gown there had been some southron lordling at the tourney her sisters stupid friend jeyne was in love with him he had a lightning bolt on his shield and her father had sent him out to behead the hounds brother it seemed a thousand years ago now something that had happened to a different person in a different life to arya stark the hands daughter not arry the orphan boy how would arry know lords and such are you blind man yoren waved his staff back and forth making the cloak ripple you see a bloody lightning bolt by night all banners look black the knight in the spiked helm observed open or well know you for outlaws in league with the kings enemies yoren spat whos got your command i do the reflections of burning houses glimmered dully on the armor of his warhorse as the others parted to let him pass he was a stout man with a manticore on his shield and ornate scrollwork crawling across his steel breastplate through the open visor of his helm a face pale and piggy peered up ser amory lorch bannerman to lord tywin larmister of casterly rock the hand of the king the true king joffrey he had a high thin voice in his name i command you to open these gates all around them the town burned the night air was full of smoke and the drifting red embers outnumbered the stars yoren scowled dont see the need do what you want to the town its naught to me but leave us be were no foes to you look with your eyes arya wanted to shout at the men below cant they see were no lords or knights she whispered i dont think they care arry gendry whispered back and she looked at ser amorys face the way syrio had taught her to look and she saw that he was right if you are no traitors open your gates ser amory called well make certain youre telling it true and be on our way yoren was chewing sourleaf told you no one here but us you got my word on that page the knight in the spiked helm laughed the crow gives us his word you lost old man mocked one of the spearmen the walls a long way north o here i command you once more in king joffreys name to prove the loyalty you profess and open these gates said ser amory for a long moment yoren considered chewing then he spat dont think i will so be it you defy the kings command and so proclaim yourselves rebels black cloaks or no got me young boys in here yoren shouted down young boys and old men die the same ser amory raised a lanquid fist and a spear came hurtling from the firebright shadows behind yoren must have been the target but it was woth beside him who was hit the spearhead went in his throat and exploded out the back of his neck dark and wet woth grabbed at the shaft and fell boneless from the walk storm the walls and kill them all ser amory said in a bored voice more spears flew arya yanked down hot pie by the back of his tunic from outside came the rattle of armor the scrape of swords on scabbards the banging of spears on shields mingled with curses and the hoofbeats of racing horses a torch sailed spinning above their heads trailing fingers of fire as it thumped down in the dirt of the yard blades yoren shouted spread apart defend the wall wherever they hit koss urreg hold the postern lommy pull that spear out of woth and get up where he was hot pie dropped his shortsword when he tried to unsheath it arya shoved the blade back into his hand i dont know how to swordfight he said whiteeyed its easy arya said but the lie died in her throat as a hand grasped the top of the parapet she saw it by the light of the burning town so clear that it was as if time had stopped the fingers were blunt callused wiry black hairs grew between the knuckles there was dirt under the nail of the thumb fear cuts deeper than swords she remembered as the top of a pothelm loomed up behind the hand she slashed down hard and needles castleforged steel bit into the grasping fingers between the knuckles winterfell she screamed blood spurted fingers flew and the helmed face vanished as suddenly as it had appeared behind hot pie yelled arya whirled the second man was bearded and helmetless his dirk between his teeth to leave both hands free for climbing as he swung his leg over the parapet she drove her point at his eyes needle never touched him he reeled backward and fell i hope he falls on his face and cuts off his tongue watch them not me she screamed at hot pie the next time someone tried to climb their part of the wall the boy hacked at his hands with his swordshort until the man dropped away ser amory had no ladders but the holdfast walls were roughcut and unmortared easy to climb and there seemed to be no end to the foes for each one arya cut or stabbed or shoved back another was coming over the wall the knight in the spiked helm reached the rampart but yoren tangled his black banner around his spike and forced the point of his dirk through his armor while the man was fighting the cloth every time arya looked up more torches were flying trailing long tongues of flame that lingered behind her eyes she saw a gold lion on a red banner and thought of joffrey wishing he was here so she could drive needle through his sneery face when four men assaulted the gate with axes koss shot them page down with arrows one by one dobber wrestled a man off the walk and lommy smashed his head with a rock before he could rise and hooted until he saw the knife in dobbers belly and realized he wouldnt be getting up either arya jumped over a dead boy no older than jon lying with his arm cut off she didnt think shed done it but she wasnt sure she heard qyle beg for mercy before a knight with a wasp on his shield smashed his face in with a spiked mace everything smelled of blood and smoke and iron and piss but after a time it seemed like that was only one smell she never saw how the skinny man got over the wall but when he did she fell on him with gendry and hot pie gendrys sword shattered on the mans helm tearing it off his head underneath he was bald and scaredlooking with missing teeth and a speckly grey beard but even as she was feeling sorry for him she was killing him shouting winterfefl winterfell while hot pie screamed hot pie beside her as he hacked at the mans scrawny neck when the skinny man was dead gendry stole his sword and leapt down into the yard to fight some more arya looked past him and saw steel shadows running through the holdfast firelight shining off mail and blades and she knew that theyd gotten over the wall somewhere or broken through at the postern she jumped down beside gendry landing the way syrio had taught her the night rang to the clash of steel and the cries of the wounded and dying for a moment arya stood uncertain not knowing which way to go death was all around her and then yoren was there shaking her screaming in her face boy he yelled the way he always yelled it get out its done weve lost herd up all you can you and him and the others the boys you get them out now how arya said that trap he screamed under the barn quick as that he was gone off to fight sword in hand arya grabbed gendry by the arm he said go she shouted the barn the way out through the slits of his helm the bulls eyes shone with reflected fire he nodded they called hot pie down from the wall and found lommy greenhands where he lay bleeding from a spear thrust through his calf they found gerren too but he was hurt too bad to move as they were running toward the barn arya spied the crying girl sitting in the middle of the chaos surrounded by smoke and slaughter she grabbed her by the hand and pulled her to her feet as the others raced ahead the girl wouldnt walk even when slapped arya dragged her with her right hand while she held needle in the left ahead the night was a sullen red the bams on fire she thought flames were licking up its sides from where a torch had fallen on straw and she could hear the screaming of the animals trapped within hot pie stepped out of the barn arry come on lommys gone leave her if she wont come stubbornly arya dragged all the harder pulling the crying girl along hot pie scuttled back inside abandoning them but gendry came back the fire shining so bright on his polished helm that the horns seemed to glow orange he ran to them and hoisted the crying girl up over his shoulder run rushing through the barn doors was like running into a furnace the air was swirling with smoke the back wall a sheet of fire ground to roof their horses and donkeys were kicking and rearing and screaming the poor animals arya thought then she saw the wagon and the three men manacled to its bed biter was flinging himself against the chains blood running down his arms from where the irons clasped his wrists rorge screamed curses kicking at the wood boy called jaqen hghar sweet boy the open trap was only a few feet ahead but the fire was spreading fast consuming the old wood and page dry straw faster than she would have believed arya remembered the hounds horrible burned face tunnels narrow gendry shouted how do we get her through pull her arya said push her good boys kind boys called jaqen hghar coughing get these fucking chains off rorge screamed gendry ignored them you go first then her then me hurry its a long way when you split the firewood arya remembered where did you leave the axe out by the haven he spared a glance for the chained men id save the donkeys first theres no time you take her she yelled you get her out you do it the fire beat at her back with hot red wings as she fled the burning barn it felt blessedly cool outside but men were dying all around her she saw koss throw down his blade to yield and she saw them kill him where he stood smoke was everywhere there was no sign of yoren but the axe was where gendry had left it by the woodpile outside the haven as she wrenched it free a mailed hand grabbed her arm spinning arya drove the head of the axe hard between his legs she never saw his face only the dark blood seeping between the links of his hauberk going back into that barn was the hardest thing she ever did smoke was pouring out the open door like a writhing black snake and she could hear the screams of the poor animals inside donkeys and horses and men she chewed her lip and darted through the doors crouched low where the smoke wasnt quite so thick a donkey was caught in a ring of fire shrieking in terror and pain she could smell the stench of burning hair the roof was gone up too and things were falling down pieces of flaming wood and bits of straw and hay arya put a hand over her mouth and nose she couldnt see the wagon for the smoke but she could still hear biter screaming she crawled toward the sound and then a wheel was looming over her the wagon jumped and moved a half foot when biter threw himself against his chains again jaqen saw her but it was too hard to breathe let alone talk she threw the axe into the wagon rorge caught it and lifted it over his head rivers of sooty sweat pouring down his noseless face arya was running coughing she heard the steel crash through the old wood and again again an instant later came a crack as loud as thunder and the bottom of the wagon came ripping loose in an explosion of splinters arya rolled headfirst into the tunnel and dropped five feet she got dirt in her mouth but she didnt care the taste was fine the taste was mud and water and worms and life under the earth the air was cool and dark above was nothing but blood and roaring red and choking smoke and the screams of dying horses she moved her belt around so needle would not be in her way and began to crawl a dozen feet down the tunnel she heard the sound like the roar of some monstrous beast and a cloud of hot smoke and black dust came billowing up behind her smelling of hell arya held her breath and kissed the mud on the floor of the tunnel and cried for whom she could not say chapter page tyrion the queen was not disposed to wait on varys treason is vile enough she declared furiously but this is barefaced naked villainy and i do not need that mincing eunuch to tell me what must be done with villains tyrion took the letters from his sisters hand and compared them side by side there were two copies the words exactly alike though they had been written by different hands maester frenken received the first missive at castle stokeworth grand maester pycelle explained the second copy came through lord gyles littlefinger fingered his beard if stannis bothered with them its past certain every other lord in the seven kingdoms saw a copy as well i want these letters burned every one cersei declared no hint of this must reach my sons ears or my fathers i imagine fathers heard rather more than a hint by now tyrion said dryly doubtless stannis sent a bird to casterly rock and another to harrenhal as for burning the letters to what point the song is sung the wine is spilled the wench is pregnant and this is not as dire as it seems in truth cersei turned on him in greeneyed fury are you utterly witless did you read what he says the boy foffrey he calls him and he dares to accuse me of incest adultery and treason only because youre guilty it was astonishing to see how angry cersei could wax over accusations she knew perfectly well to be true if we lose the war she ought to take up mummery she has a gift for it tyrion waited until she was done and said stannis must have some pretext to justify his rebellion what did you expect him to write joffrey is my brothers trueborn son and heir but i mean to take his throne for all that i will not suffer to be called a whore why sister he never claims faime paid you tyrion made a show of glancing over the writing again there had been some niggling phrase done in the light of the lord he read a queer choice of words that pycelle cleared his throat these words often appear in letters and documents from the free cities they mean no more than let us say written in the sight of god the god of the red priests it is their usage i do believe varys told us some years past that lady selyse had taken up with a red priest littlefinger reminded them tyrion tapped the paper and now it would seem her lord husband has done the same we can use that against him urge the high septon to reveal how stannis has turned against the gods as well as his rightful king page yes yes the queen said impatiently but first we must stop this filth from spreading further the council must issue an edict any man heard speaking of incest or calling joff a bastard should lose his tongue for it a prudent measure said grand maester pycelle his chain of office clinking as he nodded a folly sighed tyrion when you tear out a mans tongue you are not proving him a liar youre only telling the world that you fear what he might say so what would you have us do his sister demanded very little let them whisper theyll grow bored with the tale soon enough any man with a thimble of sense will see it for a clumsy attempt to justify usurping the crown does stannis offer proof how could he when it never happened tyrion gave his sister his sweetest smile thats so she had to say still your grace your brother has the right of this petyr baelish steepled his fingers if we attempt to silence this talk we only lend it credence better to treat it with contempt like the pathetic lie it is and meantime fight fire with fire cersei gave him a measuring look what sort of fire a tale of somewhat the same nature perhaps but more easily believed lord stannis has spent most of his marriage apart from his wife not that i fault him id do the same were i married to lady selyse nonetheless if we put it about that her daughter is baseborn and stannis a cuckold well the smallfolk are always eager to believe the worst of their lords particularly those as stern sour and prickly proud as stannis baratheon he has never been much loved thats true cersei considered a moment so we pay him back in his own coin yes i like this who can we name as lady selyses lover she has two brothers i believe and one of her uncles has been with her on dragonstone all this time ser axell florent is her castellan loath as tyrion was to admit it littlefingers scheme had promise stannis had never been enamored of his wife but he was bristly as a hedgehog where his honor was concerned and mistrustful by nature if they could sow discord between him and his followers it could only help their cause the child has the florent ears im told littlefinger gestured languidly a trade envoy from lys once observed to me that lord stannis must love his daughter very well since hed erected hundreds of statues of her all along the walls of dragonstone my lord i had to tell him those are gargoyles he chuckled ser axell might serve for shireens father but in my experience the more bizarre and shocking a tale the more apt it is to be repeated stannis keeps an especially grotesque fool a lackwit with a tattooed face grand maester pycelle gaped at him aghast surely you do not mean to suggest that lady selyse would bring a fool into her bed youd have to be a fool to want to bed selyse florent said littlefinger doubtless patchface reminded her of stannis and the best lies contain within them nuggets of truth enough to give a listener pause as it happens this fool is utterly devoted to the girl and follows her everywhere they even look somewhat alike shireen has a mottled halffrozen face as well page pycelle was lost but that is from the greyscale that near killed her as a babe poor thing i like my tale better said littlefinger and so will the smallfolk most of them believe that if a woman eats rabbit while pregnant her child will be born with long floppy ears cersei smiled the sort of smile she customarily reserved for jaime lord petyr you are a wicked creature thank you your grace and a most accomplished liar tyrion added less warmly this one is more dangerous than i knew he reflected littlefingers greygreen eyes met the dwarfs mismatched stare with no hint of unease we all have our gifts my lord the queen was too caught up in her revenge to take note of the exchange cuckolded by a halfwit fool stannis will be laughed at in every winesink this side of the narrow sea the story should not come from us tyrion said or it will be seen for a selfserving lie which it is to be sure once more littlefinger supplied the answer whores love to gossip and as it happens i own a brothel or three and no doubt varys can plant seeds in the alehouses and potshops varys cersei said frowning where is varys i have been wondering about that myself your grace the spider spins his secret webs day and night grand maester pycelle said ominously i mistrust that one my lords and he speaks so kindly of you tyrion pushed himself off his chair as it happened he knew what the eunuch was about but it was nothing the other councillors needed to hear pray excuse me my lords other business calls cersei was instantly suspicious kings business nothing you need trouble yourself about ill be the judge of that would you spoil my surprise tyrion said im having a gift made for joffrey a little chain what does he need with another chain he has gold chains and silver more than he can wear if you think for a moment you can buy joffs love with gifts why surely i have the kings love as he has mine and this chain i believe he may one day treasure above all others the little man bowed and waddled to the door page brorm was waiting outside the council chambers to escort him back to the tower of the hand the smiths are in your audience chamber waiting your pleasure he said as they crossed the ward waiting my pleasure i like the ring of that bronn you almost sound a proper courtier next youll be kneeling fuck you dwarf thats shaes task tyrion heard lady tanda calling to him merrily from the top of the serpentine steps pretending not to notice her he waddled a bit faster see that my litter is readied ill be leaving the castle as soon as im done here two of the moon brothers had the door guard tyrion greeted them pleasantly and grimaced before starting up the stairs the climb to his bedchamber made his legs ache within he found a boy of twelve laying out clothing on the bed his squire such that he was podrick payne was so shy he was furtive tyrion had never quite gotten over the suspicion that his father had inflicted the boy on him as a joke your garb my lord the boy mumbled when tyrion entered staring down at his boots even when he worked up the courage to speak pod could never quite manage to look at you for the audience and your chain the hands chain very good help me dress the doublet was black velvet covered with golden studs in the shape of lions heads the chain a loop of solid gold hands the fingers of each clasping the wrist of the next pod brought him a cloak of crimson silk fringed in gold cut to his height on a normal man it would be no more than a half cape the hands private audience chamber was not so large as the kings nor a patch on the vastness of the throne room but tyrion liked its myrish rugs wall hangings and sense of intimacy as he entered his steward cried out tyrion lannister hand of the king he liked that too the gaggle of smiths armorers and ironmongers that bronn had collected fell to their knees he hoisted himself up into the high seat under the round golden window and bid them rise goodmen i know you are all busy so i will be succinct pod if you please the boy handed him a canvas sack tyrion yanked the drawstring and upended the bag its contents spilled onto the rug with a muffled thunk of metal on wool i had these made at the castle forge i want a thousand more just like them one of the smiths knelt to inspect the object three immense steel links twisted together a mighty chain mighty but short the dwarf replied somewhat like me i fancy one a good deal longer do you have a name they call me ironbelly mlord the smith was squat and broad plainly dressed in wool and leather but his arms were as thick as a bulls neck i want every forge in kings landing turned to making these links and joining them all other work is to be put aside i want every man who knows the art of working metal set to this task be he master journeyman or apprentice when i ride up the street of steel i want to hear hammers ringing night or day and i want a man a strong man to see that all this is done are you that man goodman ironbelly page might be i am mlord but what of the mail and swords the queen was wanting another smith spoke up her grace commanded us to make chainmail and armor swords and daggers and axes all in great numbers for arming her new gold cloaks mlord that work can wait tyrion said the chain first mlord begging your pardon her grace said those as didnt meet their numbers would have their hands crushed the anxious smith persisted smashed on their own anvils she said sweet cersei always striving to make the smallfolk love us no one will have their hands smashed you have my word on it iron is grown dear ironbelly declared and this chain will be needing much of it and coke beside for the fires lord baelish will see that you have coin as you need it tyrion promised he could count on littlefinger for that much he hoped i will command the city watch to help you find iron melt down every horseshoe in this city if you must an older man moved forward richly dressed in a damask tunic with silver fastenings and a cloak lined with foxfur he knelt to examine the great steel links tyrion had dumped on the floor my lord he announced gravely this is crude work at best there is no art to it suitable labor for common smiths no doubt for men who bend horseshoes and hammer out kettles but i am a master armorer as it please my lord this is no work for me nor my fellow masters we make swords as sharp as song armor such as a god might wear not this tyrion tilted his head to the side and gave the man a dose of his mismatched eyes what is your name master armorer salloreon as it please my lord if the kings hand will permit i should be most honored to forge him a suit of armor suitable to his house and high office two of the others sniggered but salloreon plunged ahead heedless plate and scale i think the scales gilded bright as the sun the plate enameled a deep lannister crimson i would suggest a demons head for a helm crowned with tall golden horns when you ride into battle men will shrink away in fear a demons head tyrion thought ruefully now what does that say of me master salloreon i plan to fight the rest of my battles from this chair its links i need not demon horns so let me put it to you this way you will make chains or you will wear them the choice is yours he rose and took his leave with nary a backward glance bronn was waiting by the gate with his litter and an escort of mounted black ears you know where were bound tyrion told him he accepted a hand up into the litter he had done all he could to feed the hungry cityhed set several hundred carpenters to building fishing boats in place of catapults opened the kingswood to any hunter who dared to cross the river even sent gold cloaks foraging to the west and southyet he still saw accusing eyes everywhere he rode the litters curtains shielded him from that and besides gave him leisure to think as they wound their slow way down twisty shadowblack lane to the foot of aegons high hill tyrion page reflected on the events of the morning his sisters ire had led her to overlook the true significance of stannis baratheons letter without proof his accusations were nothing what mattered was that he had named himself a king and what will renly make of that they could not both sit the iron throne idly he pushed the curtain back a few inches to peer out at the streets black ears rode on both sides of him their grisly necklaces looped about their throats while bronn went in front to clear the way he watched the passersby watching him and played a little game with himself trying to sort the informers from the rest the ones who look the most suspicious are likely innocent he decided its the ones who look innocent i need to beware his destination was behind the hill of rhaenys and the streets were crowded almost an hour had passed before the litter swayed to a stop tyrion was dozing but he woke abruptly when the motion ceased rubbed the sand from his eyes and accepted bronns hand to climb down the house was two stories tall stone below and timber above a round turret rose from one corner of the structure many of the windows were leaded over the door swung an ornate lamp a globe of gilded metal and scarlet glass a brothel bronn said what do you mean to do here what does one usually do in a brothel the sellsword laughed shaes not enough she was pretty enough for a camp follower but im no longer in camp little men have big appetites and im told the girls here are fit for a king is the boy old enough not joffrey robert this house was a great favorite of his although joffrey may indeed be old enough an interesting notion that if you and the black ears care to amuse yourselves feel free but chatayas girls are costly youll find cheaper houses all along the street leave one man here wholl know where to find the others when i wish to return bronn nodded as you say the black ears were all grins inside the door a tall woman in flowing silks was waiting for him she had ebon skin and sandalwood eyes i am chataya she announced bowing deeply and you are let us not get into the habit of names names are dangerous the air smelled of some exotic spice and the floor beneath his feet displayed a mosaic of two women entwined in love you have a pleasant establishment i have labored long to make it so i am glad the hand is pleased her voice was flowing amber liquid with the accents of the distant summer isles titles can be as dangerous as names tyrion warned show me a few of your girls it will be my great delight you will find that they are all as sweet as they are beautiful and skilled in page every art of love she swept off gracefully leaving tyrion to waddle after as best he could on legs half the length of hers from behind an ornate myrish screen carved with flowers and fancies and dreaming maidens they peered unseen into a common room where an old man was playing a cheerful air on the pipes in a cushioned alcove a drunken tyroshi with a purple beard dandled a buxom young wench on his knee hed unlaced her bodice and was tilting his cup to pour a thin trickle of wine over her breasts so he might lap it off two other girls sat playing at tiles before a leaded glass window the freckled one wore a chain of blue flowers in her honeyed hair the other had skin as smooth and black as polished jet wide dark eyes small pointed breasts they dressed in flowing silks cinched at the waist with beaded belts the sunlight pouring through the colored glass outlined their sweet young bodies through the thin cloth and tyrion felt a stirring in his groin i would respectfully suggest the darkskinned girl said chataya shes young she has sixteen years my lord a good age for joffrey he thought remembering what brorm had said his first had been even younger tyrion remembered how shy shed seemed as he drew her dress up over her head the first time long dark hair and blue eyes you could drown in and he had so long ago what a wretched fool you are dwarf does she come from your home lands this girl her blood is the blood of summer my lord but my daughter was born here in kings landing his surprise must have shown on his face for chataya continued my people hold that there is no shame to be found in the pillow house in the summer isles those who are skilled at giving pleasure are greatly esteemed many highborn youths and maidens serve for a few years after their flowerings to honor the gods what do the gods have to do with it the gods made our bodies as well as our souls is it not so they give us voices so we might worship them with song they give us hands so we might build them temples and they give us desire so we might mate and worship them in that way remind me to tell the high septon said tyrion if i could pray with my cock id be much more religious he waved a hand i will gladly accept your suggestion i shall summon my daughter come the girl met him at the foot of the stairs taller than shae though not so tall as her mother she had to kneel before tyrion could kiss her my name is alayaya she said with only the slightest hint of her mothers accent come my lord she took him by the hand and drew him up two flights of stairs then down a long hall gasps and shrieks of pleasure were coming from behind one of the closed doors giggles and whispers from another tyrions cock pressed against the lacings of his breeches this could be humiliating he thought as he followed alayaya up another stair to the turret room there was only one door she led him through and closed it within the room was a great canopied bed a tall wardrobe decorated with erotic carvings and a narrow window of leaded glass in a pattern of red and yellow diamonds page you are very beautiful alayaya tyrion told her when they were alone from head to heels every part of you is lovely yet just now the part that interests me most is your tongue my lord will find my tongue well schooled when i was a girl i learned when to use it and when not that pleases me tyrion smiled so what shall we do now perchance you have some suggestion yes she said if my lord will open the wardrobe he will find what he seeks tyrion kissed her hand and climbed inside the empty wardrobe alayaya closed it after him he groped for the back panel felt it slide under his fingers and pushed it all the way aside the hollow space behind the walls was pitchblack but he fumbled until he felt metal his hand closed around the rung of a ladder he found a lower rung with his foot and started down well below street level the shaft opened onto a slanting earthen tunnel where he found varys waiting with candle in hand varys did not look at all like himself a scarred face and a stubble of dark beard showed under his spiked steel cap and he wore mail over boiled leather dirk and shortsword at his belt was chatayas to your satisfaction my lord almost too much so admitted tyrion youre certain this woman can be relied on i am certain of nothing in this fickle and treacherous world my lord chataya has no cause to love the queen though and she knows that she has you to thank for ridding her of allar deem shall we go he started down the tunnel even his walk is different tyrion observed the scent of sour wine and garlic clung to varys instead of lavender i like this new garb of yours he offered as they went the work i do does not permit me to travel the streets amid a column of knights so when i leave the castle i adopt more suitable guises and thus live to serve you longer leather becomes you you ought to come like this to our next council session your sister would not approve my lord my sister would soil her smallclothes he smiled in the dark i saw no signs of any of her spies skulking after me i am pleased to hear it my lord some of your sisters hirelings are mine as well unbeknownst to her i should hate to think they had grown so sloppy as to be seen well rd hate to think i was climbing through wardrobes and suffering the pangs of frustrated lust all for naught scarcely for naught varys assured him they know you are here whether any will be bold enough to enter chatayas in the guise of patrons i cannot say but i find it best to err on the side of caution how is it a brothel happens to have a secret entrance the tunnel was dug for another kings hand whose honor would not allow him to enter such a house openly chataya has closely guarded the knowledge of its existence page and yet you knew of it little birds fly through many a dark tunnel careful the steps are steep they emerged through a trap at the back of a stable having come perhaps a distance of three blocks under rhaenyss hill a horse whickered in his stall when tyrion let the door slam shut varys blew out the candle and set it on a beam and tyrion gazed about a mule and three horses occupied the stalls he waddled over to the piebald gelding and took a look at his teeth old he said and i have my doubts about his wind he is not a mount to carry you into battle true varys replied but he will serve and attract no notice as will the others and the stableboys see and hear only the animals the eunuch took a cloak from a peg it was roughspun sunfaded and threadbare but very ample in its cut if you will permit me when he swept it over tyrions shoulders it enveloped him head to heel with a cowl that could be pulled forward to drown his face in shadows men see what they expect to see varys said as he fussed and pulled dwarfs are not so common a sight as children so a child is what they will see a boy in an old cloak on his fathers horse going about his fathers business though it would be best if you came most often by night i plan to after today at the moment though shae awaits me he had put her up in a walled manse at the far northeast corner of kings landing not far from the sea but he had not dared visit her there for fear of being followed which horse will you have tyrion shrugged this one will do well enough i shall saddle him for you varys took tack and saddle down from a peg tyrion adjusted the heavy cloak and paced restlessly you missed a lively council stannis has crowned himself it seems i know he accuses my brother and sister of incest i wonder how he came by that suspicion perhaps he read a book and looked at the color of a bastards hair as ned stark did and jon arryn before him or perhaps someone whispered it in his ear the eunuchs laugh was not his usual giggle but deeper and more throaty someone like you perchance am i suspected it was not me if it had been would you admit it no but why should i betray a secret i have kept so long it is one thing to deceive a king and quite another to hide from the cricket in the rushes and the little bird in the chimney besides the bastards were there for all to see page roberts bastards what of them he fathered eight to the best of my knowing varys said as he wrestled with the saddle their mothers were copper and honey chestnut and butter yet the babes were all black as ravens and as illomened it would seem so when joffrey myrcella and tommen slid out between your sisters thighs each as golden as the sun the truth was not hard to glimpse tyrion shook his head if she had borne only one child for her husband it would have been enough to disarm suspicion but then she would not have been cersei if you were not this whisperer who was some traitor doubtless varys tightened the cinch littlefinger i named no name tyrion let the eunuch help him mount lord varys he said from the saddle sometimes i feel as though you are the best friend i have in kings landing and sometimes i feel you are my worst enemy how odd i think quite the same of you chapter bran long before the first pale fingers of light pried apart brans shutters his eyes were open there were guests in winterfell visitors come for the harvest feast this morning they would be tilting at quintains in the yard once that prospect would have filled him with excitement but that was before not now the walders would break lances with the squires of lord manderlys escort but bran would have no part of it he must play the prince in his fathers solar listen and it may be that you will learn something of what lordship is all about maester luwin had said bran had never asked to be a prince it was knighthood he had always dreamed of bright armor and streaming banners lance and sword a warhorse between his legs why must he waste his days listening to old men speak of things he only half understood because youre broken a voice inside reminded him a lord on his cushioned chair might be crippledthe walders said their grandfather was so feeble he had to be carried everywhere in a litterbut not a knight on his destrier besides it was his duty you are your brothers heir and the stark in winterfell ser rodrik said reminding him of how robb used to sit with their lord father when his bannermen came to see him lord wyman manderly had arrived from white harbor two days past traveling by barge and litter as he was too fat to sit a horse with him had come a long tail of retainers knights squires lesser lords and ladies page heralds musicians even a juggler all aglitter with banners and surcoats in what seemed half a hundred colors bran had welcomed them to winterfell from his fathers high stone seat with the direwolves carved into the arms and afterward ser rodrik had said hed done well if that had been the end of it he would not have minded but it was only the beginning the feast makes a pleasant pretext ser rodrik explained but a man does not cross a hundred leagues for a sliver of duck and a sip of wine only those who have matters of import to set before us are like to make the journey bran gazed up at the rough stone ceiling above his head robb would tell him not to play the boy he knew he could almost hear him and their lord father as well winter is coming and you are almost a man grown bran you have a duty when hodor came bustling in smiling and humming tunelessly he found the boy resigned to his fate together they got him washed and brushed the white wool doublet today bran commanded and the silver brooch ser rodrik will want me to look lordly as much as he could bran preferred to dress himself but there were some taskspulling on breeches lacing his bootsthat vexed him they went quicker with hodors help once he had been taught to do something he did it deftly his hands were always gentle though his strength was astonishing you could have been a knight too i bet bran told him if the gods hadnt taken your wits you would have been a great knight hodor hodor blinked at him with guileless brown eyes eyes innocent of understanding yes said bran hodor he pointed on the wall beside the door hung a basket stoutly made of wicker and leather with holes cut for brans legs hodor slid his arms through the straps and cinched the wide belt tight around his chest then knelt beside the bed bran used the bars sunk into the wall to support himself as he swung the dead weight of his legs into the basket and through the holes hodor hodor said again rising the stableboy stood near seven feet tall all by himself on his back brans head almost brushed the ceiling he ducked low as they passed through the door one time hodor smelled bread baking and ran to the kitchens and bran got such a crack that maester luwin had to sew up his scalp mikken had given him a rusty old visorless helm from the armory but bran seldom troubled to wear it the walders laughed whenever they saw it on his head he rested his hands on hodors shoulders as they descended the winding stair outside the sounds of sword and shield and horse already rang through the yard it made a sweet music ill just have a look bran thought a quick look thats all the white harbor lordlings would emerge later in the morning with their knights and menatarms until then the yard belonged to their squires who ranged in age from ten to forty bran wished he were one of them so badly that his stomach hurt with the wanting two quintains had been erected in the courtyard each a stout post supporting a spinning crossbeam with a shield at one end and a padded butt at the other the shields had been painted redandgold though the lannister lions were lumpy and misshapen and already well scarred by the first boys to take a tilt at them the sight of bran in his basket drew stares from those who had not seen it before but he had learned to ignore stares at least he had a good view on hodors back he towered over everyone the walders page were mounting up he saw theyd brought fine armor up from the twins shining silver plate with enameled blue chasings big walders crest was shaped like a castle while little walder favored streamers of blue and grey silk their shields and surcoats also set them apart from each other little walder quartered the twin towers of frey with the brindled boar of his grandmothers house and the plowman of his mothers crakehall and darry respectively big walders quarterings were the treeandravens of house blackwood and the twining snakes of the paeges they must be hungry for honor bran thought as he watched them take up their lances a stark needs only the direwolf their dappled grey coursers were swift strong and beautifully trained side by side they charged the quintains both hit the shields cleanly and were well past before the padded butts came spinning around little walder struck the harder blow but bran thought big walder sat his horse better he would have given both his useless legs for the chance to ride against either little walder cast his splintered lance aside spied bran and reined up now theres an ugly horse he said of hodor hodors no horse bran said hodor said hodor big walder trotted up to join his cousin well hes not as smart as a horse thats for certain a few of the white harbor lads poked each other and laughed hodor beaming genially hodor looked from one frey to the other oblivious to their taunting hodor hodor little walders mount whickered see theyre talking to each other maybe hodor means i love you in horse you shut up frey bran could feel his color rising little walder spurred his horse closer giving hodor a bump that pushed him backward what will you do if i dont hell set his wolf on you cousin warned big walder let him i always wanted a wolfskin cloak summer would tear your fat head off bran said little walder banged a mailed fist against his breastplate does your wolf have steel teeth to bite through plate and mail enough maester luwins voice cracked through the clangor of the yard as loud as a thunderclap how much he had overheard bran could not say but it was enough to anger him clearly these threats are unseemly and ill hear no more of them is this how you behave at the twins walder frey if i want to atop his courser little walder gave luwin a sullen glare as if to say you are only a maester who are you to reproach a frey of the crossing well it is not how lady starks wards ought behave at winterfell whats at the root of this the page maester looked at each boy in turn one of you will tell me i swear or we were having a jape with hodor confessed big walder i am sorry if we offended prince bran we only meant to be amusing he at least had the grace to look abashed little walder only looked peevish and me he said i was only being amusing too the bald spot atop the maesters head had turned red bran could see if anything luwin was more angry than before a good lord comforts and protects the weak and helpless he told the freys i will not have you making hodor the butt of cruel jests do you hear me hes a goodhearted lad dutiful and obedient which is more than i can say for either of you the maester wagged a finger at little walder and you will stay out of the godswood and away from those wolves or answer for it sleeves flapping he turned on his heels stalked off a few paces and glanced back bran come lord wyman awaits hodor go with the maester bran commanded hodor said hodor his long strides caught up with the maesters furiously pumping legs on the steps of the great keep maester luwin held the door open and bran hugged hodors neck and ducked as they went through the walders he began ill hear no more of that its done maester luwin looked wornout and frayed you were right to defend hodor but you should never have been there ser rodrik and lord wyman have broken their fast already while they waited for you must i come myself to fetch you as if you were a little child no bran said ashamed im sorry i only wanted i know what you wanted maester luwin said more gently would that it could be bran do you have any questions before we begin this audience will we talk of the war you will talk of naught the sharpness was back in luwins voice you are still a child of eight almost nine eight the maester repeated firmly speak nothing but courtesies unless ser rodrik or lord wyman puts you a question bran nodded ill remember i will say nothing to ser rodrik of what passed between you and the frey boys thank you they put bran in his fathers oak chair with the grey velvet cushions behind a long plankandtrestle table ser rodrik sat on his right hand and maester luwin to his left armed with quills and inkpots and a sheaf of blank parchment to write down all that transpired bran ran a hand across the rough wood of the table and begged lord wymans pardons for being late page why no prince is ever late the lord of white harbor responded amiably those who arrive before him have come early thats all wyman manderly had a great booming laugh it was small wonder he could not sit a saddle he looked as if he outweighed most horses as windy as he was vast he began by asking winterfell to confirm the new customs officers he had appointed for white harbor the old ones had been holding back silver for kings landing rather than paying it over to the new king in the north king robb needs his own coinage as well he declared and white harbor is the very place to mint it he offered to take charge of the matter as it please the king and went from that to speak of how he had strengthened the ports defenses detailing the cost of every improvement in addition to a mint lord manderly also proposed to build robb a warfleet we have had no strength at sea for hundreds of years since brandon the burner put the torch to his fathers ships grant me the gold and within the year i will float you sufficient galleys to take dragonstone and kings landing both brans interest pricked up at talk of warships no one asked him but he thought lord wymans notion a splendid one in his minds eye he could see them already he wondered if a cripple had ever commanded a warship but ser rodrik promised only to send the proposal on to robb for his consideration while maester luwin scratched at the parchment midday came and went maester luwin sent poxy tym down to the kitchens and they dined in the solar on cheese capons and brown oatbread while tearing apart a bird with fat fingers lord wyman made polite inquiry after lady hornwood who was a cousin of his she was born a manderly you know perhaps when her grief has run its course she would like to be a manderly again eh he took a bite from a wing and smiled broadly as it happens i am a widower these past eight years past time i took another wife dont you agree my lords a man does get lonely tossing the bones aside he reached for a leg or if the lady fancies a younger lad well my son wendel is unwed as well he is off south guarding lady catelyn but no doubt he will wish to take a bride on his return a valiant boy and jolly just the man to teach her to laugh again eh he wiped a bit of grease off his chin with the sleeve of his tunic bran could hear the distant clash of arms through the windows he cared nothing about marriages i wish i was down in the yard his lordship waited until the table had been cleared before he raised the matter of a letter he had received from lord tywin lannister who held his elder son ser wylis taken captive on the green fork he offers him back to me without ransom provided i withdraw my levies from his grace and vow to fight no more you will refuse him of course said ser rodrik have no fear on that count the lord assured them king robb has no more loyal servant than wyman manderly i would be loath to see my son languish at harrenhal any longer than he must however that is an ill place cursed they say not that i am the sort to swallow such tales but still there it is look at whats befallen this janos slynt raised up to lord of harrenhal by the queen and cast down by her brother shipped off to the wall they say i pray some equitable exchange of captives can be arranged before too very long i know wylis would not want to sit out the rest of the war gallant that son of mine and fierce as a mastiff brans shoulders were stiff from sitting in the same chair by the time the audience drew to a close and that night as he sat to supper a horn sounded to herald the arrival of another guest lady donella page hornwood brought no tail of knights and retainers only herself and six tired menatarms with a moosehead badge on their dusty orange livery we are very sorry for all you have suffered my lady bran said when she came before him to speak her words of greetings lord hornwood had been killed in the battle on the green fork their only son cut down in the whispering wood winterfell will remember that is good to know she was a pale husk of a woman every line of her face etched with grief i am very weary my lord if i might have leave to rest i should be thankful to be sure ser rodrik said there is time enough for talk on the morrow when the morrow came most of the morning was given over to talk of grains and greens and salting meat once the maesters in their citadel had proclaimed the first of autumn wise men put away a portion of each harvest though how large a portion was a matter that seemed to require much talk lady hornwood was storing a fifth of her harvest at maester luwins suggestion she vowed to increase that to a quarter boltons bastard is massing men at the dreadfort she warned them i hope he means to take them south to join his father at the twins but when i sent to ask his intent he told me that no bolton would be questioned by a woman as if he were trueborn and had a right to that name lord bolton has never acknowledged the boy so far as i know ser rodrik said i confess i do not know him few do she replied he lived with his mother until two years past when young domeric died and left bolton without an heir that was when he brought his bastard to the dreadfort the boy is a sly creature by all accounts and he has a servant who is almost as cruel as he is reek they call the man its said he never bathes they hunt together the bastard and this reek and not for deer ive heard tales things i can scarce believe even of a bolton and now that my lord husband and my sweet son have gone to the gods the bastard looks at my lands hungrily bran wanted to give the lady a hundred men to defend her rights but ser rodrik only said he may look but should he do more i promise you there will be dire retribution you will be safe enough my lady though perhaps in time when your grief is passed you may find it prudent to wed again i am past my childbearing years what beauty i had long fled she replied with a tired half smile yet men come sniffing after me as they never did when i was a maid you do not look favorably on these suitors asked luwin i shall wed again if his grace commands it lady hornwood replied but mors crowfood is a drunken brute and older than my father as for my noble cousin of manderly my lords bed is not large enough to hold one of his majesty and i am surely too small and frail to lie beneath him bran knew that men slept on top of women when they shared a bed sleeping under lord manderly would be like sleeping under a fallen horse he imagined ser rodrik gave the widow a sympathetic nod you will have other suitors my lady we shall try and find you a prospect more to your taste perhaps you need not look very far ser after she had taken her leave maester luwin smiled ser rodrik i do believe my lady fancies you page ser rodrik cleared his throat and looked uncomfortable she was very sad said bran ser rodrik nodded sad and gentle and not at all uncomely for a woman of her years for all her modesty yet a danger to the peace of your brothers realm nonetheless her bran said astonished maester luwin answered with no direct heir there are sure to be many claimants contending for the hornwood lands the tallharts flints and karstarks all have ties to house hornwood through the female line and the glovers are fostering lord haryss bastard at deepwood motte the dreadfort has no claim that i know but the lands adjoin and roose bolton is not one to overlook such a chance ser rodrik tugged at his whiskers in such cases her liege lord must find her a suitable match why cant you marry her bran asked you said she was comely and beth would have a mother the old knight put a hand on brans arm a kindly thought my prince but i am only a knight and besides too old i might hold her lands for a few years but as soon as i died lady hornwood would find herself back in the same mire and beths prospects might be perilous as well then let lord hornwoods bastard be the heir bran said thinking of his half brother jon ser rodrik said that would please the glovers and perhaps lord hornwoods shade as well but i do not think lady hornwood would love us the boy is not of her blood still said maester luwin it must be considered lady donella is past her fertile years as she said herself if not the bastard who may i be excused bran could hear the squires at their swordplay in the yard below the ring of steel on steel as you will my prince said ser rodrik you did well bran flushed with pleasure being a lord was not so tedious as he had feared and since lady hornwood had been so much briefer than lord manderly he even had a few hours of daylight left to visit with summer he liked to spend time with his wolf every day when ser rodrik and the maester allowed it no sooner had hodor entered the godswood than summer emerged from under an oak almost as if he had known they were coming bran glimpsed a lean black shape watching from the undergrowth as well shaggy he called here shaggydog to me but rickons wolf vanished as swiftly as hed appeared hodor knew brans favorite place so he took him to the edge of the pool beneath the great spread of the heart tree where lord eddard used to kneel to pray ripples were running across the surface of the water when they arrived making the reflection of the weirwood shimmer and dance there was no wind though for an instant bran was baffled and then osha exploded up out of the pool with a great splash so sudden that even summer leapt page back snarling hodor jumped away wailing hodor hodor in dismay until bran patted his shoulder to soothe his fears how can you swim in there he asked osha isnt it cold as a babe i suckled on icicles boy i like the cold osha swam to the rocks and rose dripping she was naked her skin bumpy with gooseprickles summer crept close and sniffed at her i wanted to touch the bottom i never knew there was a bottom might be there isnt she grinned what are you staring at boy never seen a woman before i have so bran had bathed with his sisters hundreds of times and hed seen serving women in the hot pools too osha looked different though hard and sharp instead of soft and curvy her legs were all sinew her breasts flat as two empty purses youve got a lot of scars every one hard earned she picked up her brown shift shook some leaves off of it and pulled it down over her head fighting giants osha claimed there were still giants beyond the wall one day maybe it even see one fighting men she belted herself with a length of rope black crows oft as not killed me one too she said shaking out her hair it had grown since shed come to winterfell well down past her ears she looked softer than the woman who had once tried to rob and kill him in the wolfswood heard some yattering in the kitchen today about you and them freys who what did they say she gave him a sour grin that its a fool boy who mocks a giant and a mad world when a cripple has to defend him hodor never knew they were mocking him bran said anyhow he never fights he remembered once when he was little going to the market square with his mother and septa mordane they brought hodor to carry for them but he had wandered away and when they found him some boys had him backed into an alley poking him with sticks hodor he kept shouting cringing and covering himself but he had never raised a hand against his tormentors septon chayle says he has a gentle spirit aye she said and hands strong enough to twist a mans head off his shoulders if he takes a mind to all the same he better watch his back around that walder him and you both the big one they call little it comes to me hes well named big outside little inside and mean down to the bones hed never dare hurt me hes scared of summer no matter what he says then might be hes not so stupid as he seems osha was always wary around the direwolves the day she was taken summer and grey wind between them had torn three wildlings to bloody pieces or might be he is and that tastes of trouble too she tied up her hair you have more of them wolf dreams no he did not like to talk about the dreams page a prince should lie better than that osha laughed well your dreams are your business mines in the kitchens and id best be getting back before gage starts to shouting and waving that big wooden spoon of his by your leave my prince she should never have talked about the wolf dreams bran thought as hodor carried him up the steps to his bedchamber he fought against sleep as long as he could but in the end it took him as it always did on this night he dreamed of the weirwood it was looking at him with its deep red eyes calling to him with its twisted wooden mouth and from its pale branches the threeeyed crow came flapping pecking at his face and crying his name in a voice as sharp as swords the blast of horns woke him bran pushed himself onto his side grateful for the reprieve he heard horses and boisterous shouting more guests have come and halfdrunk by the noise of them grasping his bars he pulled himself from the bed and over to the window seat on their banner was a giant in shattered chains that told him that these were umber men down from the northlands beyond the last river the next day two of them came together to audience the greatjons uncles blustery men in the winter of their days with beards as white as the bearskin cloaks they wore a crow had once taken mors for dead and pecked out his eye so he wore a chunk of dragonglass in its stead as old nan told the tale hed grabbed the crow in his fist and bitten its head off so they named him crowfood she would never tell bran why his gaunt brother hother was called whoresbane no sooner had they been seated than mors asked for leave to wed lady hornwood the greatjons the young wolfs strong right hand all know that to be true who better to protect the widows lands than an umber and what umber better than me lady donella is still grieving maester luwin said i have a cure for grief under my furs mors laughed ser rodrik thanked him courteously and promised to bring the matter before the lady and the king hother wanted ships theres wildlings stealing down from the north more than ive ever seen before they cross the bay of seals in little boats and wash up on our shores the crows in eastwatch are too few to stop them and they go to ground quick as weasels its longships we need aye and strong men to sail them the greatjon took too many half our harvest is gone to seed for want of arms to swing the scythes ser rodrik pulled at his whiskers you have forests of tall pine and old oak lord manderly has shipwrights and sailors in plenty together you ought to be able to float enough longships to guard both your coasts manderly mors umber snorted that great waddling sack of suet his own people mock him as lord lamprey ive heard the man can scarce walk if you stuck a sword in his belly ten thousand eels would wriggle out he is fat ser rodrik admitted but he is not stupid you will work with him or the king will know the reason why and to brans astonishment the truculent umbers agreed to do as he commanded though not without grumbling while they were sitting at audience the glover men arrived from deepwood motte and a large party of page tallharts from torrhens square galbart and robett glover had left deepwood in the hands of robetts wife but it was their steward who came to winterfell my lady begs that you excuse her absence her babes are still too young for such a journey and she was loath to leave them bran soon realized that it was the steward not lady glover who truly ruled at deepwood motte the man allowed that he was at present setting aside only a tenth of his harvest a hedge wizard had told him there would be a bountiful spirit summer before the cold set in he claimed maester luwin had a number of choice things to say about hedge wizards ser rodrik commanded the man to set aside a fifth and questioned the steward closely about lord hornwoods bastard the boy larence snow in the north all highborn bastards took the surname snow this lad was near twelve and the steward praised his wits and courage your notion about the bastard may have merit bran maester luwin said after one day you will be a good lord for winterfell i think no i wont bran knew he would never be a lord no more than he could be a knight robbs to marry some frey girl you told me so yourself and the walders say the same hell have sons and theyll be the lords of winterfell after him not me it may be so bran ser rodrik said but i was wed three times and my wives gave me daughters now only beth remains to me my brother martyn fathered four strong sons yet only jory lived to be a man when he was slain martyns line died with him when we speak of the morrow nothing is ever certain leobald tallhart had his turn the following day he spoke of weather portents and the slack wits of smallfolk and told how his nephew itched for battle benfred has raised his own company of lances boys none older than nineteen years but every one thinks hes another young wolf when i told them they were only young rabbits they laughed at me now they call themselves the wild hares and gallop about the country with rabbitskins tied to the ends of their lances singing songs of chivalry bran thought that sounded grand he remembered benfred tallhart a big bluff loud boy who had often visited winterfell with his father ser helman and had been friendly with robb and with theon greyjoy but ser rodrik was clearly displeased by what he heard if the king were in need of more men he would send for them he said instruct your nephew that he is to remain at torrhens square as his lord father commanded i will ser said leobald and only then raised the matter of lady hornwood poor thing with no husband to defend her lands nor son to inherit his own lady wife was a hornwood sister to the late lord halys doubtless they recalled an empty hall is a sad one i had a thought to send my younger son to lady donella to foster as her own beren is near ten a likely lad and her own nephew he would cheer her i am certain and perhaps he would even take the name hornwood if he were named heir suggested maester luwin so the house might continue finished leobald bran knew what to say thank you for the notion my lord he blurted out before ser rodrik could speak we will bring the matter to my brother robb oh and lady hornwood leobald seemed surprised that he had spoken im grateful my prince he said but bran saw pity in his pale blue eyes mingled perhaps with a little gladness that the cripple was after all not his son for a moment he hated the man page maester luwin liked him better though beren tallhart may well be our best answer he told them when leobald had gone by blood he is half hornwood if he takes his uncles name he will still be a boy said ser rodrik and hardpressed to hold his lands against the likes of mors umber or this bastard of roose boltons we must think on this carefully robb should have our best counsel before he makes his decision it may come down to practicalities said maester luwin which lord he most needs to court the riverlands are part of his realm he may wish to cement the alliance by wedding lady hornwood to one of the lords of the trident a blackwood perhaps or a frey lady hornwood can have one of our freys said bran she can have both of them if she likes you are not kind my prince ser rodrik chided gently neither are the waiders scowling bran stared down at the table and said nothing in the days that followed ravens arrived from other lordly houses bearing regrets the bastard of the dreadfort would not be joining them the mormonts and karstarks had all gone south with robb lord locke was too old to dare the journey lady flint was heavy with child there was sickness at widows watch finally all of the principal vassals of house stark had been heard from save for howland reed the crannogman who had not set foot outside his swamps for many a year and the cerwyns whose castle lay a half days ride from winterfell lord cerwyn was a captive of the lannisters but his son a lad of fourteen arrived one bright blustery morning at the head of two dozen lances bran was riding dancer around the yard when they came through the gate he trotted over to greet them cley cerwyn had always been a friend to bran and his brothers good morrow bran cley called out cheerfully or must i call you prince bran now only if you want cley laughed why not everyone else is a king or prince these days did stannis write winterfell as well stannis i dont know hes a king now too cley confided he says queen cersei bedded her brother so joffrey is a bastard loffrey the illborn one of the cerwyn knights growled small wonder hes faithless with the kingslayer for a father aye said another the gods hate incest look how they brought down the targaryens for a moment bran felt as though he could not breathe a giant hand was crushing his chest he felt as though he was falling and clutched desperately at dancers reins his terror must have shown on his face bran cley cerwyn said are you unwell its only another page king robb will beat him too he turned dancers head toward the stables oblivious to the puzzled stares the cerwyns gave him his blood was roaring in his ears and had he not been strapped onto his saddle he might well have fallen that night bran prayed to his fathers gods for dreamless sleep if the gods heard they mocked his hopes for the nightmare they sent was worse than any wolf dream fly or die cried the threeeyed crow as it pecked at him he wept and pleaded but the crow had no pity it put out his left eye and then his right and when he was blind in the dark it pecked at his brow driving its terrible sharp beak deep into his skull he screamed until he was certain his lungs must burst the pain was an axe splitting his head apart but when the crow wrenched out its beak all slimy with bits of bone and brain bran could see again what he saw made him gasp in fear he was clinging to a tower miles high and his fingers were slipping nails scrabbling at the stone his legs dragging him down stupid useless dead legs help me he cried a golden man appeared in the sky above him and pulled him up the things i do for love he murmured softly as he tossed him out kicking into empty air chapter tyrion i do not sleep as i did when i was younger grand maester pycelle told him by way of apology for the dawn meeting i would sooner be up though the world be dark than lie restless abed fretting on tasks undone he saidthough his heavylidded eyes made him look halfasleep as he said it in the airy chambers beneath the rookery his girl served them boiled eggs stewed plums and porridge while pycelle served the pontifications in these sad times when so many hunger i think it only fitting to keep my table spare commendable tyrion admitted breaking a large brown egg that reminded him unduly of the grand maesters bald spotted head i take a different view if there is food i eat it in case there is none on the morrow he smiled tell me are your ravens early risers as well pycelle stroked the snowy beard that flowed down his chest to be sure shall i send for quill and ink after we have eaten no need tyrion laid the letters on the table beside his porridge twin parchments tightly rolled and sealed with wax at both ends send your girl away so we can talk leave us child pycelle commanded the serving girl hurried from the room these letters now for the eyes of doran martell prince of dorne tyrion peeled the cracked shell away from his egg and took a bite it wanted salt one page letter in two copies send your swiftest birds the matter is of great import i shall dispatch them as soon as we have broken our fast dispatch them now stewed plums will keep the realm may not lord renly is leading his host up the roseroad and no one can say when lord stannis will sail from dragonstone pycelle blinked if my lord prefers he does i am here to serve the maester pushed himself ponderously to his feet his chain of office clinking softly it was a heavy thing a dozen maesters collars threaded around and through each other and ornamented with gemstones and it seemed to tyrion that the gold and silver and platinum links far outnumbered those of baser metals pycelle moved so slowly that tyrion had time to finish his egg and taste the plumsovercooked and watery to his tastebefore the sound of wings prompted him to rise he spied the raven dark in the dawn sky and turned briskly toward the maze of shelves at the far end of the room the maesters medicines made an impressive display dozens of pots sealed with wax hundreds of stoppered vials as many milkglass bottles countless jars of dried herbs each container neatly labeled in pycelles precise hand an orderly mind tyrion reflected and indeed once you puzzled out the arrangement it was easy to see that every potion had its place and such interesting things he noted sweetsleep and nightshade milk of the poppy the tears of lys powdered greycap wolfsbane and demons dance basilisk venom blindeye widows blood standing on his toes and straining upward he managed to pull a small dusty bottle off the high shelf when he read the label he smiled and slipped it up his sleeve he was back at the table peeling another egg when grand maester pycelle came creeping down the stairs it is done my lord the old man seated himself a matter like this best done promptly indeedindeed of great import you say oh yes the porridge was too thick tyrion felt and wanted butter and honey to be sure butter and honey were seldom seen in kings landing of late though lord gyles kept them well supplied in the castle half of the food they ate these days came from his lands or lady tandas rosby and stokeworth lay near the city to the north and were yet untouched by war the prince of dorne himself might i ask best not as you say pycelles curiosity was so ripe that tyrion could almost taste it mayhaps the kings council tyrion tapped his wooden spoon against the edge of the bowl the council exists to advise the king maester just so said pycelle and the king page is a boy of thirteen i speak with his voice so you do indeed the kings own hand yet your most gracious sister our queen regent she bears a great weight upon those lovely white shoulders of hers i have no wish to add to her burdens do you tyrion cocked his head and gave the grand maester an inquiring stare pycelle dropped his gaze back to his food something about tyrions mismatched greenandblack eyes made men squirm knowing that he made good use of them ah the old man muttered into his plums doubtless you have the right of it my lord it is most considerate of you to spare her this burden thats just the sort of fellow i am tyrion returned to the unsatisfactory porridge considerate cersei is my own sweet sister after all and a woman to be sure grand maester pycelle said a most uncommon woman and yet it is no small thing to tend to all the cares of the realm despite the frailty of her sex oh yes shes a frail dove just ask eddard stark im pleased you share my concern and i thank you for the hospitality of your table but a long day awaits he swung his legs out and clambered down from his chair be so good as to inform me at once should we receive a reply from dorne as you say my lord and only me ah to be sure pycelles spotted hand was clutching at his beard the way a drowning man clutches for a rope it made tyrions heart glad one he thought he waddled out into the lower bailey his stunted legs complained of the steps the sun was well up now and the castle was stirring guardsmen walked the walls and knights and menatarms were training with blunted weapons nearby brorm sat on the lip of a well a pair of comely serving girls sauntered past carrying a wicker basket of rushes between them but the sellsword never looked brorm i despair of you tyrion gestured at the wenches with sweet sights like that before you all you see is a gaggle of louts raising a clangor there are a hundred whorehouses in this city where a clipped copper will buy me all the cunt i want brorm answered but one day my life may hang on how close ive watched your louts he stood whos the boy in the checkered blue surcoat with the three eyes on his shield some hedge knight tallad he names himself why bronn pushed a fall of hair from his eyes hes the best of them but watch him he falls into a rhythm delivering the same strokes in the same order each time he attacks he grinned that will be the death of him the day he faces me hes pledged to joffrey hes not like to face you they set off across the bailey brorm matching his long stride to tyrions short one these days the sellsword was looking almost respectable his dark hair was washed and brushed he was freshly shaved and he wore the black breastplate of an officer of the page city watch from his shoulders trailed a cloak of lannister crimson patterned with golden hands tyrion had made him a gift of it when he namedhim captain of his personal guard how many supplicants do we have today he inquired thirty odd answered brorm most with complaints or wanting something as ever your pet was back he groaned lady tanda her page she invites you to sup with her again theres to be a haunch of venison she says a brace of stuffed geese sauced with mulberries and her daughter tyrion finished sourly since the hour he had arrived in the red keep lady tanda had been stalking him armed with a neverending arsenal of lamprey pies wild boars and savory cream stews somehow she had gotten the notion that a dwarf lordling would be the perfect consort for her daughter lollys a large soft dimwitted girl who rumor said was still a maid at thirtyandthree send her my regrets no taste for stuffed goose bronn grinned evilly perhaps you should eat the goose and marry the maid or better still send shagga shaggas more like to eat the maid and marry the goose observed bronn anyway lollys outweighs him there is that tyrion admitted as they passed under the shadow of a covered walkway between two towers who else wants me the sellsword grew more serious theres a moneylender from braavos holding fancy papers and the like requests to see the king about payment on some loan as if joff could count past twenty send the man to littlefinger hell find a way to put him off next a lordling down from the trident says your fathers men burned his keep raped his wife and killed all his peasants i believe they call that war tyrion smelled gregor cleganes work or that of ser amory lorch or his fathers other pet hellhound the qohorik what does he want of joffrey new peasants bronn said he walked all this way to sing how loyal he is and beg for recompense ill make time for him on the morrow whether truly loyal or merely desperate a compliant river lord might have his uses see that hes given a comfortable chamber and a hot meal send him a new pair of boots as well good ones courtesy of king joffrey a show of generosity never hurt brorm gave a curt nod theres also a great gaggle of bakers butchers and greengrocers clamoring to be heard i told them last time i have nothing to give them only a thin trickle of food was coming into kings landing most of it earmarked for castle and garrison prices had risen sickeningly high on greens roots flour and fruit and tyrion did not want to think about what sorts of flesh might be going into the kettles page of the potshops down in flea bottom fish he hoped they still had the river and the sea at least until lord stannis sailed they want protection last night a baker was roasted in his own oven the mob claimed he charged too much for bread did he hes not apt to deny it they didnt eat him did they not that ive heard next time they will tyrion said grimly i give them what protection i can the gold cloaks they claim there were gold cloaks in the mob brorm said theyre demanding to speak to the king himself fools tyrion had sent them off with regrets his nephew would send them off with whips and spears he was halftempted to allow it but no he dare not soon or late some enemy would march on kings landing and the last thing he wanted was willing traitors within the city walls tell them king joffrey shares their fears and will do all he can for them they want bread not promises if i give them bread today on the morrow ill have twice as many at the gates who else a black brother down from the wall the steward says he brought some rotted hand in a jar tyrion smiled wanly im surprised no one ate it i suppose i ought to see him its not yoren perchance no some knight thorne ser alliser thorne of all the black brothers hed met on the wall tyrion lannister had liked ser alliser thorne the least a bitter meanspirited man with too great a sense of his own worth come to think on it i dont believe i care to see ser alliser just now find him a snug cell where no one has changed the rushes in a year and let his hand rot a little more bronn snorted laughter and went his way while tyrion struggled up the serpentine steps as he limped across the outer yard he heard the portcullis rattling up his sister and a large party were waiting by the main gate mounted on her white palfrey cersei towered high above him a goddess in green brother she called out not warmly the queen had not been pleased by the way hed dealt with janos slynt your grace tyrion bowed politely you look lovely this morning her crown was gold her cloak ermine her retinue sat their mounts behind her ser boros blount of the kingsguard wearing white scale page and his favorite scowl ser balon swann bow slung from his silverinlay saddle lord gyles rosby his wheezing cough worse than ever hallyne the pyromancer of the alchemists guild and the queens newest favorite their cousin ser lancel lannister her late husbands squire upjumped to knight at his widows insistence vylarr and twenty guardsmen rode escort where are you bound this day sister tyrion asked im making a round of the gates to inspect the new scorpions and spitfires i would not have it thought that all of us are as indifferent to the citys defense as you seem to be cersei fixed him with those clear green eyes of hers beautiful even in their contempt i am informed that renly baratheon has marched from highgarden he is making his way up the roseroad with all his strength behind him varys gave me the same report he could be here by the full moon not at his present leisurely pace tyrion assured her he feasts every night in a different castle and holds court at every crossroads he passes and every day more men rally to his banners his host is now said to be a hundred thousand strong that seems rather high he has the power of storms end and highgarden behind him you little fool cersei snapped down at him all the tyrell bannermen but for the redwynes and you have me to thank for that so long as i hold those poxy twins of his lord paxter will squat on the arbor and count himself fortunate to be out of it a pity you let the knight of flowers slip through your pretty fingers still renly has other concerns besides us our father at harrenhal robb stark at riverrun were i he i would do much as he is doing make my progress flaunt my power for the realm to see watch wait let my rivals contend while i bide my own sweet time if stark defeats us the south will fall into renlys hands like a windfall from the gods and hell not have lost a man and if it goes the other way he can descend on us while we are weakened cersei was not appeased i want you to make father bring his army to kings landing where it will serve no purpose but to make you feel safe when have i ever been able to make father do anything she ignored the question and when do you plan to free jaime hes worth a hundred of you tyrion grinned crookedly dont tell lady stark i beg you we dont have a hundred of me to trade father must have been mad to send you youre worse than useless the queen jerked on her reins and wheeled her palfrey around she rode out the gate at a brisk trot ermine cloak streaming behind her her retinue hastened after in truth renly baratheon did not frighten tyrion half so much as his brother stannis did renly was beloved of the commons but he had never before led men in war stannis was otherwise hard cold page inexorable if only they had some way of knowing what was happening on dragonstone but not one of the fisherfolk he had paid to spy out the island had ever returned and even the informers the eunuch claimed to have placed in stanniss household had been ominously silent the striped hulls of lysene war galleys had been seen offshore though and varys had reports from myr of sellsail captains taking service with dragonstone ff stannis attacks by sea while his brother renly storms the gates theyll soon be mounting foffreys head on a spike worse mine will be beside him a depressing thought he ought to make plans to get shae safely out of the city should the worst seem likely podrick payne stood at the door of his solar studying the floor hes inside he announced to tyrions belt buckle your solar my lord sorry tyrion sighed look at me pod it unnerves me when you talk to my codpiece especially when im not wearing one who is inside my solar lord littlefinger podrick managed a quick look at his face then hastily dropped his eyes i meant lord petyr lord baelish the master of coin you make him sound a crowd the boy hunched down as if struck making tyrion feel absurdly guilty lord petyr was seated on his window seat languid and elegant in a plush plumcolored doublet and a yellow satin cape one gloved hand resting on his knee the king is fighting hares with a crossbow he said the hares are winning come see tyrion had to stand on his toes to get a look a dead hare lay on the ground below another long ears twitching was about to expire from the bolt in his side spent quarrels lay strewn across the hardpacked earth like straws scattered by a storm now joff shouted the gamesman released the hare he was holding and he went bounding off joffrey jerked the trigger on the crossbow the bolt missed by two feet the hare stood on his hind legs and twitched his nose at the king cursing joff spun the wheel to winch back his string but the animal was gone before he was loaded another the gamesman reached into the hutch this one made a brown streak against the stones while joffreys hurried shot almost took ser preston in the groin littlefinger turned away boy are you fond of potted hare he asked podrick payne pod stared at the visitors boots lovely things of reddyed leather ornamented with black scrollwork to eat my lord invest in pots littlefinger advised hares will soon overrun the castle well be eating hare thrice a day better than rats on a skewer said tyrion pod leave us unless lord petyr would care for some refreshment thank you but no littlefinger flashed his mocking smile drink with the dwarf its said and you wake up walking the wall black brings out my unhealthy pallor have no fear my lord tyrion thought its not the wall i have in mind for you he seated himself in a high chair piled with cushions and said you look very elegant today my lord page im wounded i strive to look elegant every day is the doublet new it is youre most observant plum and yellow are those the colors of your house no but a man gets bored wearing the same colors day in and day out or so ive found thats a handsome knife as well is it there was mischief in littlefingers eyes he drew the knife and glanced at it casually as if he had never seen it before valyrian steel and a dragonbone hilt a trifle plain though its yours if you would like it mine tyrion gave him a long look no i think not never mine he knows the insolent wretch he knows and he knows that i know and he thinks that i cannot touch him if ever truly a man had armored himself in gold it was petyr baelish not jaime lannister jaimes famous armor was but gilded steel but littlefinger ah tyrion had learned a few things about sweet petyr to his growing disquiet ten years ago jon arryn had given him a minor sinecure in customs where lord petyr had soon distinguished himself by bringing in three times as much as any of the kings other collectors king robert had been a prodigious spender a man like petyr baelish who had a gift for rubbing two golden dragons together to breed a third was invaluable to his hand littlefingers rise had been arrowswift within three years of his coming to court he was master of coin and a member of the small council and today the crowns revenues were ten times what they had been under his beleaguered predecessor though the crowns debts had grown vast as well a master juggler was petyr baelish oh he was clever he did not simply collect the gold and lock it in a treasure vault no he paid the kings debts in promises and put the kings gold to work he bought wagons shops ships houses he bought grain when it was plentiful and sold bread when it was scarce he bought wool from the north and linen from the south and lace from lys stored it moved it dyed it sold it the golden dragons bred and multiplied and littlefinger lent them out and brought them home with hatchlings and in the process he moved his own men into place the keepers of the keys were his all four the kings counter and the kings scales were men hed named the officers in charge of all three mints harbormasters tax farmers customs sergeants wool factors toll collectors pursers wine factors nine of every ten belonged to littlefinger they were men of middling birth by and large merchants sons lesser lordlings sometimes even foreigners but judging from their results far more able than their highborn predecessors no one had ever thought to question the appointments and why should they littlefinger was no threat to anyone a clever smiling genial man everyones friend always able to find whatever gold the king or his hand required and yet of such undistinguished birth one step up from a hedge knight he was not a man to fear he had no banners to call no army of retainers no great stronghold no holdings to speak of no prospects of a great marriage page but do i dare touch him tyrion wondered even if he is a traitor he was not at all certain he could least of all now while the war raged given time he could replace littlefingers men with his own in key positions but a shout rang up from the yard ah his grace has killed a hare lord baelish observed no doubt a slow one tyrion said my lord you were fostered at riverrun ive heard it said that you grew close to the tullys you might say so the girls especially how close i had their maidenhoods is that close enough the lietyrion was fairly certain it was a liewas delivered with such an air of nonchalance that one could almost believe it could it have been catelyn stark who lied about her defloration and the dagger as well the longer he lived the more tyrion realized that nothing was simple and little was true lord hosters daughters do not love me he confessed i doubt they would listen to any proposal i might make yet coming from you the same words might fall more sweetly on their ears that would depend on the words if you mean to offer sansa in return for your brother waste someone elses time joffrey will never surrender his plaything and lady catelyn is not so great a fool as to barter the kingslayer for a slip of a girl i mean to have arya as well i have men searching searching is not finding ill keep that in mind my lord in any case it was lady lysa i hoped you might sway for her i have a sweeter offer lysa is more tractable than catelyn true but also more fearful and i understand she hates you she believes she has good reason when i was her guest in the eyrie she insisted that id murdered her husband and was not inclined to listen to denials he leaned forward if i gave her jon arryns true killer she might think more kindly of me that made littlefinger sit up true killer i confess you make me curious who do you propose it was tyrions turn to smile gifts i give my friends freely lysa arryn would need to understand that is it her friendship you require or her swords both littlefinger stroked the neat spike of his beard lysa has woes of her own clansmen raiding out of the mountains of the moon in greater numbers than ever before and better armed distressing said tyrion lannister who had armed them i could help her with that a word from me page and what would this word cost her i want lady lysa and her son to acclaim joffrey as king to swear fealty and to make war on the starks and tullys littlefinger shook his head theres the roach in your pudding lannister lysa will never send her knights against riverrun nor would i ask it we have no lack of enemies ill use her power to oppose lord renly or lord stannis should he stir from dragonstone in return i will give her justice for jon arryn and peace in the vale i will even name that appalling child of hers warden of the east as his father was before him i want to see him fly a boys voice whispered faintly in memory and to seal the bargain i will give her my niece he had the pleasure of seeing a look of genuine surprise in petyr baelishs greygreen eyes myrcella when she comes of age she can wed little lord robert until such time shell be lady lysas ward at the eyrie and what does her grace the queen think of this ploy when tyrion shrugged littlefinger burst into laughter i thought not youre a dangerous little man lannister yes i could sing this song to lysa again the sly smile the mischief in his glance if i cared to tyrion nodded waiting knowing littlefinger could never abide a long silence so lord petyr continued after a pause utterly unabashed whats in your pot for me harrenhal it was interesting to watch his face lord petyrs father had been the smallest of small lords his grandfather a landless hedge knight by birth he held no more than a few stony acres on the windswept shore of the fingers harrenhal was one of the richest plums in the seven kingdoms its lands broad and rich and fertile its great castle as formidable as any in the realm and so large as to dwarf riverrun where petyr baelish had been fostered by house tully only to be brusquely expelled when he dared raise his sights to lord hosters daughter littlefinger took a moment to adjust the drape of his cape but tyrion had seen the flash of hunger in those sly cats eyes i have him he knew harrenhal is cursed lord petyr said after a moment trying to sound bored then raze it to the ground and build anew to suit yourself youll have no lack of coin i mean to make you liege lord of the trident these river lords have proven they cannot be trusted let them do you fealty for their lands even the tullys if there are any tullys left when we are done littlefinger looked like a boy who had just taken a furtive bite from a honeycomb he was trying to page watch for bees but the honey was so sweet harrenhal and all its lands and incomes he mused with a stroke youd make me one of the greatest lords in the realm not that im ungrateful my lord butwhy you served my sister well in the matter of the succession as did janos slynt on whom this same castle of harrenhal was quite recently bestowedonly to be snatched away when he was no longer of use tyrion laughed you have me my lord what can i say i need you to deliver the lady lysa i did not need janos slynt he gave a crooked shrug id sooner have you seated in harrenhal than renly seated on the iron throne what could be plainer what indeed you realize that i may need to bed lysa arryn again to get her consent to this marriage i have little doubt youll be equal to the task i once told ned stark that when you find yourself naked with an ugly woman the only thing to do is close your eyes and get on with it littlefinger steepled his fingers and gazed into tyrions mismatched eyes give me a fortnight to conclude my affairs and arrange for a ship to carry me to gulltown that will do nicely his guest rose this has been quite the pleasant morning lannister and profitable for both of us i trust he bowed his cape a swirl of yellow as he strode out the door wo thought tyrion he went up to his bedchamber to await varys who would soon be making an appearance evenfall he guessed perhaps as late as moonrise though he hoped not he hoped to visit shae tonight he was pleasantly surprised when galt of the stone crows informed him not an hour later that the powdered man was at his door you are a cruel man to make the grand maester squirm so the eunuch scolded the man cannot abide a secret is that a crow i hear calling the raven black or would you sooner not hear what ive proposed to doran martell varys giggled perhaps my little birds have told me have they indeed he wanted to hear this go on the dornishmen thus far have held aloof from these wars doran martell has called his banners but no more his hatred for house lannister is well known and it is commonly thought he will join lord renly you wish to dissuade him all this is obvious said tyrion the only puzzle is what you might have offered for his allegiance the prince is a sentimental man and he still mourns his sister elia and her sweet babe my father once told me that a lord never lets sentiment get in the way of ambition and it happens we page have an empty seat on the small council now that lord janos has taken the black a council seat is not to be despised varys admitted yet will it be enough to make a proud man forget his sisters murder why forget tyrion smiled ive promised to deliver his sisters killers alive or dead as he prefers after the war is done to be sure varys gave him a shrewd look my little birds tell me that princess elia cried a certain name when they came for her is a secret still a secret if everyone knows it in casterly rock it was common knowledge that gregor clegane had killed elia and her babe they said he had raped the princess with her sons blood and brains still on his hands this secret is your lord fathers sworn man my father would be the first to tell you that fifty thousand dornishmen are worth one rabid dog varys stroked a powdered cheek and if prince doran demands the blood of the lord who gave the command as well as the knight who did the deed robert baratheon led the rebellion all commands came from him in the end robert was not at kings landing neither was doran martell so blood for his pride a chair for his ambition gold and land that goes without saying a sweet offer yet sweets can be poisoned if i were the prince something more would i require before i should reach for this honeycomb some token of good faith some sure safeguard against betrayal varys smiled his slimiest smile which one will you give him i wonder tyrion sighed you know dont you since you put it that wayyes tommen you could scarcely offer myrcella to doran martell and lysa arryn both remind me never to play these guessing games with you again you cheat prince tornmen is a good boy if i pry him away from cersei and joffrey while hes still young he may even grow to be a good man and a good king joffrey is king and tornmen is heir should anything ill befall his grace tommen whose nature is so sweet and notably tractable page you have a suspicious mind varys i shall take that as a tribute my lord in any case prince doran will hardly be insensible of the great honor you do him very deftly done i would say but for one small flaw the dwarf laughed named cersei what avails statecraft against the love of a mother for the sweet fruit of her womb perhaps for the glory of her house and the safety of the realm the queen might be persuaded to send away tornmen or myrcella but both of them surely not what cersei does not know will never hurt me and if her grace were to discover your intentions before your plans are ripe why he said then i would know the man who told her to be my certain enemy and when varys giggled he thought three chapter sansa come to the godswood tonight if you want to go home the words were the same on the hundredth reading as theyd been on the first when sansa had discovered the folded sheet of parchment beneath her pillow she did not know how it had gotten there or who had sent it the note was unsigned unsealed and the hand unfamiliar she crushed the parchment to her chest and whispered the words to herself come to the godswood tonight if you want to go home she breathed ever so faintly what could it mean should she take it to the queen to prove that she was being good nervously she rubbed her stomach the angry purple bruise ser meryn had given her had faded to an ugly yellow but still hurt his fist had been mailed when he hit her it was her own fault she must learn to hide her feelings better so as not to anger joffrey when she heard that the imp had sent lord slynt to the wall she had forgotten herself and said i hope the others get him the king had not been pleased come to the godswood tonight if you want to go home sansa had prayed so hard could this be her answer at last a true knight sent to save her perhaps it was one of the redwyne twins or bold ser balon swann or even beric dondarrion the young lord her friend jeyne poole had loved with his redgold hair and the spray of stars on his black cloak come to the godswood tonight if you want to go home what if it was some cruel jape of joffreys like the day he had taken her up to the battlements to show her fathers head or perhaps it was some subtle snare to prove she was not loyal if she went to the godswood would she find ser ilyn payne waiting for her sitting silent under the heart tree with ice in his page hand his pale eyes watching to see if shed come come to the godswood tonight if you want to go home when the door opened she hurriedly stuffed the note under her sheet and sat on it it was her bedmaid the mousy one with the limp brown hair what do you want sansa demanded will milady be wanting a bath tonight a fire i think i feel a chill she was shivering though the day had been hot as you wish sansa watched the girl suspiciously had she seen the note had she put it under the pillow it did not seem likely she seemed a stupid girl not one youd want delivering secret notes but sansa did not know her the queen had her servants changed every fortnight to make certain none of them befriended her when a fire was blazing in the hearth sansa thanked the maid curtly and ordered her out the girl was quick to obey as ever but sansa decided there was something sly about her eyes doubtless she was scurrying off to report to the queen or maybe varys all her maids spied on her she was certain once alone she thrust the note in the flames watching the parchment curl and blacken come to the godswood tonight if you want to go home she drifted to her window below she could see a short knight in moonpale armor and a heavy white cloak pacing the drawbridge from his height it could only be ser preston greenfield the queen had given her freedom of the castle but even so he would want to know where she was going if she tried to leave maegors holdfast at this time of night what was she to tell him suddenly she was glad she had burned the note she unlaced her gown and crawled into her bed but she did not sleep was he still there she wondered how long will he wait it was so cruel to send her a note and tell her nothing the thoughts went round and round in her head if only she had someone to tell her what to do she missed septa mordane and even more jeyne poole her truest friend the septa had lost her head with the rest for the crime of serving house stark sansa did not know what had happened to jeyne who had disappeared from her rooms afterward never to be mentioned again she tried not to think of them too often yet sometimes the memories came unbidden and then it was hard to hold back the tears once in a while sansa even missed her sister by now arya was safe back in winterfell dancing and sewing playing with bran and baby rickon even riding through the winter town if she liked sansa was allowed to go riding too but only in the bailey and it got boring going round in a circle all day she was wide awake when she heard the shouting distant at first then growing louder many voices yelling together she could not make out the words and there were horses as well and pounding feet shouts of command she crept to her window and saw men running on the walls carrying spears and torches go back to your bed sansa told herself this is nothing that concerns you just some new trouble out in the city the talk at the wells had all been of troubles in the city of late people were crowding in running from the war and many had no way to live save by robbing and killing each other go to bed but when she looked the white knight was gone the bridge across the dry moat down but undefended page sansa turned away without thinking and ran to her wardrobe oh what am i doing she asked herself as she dressed this is madness she could see the lights of many torches on the curtain walls had stannis and renly come at last to kill joffrey and claim their brothers throne if so the guards would raise the drawbridge cutting off maegors holdfast from the outer castle sansa threw a plain grey cloak over her shoulders and picked up the knife she used to cut her meat ff it is some trap better that i die than let them hurt me more she told herself she hid the blade under her cloak a column of redcloaked swordsmen ran past as she slipped out into the night she waited until they were well past before she darted across the undefended drawbridge in the yard men were buckling on swordbelts and cinching the saddles of their horses she glimpsed ser preston near the stables with three others of the kingsguard white cloaks bright as the moon as they helped joffrey into his armor her breath caught in her throat when she saw the king thankfully he did not see her he was shouting for his sword and crossbow the noise receded as she moved deeper into the castle never daring to look back for fear that joffrey might be watching or worse following the serpentine steps twisted ahead striped by bars of flickering light from the narrow windows above sansa was panting by the time she reached the top she ran down a shadowy colonnade and pressed herself against a wall to catch her breath when something brushed against her leg she almost jumped out of her skin but it was only a cat a ragged black tom with a chewedoff ear the creature spit at her and leapt away by the time she reached the godswood the noises had faded to a faint rattle of steel and a distant shouting sansa pulled her cloak tighter the air was rich with the smells of earth and leaf lady would have liked this place she thought there was something wild about a godswood even here in the heart of the castle at the heart of the city you could feel the old gods watching with a thousand unseen eyes sansa had favored her mothers gods over her fathers she loved the statues the pictures in leaded glass the fragrance of burning incense the septons with their robes and crystals the magical play of the rainbows over altars inlaid with motherofpearl and onyx and lapis lazuli yet she could not deny that the godswood had a certain power too especially by night help me she prayed send me a friend a true knight to champion me she moved from tree to tree feeling the roughness of the bark beneath her fingers leaves brushed at her cheeks had she come too late he would not have left so soon would he or had he even been here dare she risk calling out it seemed so hushed and still here i feared you would not come child sansa whirled a man stepped out of the shadows heavyset thick of neck shambling he wore a dark grey robe with the cowl pulled forward but when a thin sliver of moonlight touched his cheek she knew him at once by the blotchy skin and web of broken veins beneath ser dontos she breathed heartbroken was it you yes my lady when he moved closer she could smell the sour stench of wine on his breath me he reached out a hand sansa shrank back dont she slid her hand under her cloak to her hidden knife what what do you want with me page only to help you dontos said as you helped me youre drunk arent you only one cup of wine to help my courage if they catch me now theyll strip the skin off my back and what will they do to me sansa found herself thinking of lady again she could smell out falsehood she could but she was dead father had killed her on account of arya she drew the knife and held it before her with both hands are you going to stab me dontos asked i will she said tell me who sent you no one sweet lady i swear it on my honor as a knight a knight joffrey had decreed that he was to be a knight no longer only a fool lower even than moon boy i prayed to the gods for a knight to come save me she said i prayed and prayed why would they send me a drunken old fool i deserve that though i know its queer but all those years i was a knight i was truly a fool and now that i am a fool i think i think i may find it in me to be a knight again sweet lady and all because of you your grace your courage you saved me not only from joffrey but from myself his voice dropped the singers say there was another fool once who was the greatest knight of all florian sansa whispered a shiver went through her sweet lady i would be your florian dontos said humbly falling to his knees before her slowly sansa lowered the knife her head seemed terribly light as if she were floating this is madness to trust myself to this drunkard but if i turn away will the chance ever come again how how would you do it get me away ser dontos raised his face to her taking you from the castle that will be the hardest once youre out there are ships that would take you home id need to find the coin and make the arrangements thats all could we go now she asked hardly daring to hope this very night no my lady i fear not first i must find a sure way to get you from the castle when the hour is ripe it will not be easy nor quick they watch me as well he licked his lips nervously will you put away your blade sansa slipped the knife beneath her cloak rise ser thank you sweet lady ser dontos lurched clumsily to his feet and brushed earth and leaves from his knees your lord father was as true a man as the realm has ever known but i stood by and let them slay him i said nothing did nothing and yet when joffrey would have slain me you spoke up lady i have never been a hero no ryam redwyne or barristan the bold ive won no tourneys no renown in page war but i was a knight once and you have helped me remember what that meant my life is a poor thing but it is yours ser dontos placed a hand on the gnarled bole of the heart tree he was shaking she saw i vow with your fathers gods as witness that i shall send you home he swore a solemn oath before the gods then i will put myself in your hands ser but how will i know when it is time to go will you send me another note ser dontos glanced about anxiously the risk is too great you must come here to the godswood as often as you can this is the safest place the only safe place nowhere else not in your chambers nor mine nor on the steps nor in the yard even if it seems we are alone the stones have ears in the red keep and only here may we talk freely only here sansa said ill remember and if i should seem cruel or mocking or indifferent when men are watching forgive me child i have a role to play and you must do the same one misstep and our heads will adorn the walls as did your fathers she nodded i understand you will need to be brave and strong and patient patient above all i will be she promised but please make it as soon as you can im afraid so am i ser dontos said smiling wanly and now you must go before you are missed you will not come with me better if we are never seen together nodding sansa took a step then spun back nervous and softly laid a kiss on his cheek her eyes closed my florian she whispered the gods heard my prayer she flew along the river walk past the small kitchen and through the pig yard her hurried footsteps lost beneath the squealing of the hogs in their pens home she thought home he is going to take me home hell keep me safe my florian the songs about florian and jonquil were her very favorites florian was homely too though not so old she was racing headlong down the serpentine steps when a man lurched out of a hidden doorway sansa caromed into him and lost her balance iron fingers caught her by the wrist before she could fall and a deep voice rasped at her its a long roll down the serpentine little bird want to kill us both his laughter was rough as a saw on stone maybe you do the hound no my lord pardons id never sansa averted her eyes but it was too late hed seen her face please youre hurting me she tried to wriggle free and whats joffs little bird doing flying down the serpentine in the black of night when she did not answer he shook her where were you the gggodswood my lord she said not daring to lie praying praying for my father and for the king praying that hed not be hurt page think im so drunk that id believe that he let go his grip on her arm swaying slightly as he stood stripes of light and darkness falling across his terrible burnt face you look almost a woman face teats and youre taller too almost ah youre still a stupid little bird arent you singing all the songs they taught you sing me a song why dont you go on sing to me some song about knights and fair maids you like knights dont you he was scaring her ttrue knights my lord true knights he mocked and im no lord no more than im a knight do i need to beat that into you clegane reeled and almost fell gods he swore too much wine do you like wine little bird rue wine a flagon of sour red dark as blood all a man needs or a woman he laughed shook his head drunk as a dog damn me you come now back to your cage little bird ill take you there keep you safe for the king the hound gave her a push oddly gentle and followed her down the steps by the time they reached the bottom he had lapsed back into a brooding silence as if he had forgotten she was there when they reached maegors holdfast she was alarmed to see that it was ser boros blount who now held the bridge his high white helm turned stiffly at the sound of their footsteps sansa flinched away from his gaze ser boros was the worst of the kingsguard an ugly man with a foul temper all scowls and jowls that one is nothing to fear girl the hound laid a heavy hand on her shoulder paint stripes on a toad he does not become a tiger ser boros lifted his visor ser where fuck your ser boros youre the knight not me im the kings dog remember the king was looking for his dog earlier the dog was drinking it was your night to shield him ser you and my other brothers ser boros turned to sansa how is it you are not in your chambers at this hour lady i went to the godswood to pray for the safety of the king the lie sounded better this time almost true you expect her to sleep with all the noise clegane said what was the trouble fools at the gate ser boros admitted some loose tongues spread tales of the preparations for tyreks wedding feast and these wretches got it in their heads they should be feasted too his grace led a sortie and sent them scurrying a brave boy clegane said mouth twitching let us see how brave he is when he faces my brother sansa thought the hound escorted her across the drawbridge as they were winding their way up the steps she said why do you let people call you a dog you wont let anyone call you a knight i like dogs better than knights my fathers father was kennelmaster at the rock one autumn year page lord tytos came between a lioness and her prey the lioness didnt give a shit that she was lannisters own sigil bitch tore into my lords horse and would have done for my lord too but my grandfather came up with the hounds three of his dogs died running her off my grandfather lost a leg so lannister paid him for it with lands and a towerhouse and took his son to squire the three dogs on our banner are the three that died in the yellow of autumn grass a hound will die for you but never lie to you and hell look you straight in the face he cupped her under the jaw raising her chin his fingers pinching her painfully and thats more than little birds can do isnt it i never got my song i i know a song about florian and jonquil florian and jonquil a fool and his cunt spare me but one day ill have a song from you whether you will it or no i will sing it for you gladly sandor clegane snorted pretty thing and such a bad liar a dog can smell a lie you know look around you and take a good whiff theyre all liars here and every one better than you chapter arya when she climbed all the way up to the highest branch arya could see chimneys poking through the trees thatched roofs clustered along the shore of the lake and the small stream that emptied into it and a wooden pier jutted out into the water beside a low long building with a slate roof she skinnied farther out until the branch began to sag under her weight no boats were tied to the pier but she could see thin tendrils of smoke rising from some of the chimneys and part of a wagon jutting out behind a stable someones there arya chewed her lip all the other places theyd come upon had been empty and desolate farms villages castles septs barns it made no matter if it could burn the lannisters had burned it if it could die theyd killed it they had even set the woods ablaze where they could though the leaves were still green and wet from recent rains and the fires had not spread they would have burned the lake if they could have gendry had said and arya knew he was right on the night of their escape the flames of the burning town had shimmered so brightly on the water that it had seemed that the lake was afire when they finally summoned the nerve to steal back into the ruins the next night nothing remained but blackened stones the hollow shells of houses and corpses in some places wisps of pale smoke still rose from the ashes hot pie had pleaded with them not to go back and lommy called them fools and swore that ser amory would catch them and kill them too but lorch and his men had long gone by the time they reached the holdfast they found the gates broken down the walls partly demolished and the inside strewn with the unburied dead one look was enough for gendry theyre killed every one he said and dogs have been at them too look page or wolves dogs wolves it makes no matter its done here but arya would not leave until they found yoren they couldnt have killed him she told herself he was too hard and tough and a brother of the nights watch besides she said as much to gendry as they searched among the corpses the axe blow that had killed him had split his skull apart but the great tangled beard could be no one elses or the garb patched and unwashed and so faded it was more grey than black ser amory lorch had given no more thought to burying his own dead than to those he had murdered and the corpses of four lannister menatarms were heaped near yorens arya wondered how many it had taken to bring him down he was going to take me home she thought as they dug the old mans hole there were too many dead to bury them all but yoren at least must have a grave arya had insisted he was going to bring me safe to winterfell he promised part of her wanted to cry the other part wanted to kick him it was gendry who thought of the lords towerhouse and the three that yoren had sent to hold it they had come under attack as well but the round tower had only one entry a secondstory door reached by a ladder once that had been pulled inside ser amorys men could not get at them the lannisters had piled brush around the towers base and set it afire but the stone would not burn and lorch did not have the patience to starve them out cutiack opened the door at gendrys shout and when kurz said theyd be better pressing on north than going back arya had clung to the hope that she still might reach winterfell well this village was no winterfell but those thatched roofs promised warmth and shelter and maybe even food if they were bold enough to risk them unless its lorch there he had horses he would have traveled faster than us she watched from the tree for a long time hoping she might see something a man a horse a banner anything that would help her know a few times she glimpsed motion but the buildings were so far off it was hard to be certain once very clearly she heard the whinny of a horse the air was full of birds crows mostly from afar they were no larger than flies as they wheeled and flapped above the thatched roofs to the east gods eye was a sheet of sunhammered blue that filled half the world some days as they made their slow way up the muddy shore gendry wanted no part of any roads and even hot pie and lommy saw the sense in that arya felt as though the lake were calling her she wanted to leap into those placid blue waters to feel clean again to swim and splash and bask in the sun but she dare not take off her clothes where the others could see not even to wash them at the end of the day she would often sit on a rock and dangle her feet in the cool water she had finally thrown away her cracked and rotted shoes walking barefoot was hard at first but the blisters had finally broken the cuts had healed and her soles had turned to leather the mud was nice between her toes and she liked to feel the earth underfoot when she walked from up here she could see a small wooded island off to the northeast thirty yards from shore three black swans were gliding over the water so serene no one had told them that war had come and they cared nothing for burning towns and butchered men she stared at them with yearning part of her page wanted to be a swan the other part wanted to eat one she had broken her fast on some acorn paste and a handful of bugs bugs werent so bad when you got used to them worms were worse but still not as bad as the pain in your belly after days without food finding bugs was easy all you had to do was kick over a rock arya had eaten a bug once when she was little just to make sansa screech so she hadnt been afraid to eat another weasel wasnt either but hot pie retched up the beetle he tried to swallow and lommy and gendry wouldnt even try yesterday gendry had caught a frog and shared it with lommy and a few days before hot pie had found blackberries and stripped the bush bare but mostly they had been living on water and acorns kurz had told them how to use rocks and make a kind of acorn paste it tasted awful she wished the poacher hadnt died hed known more about the woods than all the rest of them together but hed taken an arrow through the shoulder pulling in the ladder at the towerhouse tarber had packed it with mud and moss from the lake and for a day or two kurz swore the wound was nothing even though the flesh of his throat was turning dark while angry red welts crept up his jaw and down his chest then one morning he couldnt find the strength to get up and by the next he was dead they buried him under a mound of stones and cutjack had claimed his sword and hunting horn while tarber helped himself to bow and boots and knife theyd taken it all when they left at first they thought the two had just gone hunting that theyd soon return with game and feed them all but they waited and waited until finally gendry made them move on maybe tarber and cutjack figured they would stand a better chance without a gaggle of orphan boys to herd along they probably would too but that didnt stop her hating them for leaving beneath her tree hot pie barked like a dog kurz had told them to use animal sounds to signal to each other an old poachers trick hed said but hed died before he could teach them how to make the sounds right hot pies bird calls were awful his dog was better but not much arya hopped from the high branch to one beneath it her hands out for balance a water dancer never falls lightfoot her toes curled tight around the branch she walked a few feet hopped down to a larger limb then swung hand over hand through the tangle of leaves until she reached the trunk the bark was rough beneath her fingers against her toes she descended quickly jumping down the final six feet rolling when she landed gendry gave her a hand to pull her up you were up there a long time what could you see a fishing village just a little place north along the shore twentysix thatch roofs and one slate i counted i saw part of a wagon someones there at the sound of her voice weasel came creeping out from the bushes lommy had named her that he said she looked like a weasel which wasnt true but they couldnt keep on calling her the crying girl after she finally stopped crying her mouth was filthy arya hoped she hadnt been eating mud again did you see people asked gendry mostly just roofs arya admitted but some chimneys were smoking and i heard a horse the weasel put her arms around her leg clutching tight sometimes she did that now if theres people theres food hot pie said too loudly gendry was always telling him to be more quiet but it never did any good might be theyd give us some page might be theyd kill us too gendry said not if we yielded hot pie said hopefully now you sound like lommy lommy greenhands sat propped up between two thick roots at the foot of an oak a spear had taken him through his left calf during the fight at the holdfast by the end of the next day he had to limp along onelegged with an arm around gendry and now he couldnt even do that theyd hacked branches off trees to make a litter for him but it was slow hard work carrying him along and he whimpered every time they jounced him we have to yield he said thats what yoren should have done he should have opened the gates like they said arya was sick of lommy going on about how yoren should have yielded it was all he talked about when they carried him that and his leg and his empty belly hot pie agreed they told yoren to open the gates they told him in the kings name you have to do what they tell you in the kings name it was that stinky old mans fault if hed of yielded they would have left us be gendry frowned knights and lordlings they take each other captive and pay ransoms but they dont care if the likes of you yield or not he turned to arya what else did you see if its a fishing village theyd sell us fish i bet said hot pie the lake teemed with fresh fish but they had nothing to catch them with arya had tried to use her hands the way shed seen koss do but fish were quicker than pigeons and the water played tricks on her eyes i dont know about fish arya tugged at the weasels matted hair thinking it might be best to hack it off theres crows down by the water somethings dead there fish washed up on shore hot pie said if the crows eat it i bet we could we should catch some crows we could eat them said lommy we could make a fire and roast them like chickens gendry looked fierce when he scowled his beard had grown in thick and black as briar i said no fires lommys hungry hot pie whined and i am too were all hungry said arya youre not lommy spat from the ground worm breath arya could have kicked him in his wound i said id dig worms for you too if you wanted lommy made a disgusted face if it wasnt for my leg id hunt us some boars some boars she mocked you need a boarspear to hunt boars and horses and dogs and men to page flush the boar from its lair her father had hunted boar in the wolfswood with robb and jon once he even took bran but never arya even though she was older septa mordane said boar hunting was not for ladies and mother only promised that when she was older she might have her own hawk she was older now but if she had a hawk shed eat it what do you know about hunting boars said hot pie more than you gendry was in no mood to hear it quiet both of you i need to think what to do he always looked pained when he tried to think like it hurt him something fierce yield lommy said i told you to shut up about the yielding we dont even know whos in there maybe we can steal some food lommy could steal if it wasnt for his leg said hot pie he was a thief in the city a bad thief arya said or he wouldnt have got caught gendry squinted up at the sun evenfall will be the best time to sneak in ill go scout come dark no ill go arya said youre too noisy gendry got that look on his face well both go arry should go said lommy hes sneakier than you are well both go i said but what if you dont come back hot pie cant carry me by himself you know he cant and theres wolves hot pie said i heard them last night when i had the watch they sounded close arya had heard them too shed been asleep in the branches of an elm but the howling had woken her shed sat awake for a good hour listening to them prickles creeping up her spine and you wont even let us have a fire to keep them off hot pie said its not right leaving us for the wolves no one is leaving you gendry said in disgust lommy has his spear if the wolves come and youll be with him were just going to go see thats all were coming back whoever it is you should yield to them lommy whined i need some potion for my leg it hurts bad if we see any leg potion well bring it gendry said arry lets go i want to get near before the sun is down hot pie you keep weasel here i dont want her following last time she kicked me page ill kick you if you dont keep her here without waiting for an answer gendry donned his steel helm and walked off arya had to scamper to keep up gendry was five years older and a foot taller than she was and long of leg as well for a while he said nothing just plowed on through the trees with an angry look on his face making too much noise but finally he stopped and said i think lommys going to die she was not surprised kurz had died of his wound and hed been a lot stronger than lommy whenever it was aryas turn to help carry him she could feel how warm his skin was and smell the stink off his leg maybe we could find a maester you only find maesters in castles and even if we found one he wouldnt dirty his hands on the likes of lommy gendry ducked under a lowhanging limb thats not true maester luwin would have helped anyone who came to him she was certain hes going to die and the sooner he does it the better for the rest of us we should just leave him like he says if it was you or me hurt you know hed leave us they scrambled down a steep cut and up the other side using roots for handholds im sick of carrying him and im sick of all his talk about yielding too if he could stand up id knock his teeth in lommys no use to anyone that crying girls no use either you leave weasel alone shes just scared and hungry is all arya glanced back but the girl was not following for once hot pie must have grabbed her like gendry had told him shes no use gendry repeated stubbornly her and hot pie and lommy theyre slowing us down and theyre going to get us killed youre the only one of the bunch whos good for anything even if you are a girl arya froze in her steps im not a girl yes you are do you think im as stupid as they are no youre stupider the nights watch doesnt take girls everyone knows that thats true i dont know why yoren brought you but he must have had some reason youre still a girl i am not then pull out your cock and take a piss go on i dont need to take a piss if i wanted to i could liar you cant take out your cock because you dont have one i never noticed before when there were thirty of us but you always go off in the woods to make your water you dont see hot pie doing that nor me neither if youre not a girl you must be some eunuch youre the eunuch page you know im not gendry smiled you want me to take out my cock and prove it i dont have anything to hide yes you do arya blurted desperate to escape the subject of the cock she didnt have those gold cloaks were after you at the inn and you wont tell us why i wish i knew i think yoren knew but he never told me why did you think they were after you though arya bit her lip she remembered what yoren had said the day he had hacked off her hair this lot half o them would turn you over to the queen quick as spit for a pardon and maybe a few silvers the other halfd do the same only theyd rape you first only gendry was different the queen wanted him too ill tell you if youll tell me she said warily i would if i knew arry is that really what youre called or do you have some girls name arya glared at the gnarled root by her feet she realized that the pretense was done gendry knew and she had nothing in her pants to convince him otherwise she could draw needle and kill him where he stood or else trust him she wasnt certain shed be able to kill him even if she tried he had his own sword and he was a lot stronger all that was left was the truth lommy and hot pie cant know she said they wont he swore not from me arya she raised her eyes to his my name is arya of house stark of house it took him a moment before he said the kings hand was named stark the one they killed for a traitor he was never a traitor he was my father gendrys eyes widened so thats why you thought she nodded yoren was taking me home to winterfell i youre highborn then a youll be a lady arya looked down at her ragged clothes and bare feet all cracked and callused she saw the dirt under her nails the scabs on her elbows the scratches on her hands septa mordane wouldnt even know me i bet sansa might but shed pretend not to my mothers a lady and my sister but i never was yes you were you were a lords daughter and you lived in a castle didnt you and you gods be good i never all of a sudden gendry seemed uncertain almost afraid all that about cocks i never should have said that and i been pissing in front of you and everything i i beg your pardon mlady stop that arya hissed was he mocking her i know my courtesies mlady gendry said stubborn as ever whenever highborn girls came into the shop with their fathers my mastcr told me i was to bend the knee and speak only when they spoke to page me and call them mlady if you start calling me mlady even hot pie is going to notice and you better keep on pissing the same way too as mlady commands arya slammed his chest with both hands he tripped over a stone and sat down with a thump what kind of lords daughter are you he said laughing this kind she kicked him in the side but it only made him laugh harder you laugh all you like im going to see whos in the village the sun had already fallen below the trees dusk would be on them in no time at all for once it was gendry who had to hurry after you smell that she asked he sniffed the air rotten fish you know its not we better be careful ill go around west see if theres some road there must be if you saw a wagon you take the shore if you need help bark like a dog thats stupid if i need help ill shout help she darted away bare feet silent in the grass when she glanced back over her shoulder he was watching her with that pained look on his face that meant he was thinking hes probably thinking that he shouldnt be letting mlady go stealing food arya just knew he was going to be stupid now the smell grew stronger as she got closer to the village it did not smell like rotten fish to her this stench was ranker fouler she wrinkled her nose where the trees began to thin she used the undergrowth slipping from bush to bush quiet as a shadow every few yards she stopped to listen the third time she heard horses and a mans voice as well and the smell got worse dead mans stink thats what it is she had smelled it before with yoren and the others a dense thicket of brambles grew south of the village by the time she reached it the long shadows of sunset had begun to fade and the lantern bugs were coming out she could see thatched roofs just beyond the hedge she crept along until she found a gap and squirmed through on her belly keeping well hidden until she saw what made the smell beside the gently lapping waters of gods eye a long gibbet of raw green wood had been thrown up and things that had once been men dangled there their feet in chains while crows pecked at their flesh and flapped from corpse to corpse for every crow there were a hundred flies when the wind blew off the lake the nearest corpse twisted on its chain ever so slightly the crows had eaten most of its face and something else had been at it as well something much larger throat and chest had been torn apart and glistening green entrails and ribbons of ragged flesh dangled from where the belly had been opened one arm had been ripped right off the shoulder arya saw the bones a few feet away gnawed and cracked picked clean of meat she made herself look at the next man and the one beyond him and the one beyond him telling herself page she was hard as a stone corpses all so savaged and decayed that it took her a moment to realize they had been stripped before they were hanged they did not look like naked people they hardly looked like people at all the crows had eaten their eyes and sometimes their faces of the sixth in the long row nothing remained but a single leg still tangled in its chains swaying with each breeze fear cuts deeper than swords dead men could not hurt her but whoever had killed them could well beyond the gibbet two men in mail hauberks stood leaning on their spears in front of the long low building by the water the one with the slate roof a pair of tall poles had been driven into the muddy ground in front of it banners drooping from each staff one looked red and one paler white or yellow maybe but both were limp and with the dusk settling she could not even be certain that red one was lannister crimson i dont need to see the lion i can see all the dead people who else would it be but lannisters then there was a shout the two spearmen turned at the cry and a third man came into view shoving a captive before him it was growing too dark to make out faces but the prisoner was wearing a shiny steel helm and when arya saw the horns she knew it was gendry you stupid stupid stupid stupid she thought if hed been here she would have kicked him again the guards were talking loudly but she was too far away to make out the words especially with the crows gabbling and flapping closer to hand one of the spearmen snatched the helm off gendrys head and asked him a question but he must not have liked the answer because he smashed him across the face with the butt of his spear and knocked him down the one whod captured him gave him a kick while the second spearman was trying on the bullshead helm finally they pulled him to his feet and marched him off toward the storehouse when they opened the heavy wooden doors a small boy darted out but one of the guards grabbed his arm and flung him back inside arya heard sobbing from inside the building and then a shriek so loud and full of pain that it made her bite her lip the guards shoved gendry inside with the boy and barred the doors behind them just then a breath of wind came sighing off the lake and the banners stirred and lifted the one on the tall staff bore the golden lion as shed feared on the other three sleek black shapes ran across a field as yellow as butter dogs she thought arya had seen those dogs before but where it didnt matter the only thing that mattered was that they had gendry even if he was stubborn and stupid she had to get him out she wondered if they knew that the queen wanted him one of the guards took off his helm and donned gendrys instead it made her angry to see him wearing it but she knew there was nothing she could do to stop him she thought she heard more screams from inside the windowless storehouse muffled by the masonry but it was hard to be certain she stayed long enough to see the guard changed and much more besides men came and went they led their horses down to the stream to drink a hunting party returned from the wood carrying a deers carcass slung from a pole she watched them clean and gut it and build a cookfire on the far side of the stream and the smell of cooking meat mingled queerly with the stench of corruption her empty belly roiled and she thought she might retch the prospect of food brought other men out of the houses near all of them wearing bits of mail or boiled leather when the deer was cooked the choicest portions were carried to one of the houses page she thought that the dark might let her crawl close and free gendry but the guards kindled torches off the cookfire a squire brought meat and bread to the two guarding the storehouse and later two more men joined them and they all passed a skin of wine from hand to hand when it was empty the others left but the two guards remained leaning on their spears aryas arms and legs were stiff when she finally wriggled out from under the briar into the dark of the wood it was a black night with a thin sliver of moon appearing and disappearing as the clouds blew past silent as a shadow she told herself as she moved through the trees in this darkness she dared not run for fear of tripping on some unseen root or losing her way on her left gods eye lapped calmly against its shores on her right a wind sighed through the branches and leaves rustled and stirred far off she heard the howling of wolves lommy and hot pie almost shit themselves when she stepped out of the trees behind them quiet she told them putting an arm around weasel when the little girl came running up hot pie stared at her with big eyes we thought you left us he had his shortsword in hand the one yoren had taken off the gold cloak i was scared you was a wolf wheres the bull asked lommy they caught him arya whispered we have to get him out hot pie you got to help well sneak up and kill the guards and then ill open the door hot pie and lommy exchanged a look how many i couldnt count arya admitted twenty at least but only two on the door hot pie looked as if he were going to cry we cant fight twenty you only need to fight one ill do the other and well get gendry out and run we should yield lommy said just go in and yield arya shook her head stubbornly then just leave him arry lommy pleaded they dont know about the rest of us if we hide theyll go away you know they will its not our fault gendrys captured youre stupid lommy arya said angrily youll die if we dont get gendry out whos going to carry you you and hot pie all the time with no one else to help well never do it gendry was the strong one anyhow i dont care what you say im going back for him she looked at hot pie are you coming hot pie glanced at lommy at arya at lommy again ill come he said reluctantly lommy you keep weasel here page he grabbed the little girl by the hand and pulled her close what if the wolves come yield arya suggested finding their way back to the village seemed to take hours hot pie kept stumbling in the dark and losing his way and arya had to wait for him and double back finally she took him by the hand and led him along through the trees just be quiet and follow when they could make out the first faint glow of the village fires against the sky she said theres dead men hanging on the other side of the hedge but theyre nothing to be scared of just remember fear cuts deeper than swords we have to go real quiet and slow hot pie nodded she wriggled under the briar first and waited for him on the far side crouched low hot pie emerged pale and panting face and arms bloody with long scratches he started to say something but arya put a finger to his lips on hands and knees they crawled along the gibbet beneath the swaying dead hot pie never once looked up nor made a sound until the crow landed on his back and he gave a muffled gasp whos there a voice boomed suddenly from the dark hot pie leapt to his feet i yield he threw away his sword as dozens of crows rose shrieking and complaining to flap about the corpses arya grabbed his leg and tried to drag him back down but he wrenched loose and ran forward waving his arms i yield i yield she bounced up and drew needle but by then men were all around her arya slashed at the nearest but he blocked her with a steelclad arm and someone else slammed into her and dragged her to the ground and a third man wrenched the sword from her grasp when she tried to bite her teeth snapped shut on cold dirty chainmail oho a fierce one the man said laughing the blow from his ironclad fist near knocked her head off they talked over her as she lay hurting but arya could not seem to understand the words her ears rang when she tried to crawl off the earth moved beneath her they took needle the shame of that hurt worse than the pain and the pain hurt a lot jon had given her that sword syrio had taught her to use it finally someone grabbed the front of her jerkin yanked her to her knees hot pie was kneeling too before the tallest man arya had ever seen a monster from one of old nans stories she never saw where the giant had come from three black dogs raced across his faded yellow surcoat and his face looked as hard as if it had been cut from stone suddenly arya knew where she had seen those dogs before the night of the tourney at kings landing all the knights had hung their shields outside their pavilions that one belongs to the hounds brother sansa had confided when they passed the black dogs on the yellow field hes even bigger than hodor youll see they call him the mountain that rides arya let her head droop only half aware of what was going on around her hot pie was yielding some more the mountain said youll lead us to these others and walked off next she was stumbling past the dead men on their gibbet while hot pie told their captors hed bake them pies and tarts if they didnt hurt him four men went with them one carried a torch one a longsword two had spears they found lommy where theyd left him under the oak i yield he called out at once when he saw them hed flung away his own spear and raised his hands splotchy green with old dye i yield please page the man with the torch searched around under the trees are you the last baker boy said there was a girl she ran off when she heard you coming lommy said you made a lot of noise and arya thought run weasel run as far as you can run and hide and never come back tell us where we can find that whoreson dondarrion and therell be a hot meal in it for you who said lommy blankly i told you this lot dont know no more than those cunts in the village waste obloody time one of the spearmen drifted over to lommy something wrong with your leg boy it got hurt can you walk he sounded concerned no said lommy you got to carry me think so the man lifted his spear casually and drove the point through the boys soft throat lommy never even had time to yield again he jerked once and that was all when the man pulled his spear loose blood sprayed out in a dark fountain carry him he says he muttered chuckling chapter tyrion they had warned him to dress warmly tyrion lannister took them at their word he was garbed in heavy quilted breeches and a woolen doublet and over it all he had thrown the shadowskin cloak he had acquired in the mountains of the moon the cloak was absurdly long made for a man twice his height when he was not ahorse the only way to wear the thing was to wrap it around him several times which made him look like a ball of striped fur even so he was glad he had listened the chill in the long dank vault went bone deep timett had chosen to retreat back up to the cellar after a brief taste of the cold below they were somewhere under the hill of rhaenys behind the guildhall of the alchemists the damp stone walls were splotchy with nitre and the only light came from the sealed ironandglass oil lamp that hallyne the pyromancer carried so gingerly gingerly indeed and these would be the ginger jars tyrion lifted one for inspection it was round and ruddy a fat clay grapefruit a little big for his hand but it would fit comfortably in the grip of a normal man he knew the pottery was thin so fragile that even he had been warned not to squeeze too tightly lest he crush it in his fist the clay felt roughened pebbled hallyne told him that was intentional a smooth pot is more apt to slip from a mans grasp page the wildfire oozed slowly toward the lip of the jar when tyrion tilted it to peer inside the color would be a murky green he knew but the poor light made that impossible to confirm thick he observed that is from the cold my lord said hallyne a pallid man with soft damp hands and an obsequious manner he was dressed in striped blackandscarlet robes trimmed with sable but the fur looked more than a little patchy and motheaten as it warms the substance will flow more easily like lamp oil the substance was the pyromancers own term for wildfire they called each other wisdom as well which tyrion found almost as annoying as their custom of hinting at the vast secret stores of knowledge that they wanted him to think they possessed once theirs had been a powerful guild but in recent centuries the maesters of the citadel had supplanted the alchemists almost everywhere now only a few of the older order remained and they no longer even pretended to transmute metals but they could make wildfire water will not quench it i am told that is so once it takes fire the substance will burn fiercely until it is no more more it will seep into cloth wood leather even steel so they take fire as well tyrion remembered the red priest thoros of myr and his flaming sword even a thin coating of wildfire could burn for an hour thoros always needed a new sword after a melee but robert had been fond of the man and ever glad to provide one why doesnt it seep into the clay as well oh but it does said hallyne there is a vault below this one where we store the older pots those from king aeryss day it was his fancy to have the jars made in the shapes of fruits very perilous fruits indeed my lord hand and hmmm riper now than ever if you take my meaning we have sealed them with wax and pumped the lower vault full of water but even so by rights they ought to have been destroyed but so many of our masters were murdered during the sack of kings landing the few acolytes who remained were unequal to the task and much of the stock we made for aerys was lost only last year two hundred jars were discovered in a storeroom beneath the great sept of baelor no one could recall how they came there but im sure i do not need to tell you that the high septon was beside himself with terror i myself saw that they were safely moved i had a cart filled with sand and sent our most able acolytes we worked only by night we did a splendid job i have no doubt tyrion placed the jar hed been holding back among its fellows they covered the table standing in orderly rows of four and marching away into the subterranean dimness and there were other tables beyond many other tables these ah fruits of the late king aerys can they still be used oh yes most certainly but carefully my lord ever so carefully as it ages the substance grows ever more hmmmm fickle let us say any flame will set it afire any spark too much heat and jars will blaze up of their own accord it is not wise to let them sit in sunlight even for a short time once the fire begins within the heat causes the substance to expand violently and the jars shortly fly to pieces if other jars should happen to be stored in the same vicinity those go up as well and so how many jars do you have at present this morning the wisdom munciter told me that we had seven thousand eight hundred and forty that count includes four thousand jars from king aeryss day to be sure page our overripe fruits hallyne bobbed his head wisdom malliard believes we shall be able to provide a full ten thousand jars as was promised the queen i concur the pyromancer looked indecently pleased with that prospect assuming our enemies give you the time the pyromancers kept their recipe for wildfire a closely guarded secret but tyrion knew that it was a lengthy dangerous and timeconsuming process he had assumed the promise of ten thousand jars was a wild boast like that of the bannerman who vows to marshal ten thousand swords for his lord and shows up on the day of battle with a hundred and two ff they can truly give us ten thousand he did not know whether he ought to be delighted or terrified perhaps a smidge of both i trust that your guild brothers are not engaging in any unseemly haste wisdom we do not want ten thousand jars of defective wildfire nor even one and we most certainly do not want any mishaps there will be no mishaps my lord hand the substance is prepared by trained acolytes in a series of bare stone cells and each jar is removed by an apprentice and carried down here the instant it is ready above each work cell is a room filled entirely with sand a protective spell has been laid on the floors hmmm most powerful any fire in the cell below causes the floors to fall away and the sand smothers the blaze at once not to mention the careless acolyte by spell tyrion imagined hallyne meant clever trick he thought he would like to inspect one of these falseceilinged cells to see how it worked but this was not the time perhaps when the war was won my brethren are never careless hallyne insisted if i may be hmmmm frank oh do the substance flows through my veins and lives in the heart of every pyromancer we respect its power but the common soldier hmmmm the crew of one of the queens spitfires say in the unthinking frenzy of battle any little mistake can bring catastrophe that cannot be said too often my father often told king aerys as much as his father told old king jaehaerys they must have listened tyrion said if they had burned the city down someone would have told me so your counsel is that we had best be careful be very careful said hallyne be very very careful these clay jars do you have an ample supply we do my lord and thank you for asking you wont mind if i take some then a few thousand a few thousand or however many your guild can spare without interfering with production its empty pots im asking for understand have them sent round to the captains on each of the city gates page i will my lord but why tyrion smiled up at him when you tell me to dress warmly i dress warmly when you tell me to be careful well he gave a shrug ive seen enough perhaps you would be so good as to escort me back up to my litter it would be my great hmmm pleasure my lord hallyne lifted the lamp and led the way back to the stairs it was good of you to visit us a great honor hmmm it has been too long since the kings hand graced us with his presence not since lord rossart and he was of our order that was back in king aeryss day king aerys took a great interest in our work king aerys used you to roast the flesh off his enemies his brother jaime had told him a few stories of the mad king and his pet pyromancers joffrey will be interested as well i have no doubt which is why id best keep him well away from you it is our great hope to have the king visit our guildhall in his own royal person i have spoken of it to your royal sister a great feast it was growing warmer as they climbed his grace has prohibited all feasting until such time as the war is won at my insistence the king does not think it fitting to banquet on choice food while his people go without bread a most hmmm loving gesture my lord perhaps instead some few of us might call upon the king at the red keep a small demonstration of our powers as it were to distract his grace from his many cares for an evening wildfire is but one of the dread secrets of our ancient order many and wondrous are the things we might show you i will take it up with my sister tyrion had no objection to a few magic tricks but joffs fondness for making men fight to the death was trial enough he had no intention of allowing the boy to taste the possibilities of burning them alive when at last they reached the top of the steps tyrion shrugged out of his shadowskin fur and folded it over his arm the guildhall of the alchemists was an imposing warren of black stone but hallyne led him through the twists and turns until they reached the gallery of the iron torches a long echoing chamber where columns of green fire danced around black metal columns twenty feet tall ghostly flames shimmered off the polished black marble of the walls and floor and bathed the hall in an emerald radiance tyrion would have been more impressed if he hadnt known that the great iron torches had only been lit this morning in honor of his visit and would be extinguished the instant the doors closed behind him wildfire was too costly to squander they emerged atop the broad curving steps that fronted on the street of the sisters near the foot of visenyas hill he bid hallyne farewell and waddled down to where timett son of timett waited with an escort of burned men given his purpose today it had seemed a singularly appropriate choice for his guard besides their scars struck terror in the hearts of the city rabble that was all to the good these days only three nights past another mob had gathered at the gates of the red keep chanting for food joff had unleashed a storm of arrows against them slaying four and then shouted down that they had his leave to eat their dead winning us still more friends tyrion was surprised to see brorm standing beside the litter as well what are you doing here page delivering your messages bronn said ironhand wants you urgently at the gate of the gods he wont say why and youve been summoned to maegors too summoned tyrion knew of only one person who would presume to use that word and what does cersei want of me brorm shrugged the queen commands you to return to the castle at once and attend her in her chambers that stripling cousin of yours delivered the message four hairs on his lip and he thinks hes a man four hairs and a knighthood hes ser lancel now never forget tyrion knew that ser jacelyn would not send for him unless the matter was of import id best see what bywater wants inform my sister that i will attend her on my return she wont like that brorm warned good the longer cersei waits the angrier shell become and anger makes her stupid i much prefer angry and stupid to composed and cunning tyrion tossed his folded cloak into his litter and timett helped him up after it the market square inside the gate of the gods which in normal times would have been thronged with farmers selling vegetables was near deserted when tyrion crossed it ser jacelyn met him at the gate and raised his iron hand in brusque salute my lord your cousin cleos frey is here come from riverrun under a peace banner with a letter from robb stark peace terms so he says sweet cousin show me to him the gold cloaks had confined ser cleos to a windowless guardroom in the gatehouse he rose when they entered tyrion you are a most welcome sight thats not something i hear often cousin has cersei come with you my sister is otherwise occupied is this starks letter he plucked it off the table ser jacelyn you may leave us bywater bowed and departed i was asked to bring the offer to the queen regent ser cleos said as the door shut i shall tyrion glanced over the map that robb stark had sent with his letter all in good time cousin sit rest you look gaunt and haggard he looked worse than that in truth yes ser cleos lowered himself onto a bench it is bad in the riverlands tyrion around the gods eye and along the kingsroad especially the river lords are burning their own crops to try and starve us and your fathers foragers are torching every village they take and putting the smallfolk to the sword page that was the way of war the smallfolk were slaughtered while the highborn were held for ransom remind me to thank the gods that i was bom a lannister ser cleos ran a hand through his thin brown hair even with a peace banner we were attacked twice wolves in mail hungry to savage anyone weaker than themselves the gods alone know what side they started on but theyre on their own side now lost three men and twice as many wounded what news of our foe tyrion turned his attention back to starks terms the boy does not want too much only half the realm the release of our captives hostages his fathers sword oh yes and his sis ters the boy sits idle at riverrun ser cleos said i think he fears to face your father in the field his strength grows less each day the river lords have departed each to defend his own lands is this what father intended tyrion rolled up starks map these terms will never do will you at least consent to trade the stark girls for tion and willem ser cleos asked plaintively tion frey was his younger brother tyrion recalled no he said gently but well propose our own exchange of captives let me consult with cersei and the council we shall send you back to riverrun with our terms clearly the prospect did not cheer him my lord i do not believe robb stark will yield easily it is lady catelyn who wants this peace not the boy lady catelyn wants her daughters tyrion pushed himself down from the bench letter and map in hand ser jacelyn will see that you have food and fire you look in dire need of sleep cousin i will send for you when we know more he found ser jacelyn on the ramparts watching several hundred new recruits drilling in the field below with so many seeking refuge in kings landing there was no lack of men willing to join the city watch for a full belly and a bed of stiaw in the barracks but tyrion had no illusions about how well these ragged defenders of theirs would fight if it came to battle you did well to send for me tyrion said i shall leave ser cleos in your hands he is to have every hospitality and his escort the commander wanted to know give them food and clean garb and find a maester to see to their hurts they are not to set foot inside the city is that understood it would never do to have the truth of conditions in kings landing reach robb stark in riverrun well understood my lord oh and one more thing the alchemists will be sending a large supply of clay pots to each of the city gates youre to use them to train the men who will work your spitfires fill the pots with green paint and have them drill at loading and firing any man who spatters should be replaced when they have mastered the paint pots substitute lamp oil and have them work at lighting the jars and firing them while aflame once they learn to do that without burning themselves they may be ready for wildfire page ser jacelyn scratched at his cheek with his iron hand wise measures though i have no love for that alchemists piss nor i but i use what im given once back inside his litter tyrion lannister drew the curtains and plumped a cushion under his elbow cersei would be displeased to learn that he had intercepted starks letter but his father had sent him here to rule not to please cersei it seemed to him that robb stark had given them a golden chance let the boy wait at riverrun dreaming of an easy peace tyrion would reply with terms of his own giving the king in the north just enough of what he wanted to keep him hopeful let ser cleos wear out his bony frey rump riding to and fro with offers and counters all the while their cousin ser stafford would be training and arming the new host hed raised at casterly rock once he was ready he and lord tywin could smash the tullys and starks between them now if only roberts brothers would be so accommodating glacial as his progress was still renly baratheon crept north and east with his huge southron host and scarcely a night passed that tyrion did not dread being awakened with the news that lord stannis was sailing his fleet up the blackwater rush well it would seem i have a goodly stock of wildfire but still the sound of some hubbub in the street intruded on his worries tyrion peered out cautiously between the curtains they were passing through cobblers square where a sizable crowd had gathered beneath the leather awnings to listen to the rantings of a prophet a robe of undyed wool belted with a hempen rope marked him for one of the begging brothers corruption the man cried shrilly there is the warning behold the fathers scourge he pointed at the fuzzy red wound in the sky from this vantage the distant castle on aegons high hill was directly behind him with the comet hanging forebodingly over its towers a clever choice of stage tyrion reflected we have become swollen bloated foul brother couples with sister in the bed of kings and the fruit of their incest capers in his palace to the piping of a twisted little monkey demon highborn ladies fornicate with fools and give birth to monsters even the high septon has forgotten the gods he bathes in scented waters and grows fat on lark and lamprey while his people starve pride comes before prayer maggots rule our castles and gold is all but no more the rotten summer is at an end and the whoremonger king is brought low when the boar did open him a great stench rose to heaven and a thousand snakes slid forth from his belly hissing and biting he jabbed his bony finger back at comet and castle there comes the harbinger cleanse yourselves the gods cry out lest ye be cleansed bathe in the wine of righteousness or you shall be bathed in fire fire fire other voices echoed but the hoots of derision almost drowned them out tyrion took solace from that he gave the command to continue and the litter rocked like a ship on a rough sea as the burned men cleared a path twisted little monkey demon indeed the wretch did have a point about the high septon to be sure what was it that moon boy had said of him the other day a pious man who worships the seven so fervently that he eats a meal for each of them whenever he sits to table the memory of the fools jape made tyrion smile he was pleased to reach the red keep without further incident as he climbed the steps to his chambers tyrion felt a deal more hopeful than he had at dawn time thats all i truly need time to piece it all together once the chain is done he opened the door to his solar page cersei turned away from the window her skirts swirling around her slender hips how dare you ignore my summons who admitted you to my tower your tower this is my sons royal castle so they tell me tyrion was not amused crawn would be even less so his moon brothers had the guard today i was about to come to you as it happens were you he swung the door shut behind him you doubt me always and with good reason im hurt tyrion waddled to the sideboard for a cup of wine he knew no surer way to work up a thirst than talking with cersei if ive given you offense i would know how what a disgusting little worm you are myrcella is my only daughter did you truly imagine that i would allow you to sell her like a bag of oats myrcella he thought well that egg has hatched lets see what color the chick is hardly a bag of oats myrcella is a princess some would say this is what she was born for or did you plan to marry her to tommen her hand lashed out knocking the wine cup from his hand to spill on the floor brother or no i should have your tongue out for that i am joffreys regent not you and i say that myrcella will not be shipped off to this dornishman the way i was shipped to robert baratheon tyrion shook wine off his fingers and sighed why not shed be a deal safer in dorne than she is here are you utterly ignorant or simply perverse you know as well as i that the martells have no cause to love us the martells have every cause to hate us nonetheless i expect them to agree prince dorans grievance against house lannister goes back only a generation but the dornishmen have warred against storms end and highgarden for a thousand years and renly has taken dornes allegiance for granted myrcella is nine trystane martell eleven i have proposed they wed when she reaches her fourteenth year until such time she would be an honored guest at sunspear under prince dorans protection a hostage cersei said mouth tightening an honored guest tyrion insisted and i suspect martell will treat myrcella more kindly than joffrey has treated sansa stark i had in mind to send ser arys oakheart with her with a knight of the kingsguard as her sworn shield no one is like to forget who or what she is small good ser arys will do her if doran martell decides that my daughters death would wash out his sisters page martell is too honorable to murder a nineyearold girl particularly one as sweet and innocent as myrcella so long as he holds her he can be reasonably certain that well keep faith on our side and the terms are too rich to refuse myrcella is the least part of it ive also offered him his sisters killer a council seat some castles on the marches too much cersei paced away from him restless as a lioness skirts swirling youve offered too much and without my authority or consent this is the prince of dorne we are speaking of if id offered less hed likely spit in my face too much cersei insisted whirling back what would you have offered him that hole between your legs tyrion said his own anger flaring this time he saw the slap coming his head snapped around with a crack sweet sweet sister he said i promise you that was the last time you will ever strike me his sister laughed dont threaten me little man do you think fathers letter keeps you safe a piece of paper eddard stark had a piece of paper too for all the good it did him eddard stark did not have the city watch tyrion thought nor my clansmen nor the sellswords that bronn has hired i do or so he hoped trusting in varys in ser jacelyn bywater in bronn lord stark had probably had his delusions as well yet he said nothing a wise man did not pour wildfire on a brazier instead he poured a fresh cup of wine how safe do you think myrcella will be if kings landing falls renly and stannis will mount her head beside yours and cersei began to cry tyrion lannister could not have been more astonished if aegon the conqueror himself had burst into the room riding on a dragon and juggling lemon pies he had not seen his sister weep since they were children together at casterly rock awkwardly he took a step toward her when your sister cries you were supposed to comfort her but this was cersei he reached a tentative hand for her shoulder dont touch me she said wrenching away it should not have hurt yet it did more than any slap redfaced as angry as she was griefstricken cersei struggled for breath dont look at me not not like this not you politely tyrion turned his back i did not mean to frighten you i promise you nothing will happen to myrcella liar she said behind him im not a child to be soothed with empty promises you told me you would free jaime too well where is he in riverrun i should imagine safe and under guard until i find a way to free him cersei sniffed i should have been born a man i would have no need of any of you then none of this would have been allowed to happen how could jaime let himself be captured by that boy and father i trusted in him fool that i am but where is he now that hes wanted what is he doing page making war from behind the walls of harrenhal she said scornfully a curious way of fighting it looks suspiciously like hiding look again what else would you call it father sits in one castle and robb stark sits in another and no one does anything there is sitting and there is sitting tyrion suggested each one waits for the other to move but the lion is still poised his tail twitching while the fawn is frozen by fear bowels turned to jelly no matter which way he bounds the lion will have him and he knows it and youre quite certain that father is the lion tyrion grinned its on all our banners she ignored the jest if it was father whod been taken captive jaime would not be sitting by idly i promise you faime would be battering his host to bloody bits against the walls of riverrun and the others take their chances he never did have any patience no more than you sweet sister not all of us can be as bold as jaime but there are other ways to win wars harrenhal is strong and well situated and kings landing is not as we both know perfectly well while father plays lion and fawn with the stark boy renly marches up the roseroad he could be at our gates any day now the city will not fall in a day from harrenhal it is a straight swift march down the kingsroad renly will scarce have unlimbered his siege engines before father takes him in the rear his host will be the hammer the city walls the anvil it makes a lovely picture cerseis green eyes bored into him wary yet hungry for the reassurance he was feeding her and if robb stark marches harrenhal is close enough to the fords of the trident so that roose bolton cannot bring the northern foot across to join with the young wolfs horse stark cannot march on kings landing without taking harrenhal first and even with bolton he is not strong enough to do that tyrion tried his most winning smile meanwhile father lives off the fat of the riverlands while our uncle stafford gathers fresh levies at the rock cersei regarded him suspiciously how could you know all this did father tell you his intentions when he sent you here no i glanced at a map her look turned to disdain youve conjured up every word of this in that grotesque head of yours havent you imp page tyrion tsked sweet sister i ask you if we werent winning would the starks have sued for peace he drew out the letter that ser cleos frey had brought the young wolf has sent us terms you see unacceptable terms to be sure but still a beginning would you care to see them yes that fast she was all queen again how do you come to have them they should have come to me what else is a hand for if not to hand you things tyrion handed her the letter his cheek still throbbed where cerseis hand had left its mark let her flay half my face it will be a small price to pay for her consent to the dornish marriage he would have that now he could sense it and certain knowledge of an informer too well that was the plum in his pudding chapter bran dancer was draped in bardings of snowy white wool emblazoned with the grey direwolf of house stark while bran wore grey breeches and white doublet his sleeves and collar trimmed with vair over his heart was his wolfshead brooch of silver and polished jet he would sooner have had summer than a silver wolf on his breast but ser rodrik had been unyielding the low stone steps balked dancer only for a moment when bran urged her on she took them easily beyond the wide oakandiron doors eight long rows of trestle tables filled winterfells great hall four on each side of the center aisle men crowded shoulder to shoulder on the benches stark they called as bran trotted past rising to their feet winterfell winterfell he was old enough to know that it was not truly him they shouted forit was the harvest they cheered it was robb and his victories it was his lord father and his grandfather and all the starks going back eight thousand years still it made him swell with pride for so long as it took him to ride the length of that hall he forgot that he was broken yet when he reached the dais with every eye upon him osha and hodor undid his straps and buckles lifted him off dancers back and carried him to the high seat of his fathers ser rodrik was seated to brans left his daughter beth beside him rickon was to his right his mop of shaggy auburn hair grown so long that it brushed his ermine mantle he had refused to let anyone cut it since their mother had gone the last girl to try had been bitten for her efforts i wanted to ride too he said as hodor led dancer away i ride better than you you dont so hush up he told his brother ser rodrik bellowed for quiet bran raised his voice he bid them welcome in the name of his brother the king in the north and asked them to thank the gods old and new for robbs victories and the bounty of the harvest may there be a hundred more he finished raising his fathers silver goblet a hundred more pewter tankards clay cups and ironbanded drinking horns clashed together brans wine was sweetened with honey and fragrant with cinnamon and cloves but stronger than he was used page to he could feel its hot snaky fingers wriggling through his chest as he swallowed by the time he set down the goblet his head was swimming you did well bran ser rodrik told him lord eddard would have been most proud down the table maester luwin nodded his agreement as the servers began to carry in the food such food bran had never seen course after course after course so much that he could not manage more than a bite or two of each dish there were great joints of aurochs roasted with leeks venison pies chunky with carrots bacon and mushrooms mutton chops sauced in honey and cloves savory duck peppered boar goose skewers of pigeon and capon beefandbarley stew cold fruit soup lord wyman had brought twenty casks of fish from white harbor packed in salt and seaweed whitefish and winkles crabs and mussels clams herring cod salmon lobster and lampreys there was black bread and honeycakes and oaten biscuits there were turnips and pease and beets beans and squash and huge red onions there were baked apples and berry tarts and pears poached in strongwine wheels of white cheese were set at every table above and below the salt and flagons of hot spice wine and chilled autumn ale were passed up and down the tables lord wymans musicians played bravely and well but harp and fiddle and horn were soon drowned beneath a tide of talk and laughter the clash of cup and plate and the snarling of hounds fighting for table scraps the singer sang good songs iron lances and the burning of the ships and the bear and the maiden fair but only hodor seemed to be listening he stood beside the piper hopping from one foot to the other the noise swelled to a steady rumbling roar a great heady stew of sound ser rodrik talked with maester luwin above beths curly head while rickon screamed happily at the walders bran had not wanted the freys at the high table but the maester reminded him that they would soon be kin robb was to marry one of their aunts and arya one of their uncles she never will bran said not arya but maester luwin was unyielding so there they were beside rickon the serving men brought every dish to bran first that he might take the lords portion if he chose by the time they reached the ducks he could eat no more after that he nodded approval at each course in turn and waved it away if the dish smelled especially choice he would send it to one of the lords on the dais a gesture of friendship and favor that maester luwin told him he must make he sent some salmon down to poor sad lady hornwood the boar to the boisterous umbers a dish of gooseinberries to cley cerwyn and a huge lobster to joseth the master of horse who was neither lord nor guest but had seen to dancers training and made it possible for bran to ride he sent sweets to hodor and old nan as well for no reason but he loved them ser rodrik reminded him to send something to his foster brothers so he sent little walder some boiled beets and big walder the buttered turnips on the benches below winterfell men mixed with smallfolk from the winter town friends from the nearer holdfasts and the escorts of their lordly guests some faces bran had never seen before others he knew as well as his own yet they all seemed equally foreign to him he watched them as from a distance as if he still sat in the window of his bedchamber looking down on the yard below seeing everything yet a part of nothing osha moved among the tables pouring ale one of leobald tallharts men slid a hand up under her skirts and she broke the flagon over his head to roars of laughter yet mikken had his hand down some womans bodice and she seemed not to mind bran watched farlen make his red bitch beg for bones and smiled at old nan plucking at the crust of a hot pie with wrinkled fingers on the dais lord wyman attacked a steaming plate of lampreys as if they were an enemy host he was so fat that ser rodrik had page commanded that a special wide chair be built for him to sit in but he laughed loud and often and bran thought he liked him poor wan lady hornwood sat beside him her face a stony mask as she picked listlessly at her food at the opposite end of the high table hothen and mors were playing a drinking game slamming their horns together as hard as knights meeting in joust it is too hot here and too noisy and they are all getting drunk bran itched under his grey and white woolens and suddenly he wished he were anywhere but here it is cool in the godswood now steam is rising off the hot pools and the red leaves of the weirwood are rustling the smells are richer than here and before long the moon will rise and my brother will sing to it bran ser rodrik said you do not eat the waking dream had been so vivid for a moment bran had not known where he was ill have more later he said my bellys full to bursting the old knights white mustache was pink with wine you have done well bran here and at the audiences you will be an especial fine lord one day i think i want to be a knight bran took another sip of the spiced honey wine from his fathers goblet grateful for something to clutch the lifelike head of a snarling direwolf was raised on the side of the cup he felt the silver muzzle pressing against his palm and remembered the last time he had seen his lord father drink from this goblet it had been the night of the welcoming feast when king robert had brought his court to winterfell summer still reigned then his parents had shared the dais with robert and his queen with her brothers beside her uncle benjen had been there too all in black bran and his brothers and sisters sat with the kings children joffrey and tommen and princess myrcella whod spent the whole meal gazing at robb with adoring eyes arya made faces across the table when no one was looking sansa listened raptly while the kings high harper sang songs of chivalry and rickon kept asking why jon wasnt with them because hes a bastard bran finally had to whisper to him and now they are all gone it was as if some cruel god had reached down with a great hand and swept them all away the girls to captivity jon to the wall robb and mother to war king robert and father to their graves and perhaps uncle benjen as well even down on the benches there were new men at the tables jory was dead and fat tom and porther alyn desmond hullen who had been master of horse harwin his son all those who had gone south with his father even septa mordane and vayon poole the rest had ridden to war with robb and might soon be dead as well for all bran knew he liked hayhead and poxy tym and skittrick and the other new men well enough but he missed his old friends he looked up and down the benches at all the faces happy and sad and wondered who would be missing next year and the year after he might have cried then but he couldnt he was the stark in winterfell his fathers son and his brothers heir and almost a man grown at the foot of the hall the doors opened and a gust of cold air made the torches flame brighter for an insta nt alebelly led two new guests into the feast the lady meera of house reed the rotund guardsman bellowed over the clamor with her brother jojen of greywater watch men looked up from their cups and trenchers to eye the newcomers bran heard little walder mutter frogeaters to big walder beside him ser rodrik climbed to his feet be welcome friends and share page this harvest with us serving men hurried to lengthen the table on the dais fetching trestles and chairs who are they rickon asked mudmen answered little walder disdainfully theyre thieves and cravens and they have green teeth from eating frogs maester luwin crouched beside brans seat to whisper counsel in his ear you must greet these ones warmly i had not thought to see them here but you know who they are bran nodded crannogmen from the neck howland reed was a great friend to your father ser rodrik told him these two are his it would seem as the newcomers walked the length of the hall bran saw that one was indeed a girl though he would never have known it by her dress she wore lambskin breeches soft with long use and a sleeveless jerkin armored in bronze scales though near robbs age she was slim as a boy with long brown hair knotted behind her head and only the barest suggestion of breasts a woven net hung from one slim hip a long bronze knife from the other under her arm she carried an old iron greathelm spotted with rust a frog spear and round leathern shield were strapped to her back her brother was several years younger and bore no weapons all his garb was green even to the leather of his boots and when he came closer bran saw that his eyes were the color of moss though his teeth looked as white as anyone elses both reeds were slight of build slender as swords and scarcely taller than bran himself they went to one knee before the dais my lords of stark the girl said the years have passed in their hundreds and their thousands since my folk first swore their fealty to the king in the north my lord father has sent us here to say the words again for all our people she is looking at me bran realized he had to make some answer my brother robb is fighting in the south he said but you can say your words to me if you like to winterfell we pledge the faith of greywater they said together hearth and heart and harvest we yield up to you my lord our swords and spears and arrows are yours to command grant mercy to our weak help to our helpless and justice to all and we shall never fail you i swear it by earth and water said the boy in green i swear it by bronze and iron his sister said we swear it by ice and fire they finished together bran groped for words was he supposed to swear something back to them their oath was not one he had been taught may your winters be short and your summers bountiful he said that was usually a good thing to say rise im brandon stark page the girl meera got to her feet and helped her brother up the boy stared at bran all the while we bring you gifts of fish and frog and fowl he said i thank you bran wondered if he would have to eat a frog to be polite i offer you the meat and mead of winterfell he tried to recall all he had been taught of the crannogmen who dwelt amongst the bogs of the neck and seldom left their wetlands they were a poor folk fishers and froghunters who lived in houses of thatch and woven reeds on floating islands hidden in the deeps of the swamp it was said that they were a cowardly people who fought with poisoned weapons and preferred to hide from foes rather than face them in open battle and yet howland reed had been one of fathers staunchest companions during the war for king roberts crown before bran was born the boy jojen looked about the hall curiously as he took his seat where are the direwolves in the godswood rickon answered shaggy was bad my brother would like to see them the girl said little walder spoke up loudly hed best watch they dont see him or theyll take a bite out of him they wont bite if im there bran was pleased that they wanted to see the wolves summer wont anyway and hell keep shaggydog away he was curious about these mudmen he could not recall ever seeing one before his father had sent letters to the lord of greywater over the years but none of the crannogmen had ever called at winterfell he would have liked to talk to them more but the great hall was so noisy that it was hard to hear anyone who wasnt right beside you ser rodrik was right beside bran do they truly eat frogs he asked the old knight aye ser rodrik said frogs and fish and lizardlions and all manner of birds maybe they dont have sheep and cattle bran thought he commanded the serving men to bring them mutton chops and a slice off the aurochs and fill their trenchers with beefandbarley stew they seemed to like that well enough the girl caught him staring at her and smiled bran blushed and looked away much later after all the sweets had been served and washed down with gallons of surnmerwine the food was cleared and the tables shoved back against the walls to make room for the dancing the music grew wilder the drummers joined in and hother umber brought forth a huge curved warhorn banded in silver when the singer reached the part in the night that ended where the nights watch rode forth to meet the others in the battle for the dawn he blew a blast that set all the dogs to barking two glover men began a spinning skirl on bladder and woodharp mors umber was the first on his feet he seized a passing serving girl by the arm knocking the flagon of wine out of her hands to shatter on the floor amidst the rushes and bones and bits of bread that littered the stone he whirled her and spun her and tossed her in the air the girl squealed with laughter and turned red as her skirts swirled and lifted others soon joined in hodor began to dance all by himself while lord wyman asked little beth cassel to partner him for all his size he moved gracefully when he tired cley cerwyn danced with the child in his stead ser rodrik approached lady hornwood but she made her excuses and took her leave bran watched long enough to be polite and then had hodor summoned he was hot and tired flushed from page the wine and the dancing made him sad it was something else he could never do i want to go hodor hodor shouted back kneeling maester luwin and hayhead lifted him into his basket the folk of winterfell had seen this sight half a hundred times but doubtless it looked queer to the guests some of whom were more curious than polite bran felt the stares they went out the rear rather than walk the length of the hall bran ducking his head as they passed through the lords door in the dimlit gallery outside the great hall they came upon joseth the master of horse engaged in a different sort of riding he had some woman bran did not know shoved up against the wall her skirts around her waist she was giggling until hodor stopped to watch then she screamed leave them be hodor bran had to tell him take me to my bedchamber hodor carried him up the winding steps to his tower and knelt beside one of the iron bars that mikken had driven into the wall bran used the bars to move himself to the bed and hodor pulled off his boots and breeches you can go back to the feast now but dont go bothering joseth and that woman bran said hodor hodor replied bobbing his head when he blew out his bedside candle darkness covered him like a soft familiar blanket the faint sound of music drifted through his shuttered window something his father had told him once when he was little came back to him suddenly he had asked lord eddard if the kingsguard were truly the finest knights in the seven kingdoms no longer he answered but once they were a marvel a shining lesson to the world was there one who was best of all the finest knight i ever saw was ser arthur dayne who fought with a blade called dawn forged from the heart of a fallen star they called him the sword of the morning and he would have killed me but for howland reed father had gotten sad then and he would say no more bran wished he had asked him what he meant he went to sleep with his head full of knights in gleaming armor fighting with swords that shone like starfire but when the dream came he was in the godswood again the smells from the kitchen and the great hall were so strong that it was almost as if he had never left the feast he prowled beneath the trees his brother close behind him this night was wildly alive full of the howling of the manpack at their play the sounds made him restless he wanted to run to hunt he wanted to the rattle of iron made his ears prick up his brother heard it too they raced through the undergrowth toward the sound bounding across the still water at the foot of the old white one he caught the scent of a stranger the mansmell well mixed with leather and earth and iron the intruders had pushed a few yards into the wood when he came upon them a female and a young male with no taint of fear to them even when he showed them the white of his teeth his brother growled low in his throat yet still they did not run here they come the female said meera some part of him whispered some wisp of the sleeping boy lost in the wolf dream did you know they would be so big page they will be bigger still before they are grown the young male said watching them with eyes large green and unafraid the black one is full of fear and rage but the grey is strong stronger than he knows can you feel him sister no she said moving a hand to the hilt of the long brown knife she wore go careful joien he wont hurt me this is not the day i die the male walked toward them unafraid and reached out for his muzzle a touch as light as a summer breeze yet at the brush of those fingers the wood dissolved and the very ground turned to smoke beneath his feet and swirled away laughing and then he was spinning and falling falling falling chapter caltelyn as she slept amidst the rolling grasslands catelyn dreamt that bran was whole again that arya and sansa held hands that rickon was still a babe at her breast robb crownless played with a wooden sword and when all were safe asleep she found ned in her bed smiling sweet it was sweet and gone too soon dawn came cruel a dagger of light she woke aching and alone and weary weary of riding weary of hurting weary of duty i want to weep she thought i want to be comforted im so tired of being strong i want to be foolish and frightened for once just for a small while thats all a day an hour outside her tent men were stirring she heard the whicker of horses shadd complaining of stiffness in his back ser wendel calling for his bow catelyn wished they would all go away they were good men loyal yet she was tired of them all it was her children she yearned after one day she promised herself as she lay abed one day she would allow herself to be less than strong but not today it could not be today her fingers seemed more clumsy than usual as she fumbled on her clothes she supposed she ought to be grateful that she had any use of her hands at all the dagger had been valyrian steel and valyrian steel bites deep and sharp she had only to look at the scars to remember outside shadd was stirring oats into a kettle while ser wendel manderly sat stringing his bow my lady he said when catelyn emerged there are birds in this grass would you fancy a roast quail to break your fast this morning oats and bread are sufficient for all of us i think we have many leagues yet to ride ser wendel as you will my lady the knights moon face looked crestfallen the tips of his great walrus mustache twitching with disappointment oats and bread and what could be better he was one of the fattest men catelyn had ever known but howevermuch he loved his food he loved his honor more found some nettles and brewed a tea shadd announced will mlady take a cup page yes with thanks she cradled the tea in her scarred hands and blew on it to cool it shadd was one of the winterfell men robb had sent twenty of his best to see her safely to renly he had sent five lordlings as well whose names and high birth would add weight and honor to her mission as they made their way south staying well clear of towns and holdfasts they had seen bands of mailed men more than once and glimpsed smoke on the eastern horizon but none had dared molest them they were too weak to be a threat too many to be easy prey once across the blackwater the worst was behind for the past four days they had seen no signs of war catelyn had never wanted this she had told robb as much back in riverrun when last i saw renly he was a boy no older than bran i do not know him send someone else my place is here with my father for whatever time he has left her son had looked at her unhappily there is no one else i cannot go myself your fathers too ill the blackfish is my eyes and ears i dare not lose him your brother i need to hold riverrun when we march march no one had said a word to her of marching i cannot sit at riverrun waiting for peace it makes me look as if i were afraid to take the field again when there are no battles to fight men start to think of hearth and harvest father told me that even my northmen grow restless my northmen she thought he is even starting to talk like a king no one has ever died of restlessness but rashness is another matter weve planted seeds let them grow robb shook his head stubbornly weve tossed some seeds in the wind thats all if your sister lysa was coming to aid us we would have heard by now how many birds have we sent to the eyrie four i want peace too but why should the lannisters give me anything if all i do is sit here while my army melts away around me swift as summer snow so rather than look craven you will dance to lord tywins pipes she threw back he wants you to march on harrenhal ask your uncle brynden if i said nothing of harrenhal robb said now will you go to renly for me or must i send the greatjon the memory brought a wan smile to her face such an obvious ploy that yet deft for a boy of fifteen robb knew how illsuited a man like greatjon umber would be to treat with a man like renly baratheon and he knew that she knew it as well what could she do but accede praying that her father would live until her return had lord hoster been well he would have gone himself she knew still that leavetaking was hard hard he did not even know her when she came to say farewell minisa he called her where are the children my little cat my sweet lysa catelyn had kissed him on the brow and told him his babes were well wait for me my lord she said as his eyes closed i waited for you oh so many times now you must wait for me fate drives me south and south again catelyn thought as she sipped the astringent tea when it is north i should be going north to home she had written to bran and rickon that last night at riverrun i do not forget you my sweet ones you must believe that it is only that your brother needs me more page we ought to reach the upper mander today my lady ser wendel announced while shadd spooned out the porridge lord renly will not be far if the talk be true and what do i tell him when i find him that my son holds him no true king she did not relish this meeting they needed friends not more enemies yet robb would never bend the knee in homage to a man he felt had no claim to the throne her bowl was empty though she could scarce remember tasting the porridge she laid it aside it is time we were away the sooner she spoke to renly the sooner she could turn for home she was the first one mounted and she set the pace for the column hal mollen rode beside her bearing the banner of house stark the grey direwolf on an icewhite field they were still a half days ride from renlys camp when they were taken robin flint had ranged ahead to scout and he came galloping back with word of a fareyes watching from the roof of a distant windmill by the time catelyns party reached the mill the man was long gone they pressed on covering not quite a mile before renlys outriders came swooping down on them twenty men mailed and mounted led by a grizzled greybeard of a knight with bluejays on his surcoat when he saw her banners he trotted up to her alone my lady he called i am ser colen of greenpools as it please you these are dangerous lands you cross our business is urgent she answered him i come as envoy from my son robb stark the king in the north to treat with renly baratheon the king in the south king renly is the crowned and anointed lord of all the seven kingdoms my lady ser colen answered though courteously enough his grace is encamped with his host near bitterbridge where the roseroad crosses the mander it shall be my great honor to escort you to him the knight raised a mailed hand and his men formed a double column flanking catelyn and her guard escort or captor she wondered there was nothing to be done but trust in ser colens honor and lord renlys they saw the smoke of the camps fires when they were still an hour from the river then the sound came drifting across farm and field and rolling plain indistinct as the murmur of some distant sea but swelling as they rode closer by the time they caught sight of the manders muddy waters glinting in the sun they could make out the voices of men the clatter of steel the whinny of horses yet neither sound nor smoke prepared them for the host itself thousands of cookfires filled the air with a pale smoky haze the horse lines alone stretched out over leagues a forest had surely been felled to make the tall staffs that held the banners great siege engines lined the grassy verge of the roseroad mangonels and trebuchets and rolling rams mounted on wheels taller than a man on horseback the steel points of pikes flamed red with sunlight as if already blooded while the pavilions of the knights and high lords sprouted from the grass like silken mushrooms she saw men with spears and men with swords men in steel caps and mail shirts camp followers strutting their charms archers fletching arrows teamsters driving wagons swineherds driving pigs pages running messages squires honing swords knights riding palfreys grooms leading illtempered destriers this is a fearsome lot of men ser wendel manderly observed as they crossed the ancient stone span from which bitterbridge took its name that it is catelyn agreed page near all the chivalry of the south had come to renlys call it seemed the golden rose of highgarden was seen everywhere sewn on the right breast of armsmen and servants flapping and fluttering from the green silk banners that adorned lance and pike painted upon the shields hung outside the pavilions of the sons and brothers and cousins and uncles of house tyrell as well catelyn spied the foxandflowers of house florent fossoway apples red and green lord tarlys striding huntsman oak leaves for oakheart cranes for crane a cloud of blackandorange butterflies for the mullendores across the mander the storm lords had raised their standardsrenlys own bannermen sworn to house baratheon and storms end catelyn recognized bryce carons nightingales the penrose quills and lord estermonts sea turtle green on green yet for every shield she knew there were a dozen strange to her borne by the small lords sworn to the bannermen and by hedge knights and freeriders who had come swarming to make renly baratheon a king in fact as well as name renlys own standard flew high over all from the top of his tallest siege tower a wheeled oaken immensity covered with rawhides streamed the largest war banner that catelyn had ever seena cloth big enough to carpet many a hall shimmering gold with the crowned stag of baratheon black upon it prancing proud and tall my lady do you hear that noise asked hallis mollen trotting close what is that she listened shouts and horses screaming and the clash of steel and cheering she said they had been riding up a gentle slope toward a line of brightly colored pavilions on the height as they passed between them the press of men grew thicker the sounds louder and then she saw below beneath the stoneandtimber battlements of a small castle a melee was in progress a field had been cleared off fences and galleries and tilting barriers thrown up hundreds were gathered to watch perhaps thousands from the looks of the grounds torn and muddy and littered with bits of dinted armor and broken lances they had been at it for a day or more but now the end was near fewer than a score of knights remained ahorse charging and slashing at each other as watchers and fallen combatants cheered them on she saw two destriers collide in full armor going down in a tangle of steel and horseflesh a tourney hal mollen declared he had a penchant for loudly announcing the obvious oh splendid ser wendel manderly said as a knight in a rainbowstriped cloak wheeled to deliver a backhand blow with a longhandled axe that shattered the shield of the man pursuing him and sent him reeling in his stirrups the press in front of them made further progress difficult lady stark ser colen said if your men would be so good as to wait here ill present you to the king as you say she gave the command though she had to raise her voice to be heard above the tourney din ser colen walked his horse slowly through the throngs with catelyn riding in his wake a roar went up from the crowd as a helmetless redbearded man with a griffin on his shield went down before a big knight in blue armor his steel was a deep cobalt even the blunt morningstar he wielded with such deadly effect his mount barded in the quartered sunandmoon heraldry of house tarth red ronnets down gods be damned a man cursed lorasll do for that blue a companion answered before a roar drowned out the rest of his words page another man was fallen trapped beneath his injured horse both of them screaming in pain squires rushed out to aid them this is madness catelyn thought real enemies on every side and half the realm in flames and renly sits here playing at war like a boy with his first wooden sword the lords and ladies in the gallery were as engrossed in the melee as the men on the ground catelyn marked them well her father had oft treated with the southron lords and not a few had been guests at riverrun she recognized lord mathis rowan stouter and more florid than ever the golden tree of his house spread across his white doublet below him sat lady oakheart tiny and delicate and to her left lord randyll tarly of horn hill his greatsword heartsbane propped up against the back of his seat others she knew only by their sigils and some not at all in their midst watching and laughing with his young queen by his side sat a ghost in a golden crown small wonder the lords gather around him with such fervor she thought he is robert come again renly was handsome as robert had been handsome long of limb and broad of shoulder with the same coalblack hair fine and straight the same deep blue eyes the same easy smile the slender circlet around his brows seemed to suit him well it was soft gold a ring of roses exquisitely wrought at the front lifted a stags head of dark green jade adorned with golden eyes and golden antlers the crowned stag decorated the kings green velvet tunic as well worked in gold thread upon his chest the baratheon sigil in the colors of highgarden the girl who shared the high seat with him was also of highgarden his young queen margaery daughter to lord mace tyrell their marriage was the mortar that held the great southron alliance together catelyn knew renly was oneandtwenty the girl no older than robb very pretty with a does soft eyes and a mane of curling brown hair that fell about her shoulders in lazy ringlets her smile was shy and sweet out in the field another man lost his seat to the knight in the rainbowstriped cloak and the king shouted approval with the rest loras she heard him call loras highgarden the queen clapped her hands together in excitement catelyn turned to see the end of it only four men were left in the fight now and there was small doubt whom king and commons favored she had never met ser loras tyrell but even in the distant north one heard tales of the prowess of the young knight of flowers ser loras rode a tall white stallion in silver mail and fought with a longhandled axe a crest of golden roses ran down the center of his helm two of the other survivors had made common cause they spurred their mounts toward the knight in the cobalt armor as they closed to either side the blue knight reined hard smashing one man full in the face with his splintered shield while his black destrier lashed out with a steelshod hoof at the other in a blink one combatant was unhorsed the other reeling the blue knight let his broken shield drop to the ground to free his left arm and then the knight of flowers was on him the weight of his steel seemed to hardly diminish the grace and quickness with which ser loras moved his rainbow cloak swirling about him the white horse and the black one wheeled like lovers at a harvest dance the riders throwing steel in place of kisses longaxe flashed and morningstar whirled both weapons were blunted yet still they raised an awful clangor shieldless the blue knight was getting much the worse of it ser loras rained down blows on his head and shoulders to shouts of highgarden from the throng the other gave page answer with his morningstar but whenever the ball came crashing in ser loras interposed his battered green shield emblazoned with three golden roses when the longaxe caught the blue knights hand on the backswing and sent the morningstar flying from his grasp the crowd screamed like a rutting beast the knight of flowers raised his axe for the final blow the blue knight charged into it the stallions slammed together the blunted axehead smashed against the scarred blue breastplate but somehow the blue knight had the haft locked between steelgauntleted fingers he wrenched it from ser lorass hand and suddenly the two were grappling mounttomount and an instant later they were falling as their horses pulled apart they crashed to the ground with bonejarring force loras tyrell on the bottom took the brunt of the impact the blue knight pulled a long dirk free and flicked open tyrells visor the roar of the crowd was too loud for catelyn to hear what ser loras said but she saw the word form on his split bloody lips yield the blue knight climbed unsteady to his feet and raised his dirk in the direction of renly baratheon the salute of a champion to his king squires dashed onto the field to help the vanquished knight to his feet when they got his helm off catelyn was startled to see how young he was he could not have had more than two years on robb the boy might have been as comely as his sister but the broken lip unfocused eyes and blood trickling through his matted hair made it hard to be certain approach king renly called to the champion he limped toward the gallery at close hand the brilliant blue armor looked rather less splendid everywhere it showed scars the dents of mace and warhammer the long gouges left by swords chips in the enameled breastplate and helm his cloak hung in rags from the way he moved the man within was no less battered a few voices hailed him with cries of tarth and oddly a beauty a beauty but most were silent the blue knight knelt before the king grace he said his voice muffled by his dented greathelm you are all your lord father claimed you were renlys voice carried over the field ive seen ser loras unhorsed once or twice but never quite in that fashion that were no proper unhorsing complained a drunken archer nearby a tyrell rose sewn on his jerkin a vile trick pulling the lad down the press had begun to open up ser colen catelyn said to her escort who is this man and why do they mislike him so ser colen frowned because he is no man my lady thats brienne of tarth daughter to lord selwyn the evenstar daughter catelyn was horrified brienne the beauty they name her though not to her face lest they be called upon to defend those words with their bodies she heard king renly declare the lady brienne of tarth the victor of the great melee at bitterbridge last mounted of one hundred sixteen knights as champion you may ask of me any boon that you desire if it lies in my power it is yours your grace brienne answered i ask the honor of a place among your rainbow guard i would be one of your seven and pledge my life to yours to go where you go ride at your side and keep you safe page from all hurt and harm done he said rise and remove your helm she did as he bid her and when the greathelm was lifted catelyn understood ser colens words beauty they called her mocking the hair beneath the visor was a squirrels nest of dirty straw and her face briennes eyes were large and very blue a young girls eyes trusting and guileless but the rest her features were broad and coarse her teeth prominent and crooked her mouth too wide her lips so plump they seemed swollen a thousand freckles speckled her cheeks and brow and her nose had been broken more than once pity filled catelyns heart is there any creature on earth as unfortunate as an ugly woman and yet when renly cut away her torn cloak and fastened a rainbow in its place brienne of tarth did not look unfortunate her smile lit up her face and her voice was strong and proud as she said my life for yours your grace from this day on i am your shield i swear it by the old gods and the new the way she looked at the kinglooked down at him she was a good hand higher though renly was near as tall as his brother had beenwas painful to see your grace ser colen of greenpools swung down off his horse to approach the gallery i beg your leave he went to one knee i have the honor to bring you the lady catelyn stark sent as envoy by her son robb lord of winterfell lord of winterfell and king in the north ser catelyn corrected him she dismounted and moved to ser colens side king renly looked surprised lady catelyn we are most pleased he turned to his young queen margaery my sweet this is the lady catelyn stark of winterfell you are most welcome here lady stark the girl said all soft courtesy i am sorry for your loss you are kind said catelyn my lady i swear to you i will see that the lannisters answer for your husbands murder the king declared when i take kings landing ill send you cerseis head and will that bring my ned back to me she thought it will be enough to know that justice has been done my lord your grace brienne the blue corrected sharply and you should kneel when you approach the king the distance between a lord and a grace is a small one my lady catelyn said lord renly wears a crown as does my son if you wish we may stand here in the mud and debate what honors and titles are rightly due to each but it strikes me that we have more pressing matters to consider some of renlys lords bristled at that but the king only laughed well said my lady there will be time enough for graces when these wars are done tell me when does your son mean to march against harrenhal page until she knew whether this king was friend or foe catelyn was not about to reveal the least part of robbs dispositions i do not sit on my sons war councils my lord so long as he leaves a few lannisters for me ill not complain what has he done with the kingslayer jaime lannister is held prisoner at riverrun still alive lord mathis rowan seemed dismayed bemused renly said it would seem the direwolf is gentler than the lion gentler than the lannisters murmured lady oakheart with a bitter smile is drier than the sea i call it weak lord randyll tarly had a short bristly grey beard and a reputation for blunt speech no disrespect to you lady stark but it would have been more seemly had lord robb come to pay homage to the king himself rather than hiding behind his mothers skirts king robb is warring my lord catelyn replied with icy courtesy not playing at tourney renly grinned go softly lord randyll i fear youre overmatched he summoned a steward in the livery of storms end find a place for the ladys companions and see that they have every comfort lady catelyn shall have my own pavilion since lord caswell has been so kind as to give me use of his castle i have no need of it my lady when you are rested i would be honored if you would share our meat and mead at the feast lord caswell is giving us tonight a farewell feast i fear his lordship is eager to see the heels of my hungry horde not true your grace protested a wispy young man who must have been caswell what is mine is yours whenever someone said that to my brother robert he took them at their word renly said do you have daughters yes your grace two then thank the gods that i am not robert my sweet queen is all the woman i desire renly held out his hand to help margaery to her feet well talk again when youve had a chance to refresh yourself lady catelyn renly led his bride back toward the castle while his steward conducted catelyn to the kings green silk pavilion if you have need of anything you have only to ask my lady catelyn could scarcely imagine what she might need that had not already been provided the pavilion was larger than the common rooms of many an inn and furnished with every comfort feather mattress and sleeping furs a woodandcopper tub large enough for two braziers to keep off the nights chill slung leather camp chairs a writing table with quills and inkpot bowls of peaches plums and pears a flagon of wine with a set of matched silver cups cedar chests packed full of renlys clothing books maps game boards a high harp a tall bow and a quiver of arrows a pair of redtailed hunting hawks a vertible armory of fine weapons he does not stint himself this renly she thought as she looked about small wonder this host moves so slowly beside the entrance the kings armor stood sentry a suit of forestgreen plate its fittings chased with page gold the helm crowned by a great rack of golden antlers the steel was polished to such a high sheen that she could see her reflection in the breastplate gazing back at her as if from the bottom of a deep green pond the face of a drowned woman catelyn thought can you drown in grief she turned away sharply angry with her own frailty she had no time for the luxury of selfpity she must wash the dust from her hair and change into a gown more fitting for a kings feast ser wendel manderly lucas blackwood ser perwyn frey and the rest of her highborn companions accompanied her to the castle the great hall of lord caswells keep was great only by courtesy yet room was found on the crowded benches for catelyns men amidst renlys own knights catelyn was assigned a place on the dais between redfaced lord mathis rowan and genial ser jon fossoway of the greenapple fossoways ser jon made jests while lord mathis inquired politely after the health of her father brother and children brienne of tarth had been seated at the far end of the high table she did not gown herself as a lady but chose a knights finery instead a velvet doublet quartered roseandazure breeches and boots and a finetooled swordbelt her new rainbow cloak flowing down her back no garb could disguise her plainness though the huge freckled hands the wide flat face the thrust of her teeth out of armor her body seemed ungainly broad of hip and thick of limb with hunched muscular shoulders but no bosom to speak of and it was clear from her every action that brienne knew it and suffered for it she spoke only in answer and seldom lifted her gaze from her food of food there was plenty the war had not touched the fabled bounty of highgarden while singers sang and tumblers tumbled they began with pears poached in wine and went on to tiny savory fish rolled in salt and cooked crisp and capons stuffed with onions and mushrooms there were great loaves of brown bread mounds of turnips and sweetcorn and pease immense hams and roast geese and trenchers dripping full of venison stewed with beer and barley for the sweet lord caswells servants brought down trays of pastries from his castle kitchens cream swans and spunsugar unicorns lemon cakes in the shape of roses spiced honey biscuits and blackberry tarts apple crisps and wheels of buttery cheese the rich foods made catelyn queasy but it would never do to show frailty when so much depended on her strength she ate sparingly while she watched this man who would be king renly sat with his young bride on his left hand and her brother on the right apart from the white linen bandage around his brow ser loras seemed none the worse for the days misadventures he was indeed as comely as catelyn had suspected he might be when not glazed his eyes were lively and intelligent his hair an artless tumble of brown locks that many a maid might have envied he had replaced his tattered tourney cloak with a new one the same brilliantly striped silk of renlys rainbow guard clasped with the golden rose of highgarden from time to time king renly would feed margaery some choice morsel off the point of his dagger or lean over to plant the lightest of kisses on her cheek but it was ser loras who shared most of his jests and confidences the king enjoyed his food and drink that was plain to see yet he seemed neither glutton nor drunkard he laughed often and well and spoke amiably to highborn lords and lowly serving wenches alike some of his guests were less moderate they drank too much and boasted too loudly to her mind lord willums sons josua and elyas disputed heatedly about who would be first over the walls of kings landing lord varner dandled a serving girl on his lap nuzzling at her neck while one hand went exploring down her bodice guyard the green who fancied himself a singer diddled a harp and gave page them a verse about tying lions tails in knots parts of which rhymed ser mark mullendore brought a blackandwhite monkey and fed him morsels from his own plate while ser tanton of the redapple fossoways climbed on the table and swore to slay sandor clegane in single combat the vow might have been taken more solemnly if ser tanton had not had one foot in a gravy boat when he made it the height of folly was reached when a plump fool came capering out in goldpainted tin with a cloth lions head and chased a dwarf around the tables whacking him over the head with a bladder finally king renly demanded to know why he was beating his brother why your grace im the kinslayer the fool said its kingslayer fool of a fool renly said and the hall rang with laughter lord rowan beside her did not join the merriment they are all so young he said it was true the knight of flowers could not have reached his second name day when robert slew prince rhaegar on the trident few of the others were very much older they had been babes during the sack of kings landing and no more than boys when balon greyjoy raised the iron islands in rebellion they are still unblooded catelyn thought as she watched lord bryce goad ser robar into juggling a brace of daggers it is all a game to them still a tourney writ large and all they see is the chance for glory and honor and spoils they are boys drunk on song and story and like all boys they think themselves immortal war will make them old catelyn said as it did us she had been a girl when robert and ned and jon arryn raised their banners against aerys targaryen a woman by the time the fighting was done i pity them why lord rowan asked her look at them theyre young and strong full of life and laughter and lust aye more lust than they know what to do with there will be many a bastard bred this night i promise you why pity because it will not last catelyn answered sadly because they are the knights of summer and winter is coming lady catelyn you are wrong brienne regarded her with eyes as blue as her armor winter will never come for the likes of us should we die in battle they will surely sing of us and its always summer in the songs in the songs all knights are gallant all maids are beautiful and the sun is always shining winter comes for all of us catelyn thought for me it came when ned died it will come for you too child and sooner than you like she did not have the heart to say it the king saved her lady catelyn renly called down i feel the need of some air will you walk with me catelyn stood at once i should be honored brienne was on her feet as well your grace give me but a moment to don my mail you should not be without protection king renly smiled if i am not safe in the heart of lord caswells castle with my own host around me one sword will make no matter not even your sword brienne sit and eat if i have need of you ill page send for you his words seemed to strike the girl harder than any blow she had taken that afternoon as you will your grace brienne sat eyes downcast renly took catelyns arm and led her from the hall past a slouching guardsman who straightened so hurriedly that he near dropped his spear renly clapped the man on the shoulder and made a jest of it this way my lady the king took her through a low door into a stair tower as they started up he said perchance is ser barristan selmy with your son at riverrun no she answered puzzled is he no longer with joffrey he was the lord commander of the kingsguard renly shook his head the lannisters told him he was too old and gave his cloak to the hound im told he left kings landing vowing to take up service with the true king that cloak brienne claimed today was the one i was keeping for selmy in hopes that he might offer me his sword when he did not turn up at highgarden i thought perhaps he had gone to riverrun instead we have not seen him he was old yes but a good man still i hope he has not come to harm the lannisters are great fools they climbed a few more steps on the night of roberts death i offered your husband a hundred swords and urged him to take joffrey into his power had he listened he would be regent today and there would have been no need for me to claim the throne ned refused you she did not have to be told he had sworn to protect roberts children renly said i lacked the strength to act alone so when lord eddard turned me away i had no choice but to flee had i stayed i knew the queen would see to it that i did not long outlive my brother had you stayed and lent your support to ned he might still be alive catelyn thought bitterly i liked your husband well enough my lady he was a loyal friend to robert i know but he would not listen and he would not bend here i wish to show you something they had reached the top of the stairwell renly pushed open a wooden door and they stepped out onto the roof lord caswells keep was scarcely tall enough to call a tower but the country was low and flat and catelyn could see for leagues in all directions wherever she looked she saw fires they covered the earth like fallen stars and like the stars there was no end to them count them if you like my lady renly said quietly you will still be counting when dawn breaks in the east how many fires burn around riverrun tonight i wonder catelyn could hear faint music drifting from the great hall seeping out into the night she dare not count the stars im told your son crossed the neck with twenty thousand swords at his back renly went on now that the lords of the trident are with him perhaps he commands forty thousand no she thought not near so many we have lost men in battle and others to the harvest page i have twice that number here renly said and this is only part of my strength mace tyrell remains at highgarden with another ten thousand i have a strong garrison holding storms end and soon enough the dornishmen will join me with all their power and never forget my brother stannis who holds dragonstone and commands the lords of the narrow sea it would seem that you are the one who has forgotten stannis catelyn said more sharply than shed intended his claim you mean renly laughed let us be blunt my lady stannis would make an appalling king nor is he like to become one men respect stannis even fear him but precious few have ever loved him he is still your elder brother if either of you can be said to have a right to the iron throne it must be lord stannis renly shrugged tell me what right did my brother robert ever have to the iron throne he did not wait for an answer oh there was talk of the blood ties between baratheon and targaryen of weddings a hundred years past of second sons and elder daughters no one but the maesters care about any of it robert won the throne with his warhammer he swept a hand across the campfires that burned from horizon to horizon well there is my claim as good as roberts ever was if your son supports me as his father supported robert hell not find me ungenerous i will gladly confirm him in all his lands titles and honors he can rule in winterfell as he pleases he can even go on calling himself king in the north if he likes so long as he bends the knee and does me homage as his overlord king is only a word but fealty loyalty service those i must have and if he will not give them to you my lord i mean to be king my lady and not of a broken kingdom i cannot say it plainer than that three hundred years ago a stark king knelt to aegon the dragon when he saw he could not hope to prevail that was wisdom your son must be wise as well once he joins me this war is good as done we renly broke off suddenly distracted whats this now the rattle of chains heralded the raising of the portcullis down in the yard below a rider in a winged helm urged his welllathered horse under the spikes summon the king he called renly vaulted up into a crenel im here ser your grace the rider spurred his mount closer i came swift as i could from storms end we are besieged your grace ser cortnay defies them but but thats not possible i would have been told if lord tywin left harrenhal these are no larmisters my liege its lord stannis at your gates king stannis he calls himself now chapter jon page a blowing rain lashed at jons face as he spurred his horse across the swollen stream beside him lord commander mormont gave the hood of his cloak a tug muttering curses on the weather his raven sat on his shoulder feathers ruffled as soaked and grumpy as the old bear himself a gust of wind sent wet leaves flapping round them like a flock of dead birds the haunted forest jon thought ruefully the drowned forest more like it he hoped sam was holding up back down the column he was not a good rider even in fair weather and six days of rain had made the ground treacherous all soft mud and hidden rocks when the wind blew it drove the water right into their eyes the wall would be flowing off to the south the melting ice mingling with warm rain to wash down in sheets and rivers pyp and toad would be sitting near the fire in the common room drinking cups of mulled wine before their supper jon envied them his wet wool clung to him sodden and itching his neck and shoulders ached fiercely from the weight of mail and sword and he was sick of salt cod salt beef and hard cheese up ahead a hunting horn sounded a quavering note half drowned beneath the constant patter of the rain buckwells horn the old bear announced the gods are good crasters still there his raven gave a single flap of his big wings croaked corn and ruffled his feathers up again jon had often heard the black brothers tell tales of craster and his keep now he would see it with his own eyes after seven empty villages they had all come to dread finding crasters as dead and desolate as the rest but it seemed they would be spared that perhaps the old bear will finally get some answers he thought anyway well be out of the rain thoren smallwood swore that craster was a friend to the watch despite his unsavory reputation the mans halfmad i wont deny it hed told the old bear but youd be the same if youd spent your life in this cursed wood even so hes never turned a ranger away from his fire nor does he love mance rayder hell give us good counsel so long as he gives us a hot meal and a chance to dry our clothes ill be happy dywen said craster was a kinslayer liar raper and craven and hinted that he trafficked with slavers and demons and worse the old forester would add clacking his wooden teeth theres a cold smell to that one there is jon lord mormont commanded ride back along the column and spread the word and remind the officers that i want no trouble about crasters wives the men are to mind their hands and speak to these women as little as need be aye my lord jon turned his horse back the way theyd come it was pleasant to have the rain out of his face if only for a little while everyone he passed seemed to be weeping the march was strung out through half a mile of woods in the midst of the baggage train jon passed samwell tarly slumped in his saddle under a wide floppy hat he was riding one dray horse and leading the others the drumming of the rain against the hoods of their cages had the ravens squawking and fluttering you put a fox in with them jon called out water ran off the brim of sams hat as he lifted his head oh hullo jon no they just hate the rain the same as us page how are you faring sam wetly the fat boy managed a smile nothing has killed me yet though good crasters keep is just ahead if the gods are good hell let us sleep by his fire sam looked dubious dolorous edd says crasters a terrible savage he marries his daughters and obeys no laws but those he makes himself and dywen told grenn hes got black blood in his veins his mother was a wildling woman who lay with a ranger so hes a bas suddenly he realized what he was about to say a bastard jon said with a laugh you can say it sam ive heard the word before he put the spurs to his surefooted little garron i need to hunt down ser ottyn be careful around crasters women as if samwell tarly needed warning on that score well talk later after weve made camp jon carried the word back to ser ottyn wythers plodding along with the rear guard a small prunefaced man of an age with mormont ser ottyn always looked tired even at castle black and the rain had beaten him down unmercifully welcome tidings he said this wet has soaked my bones and even my saddle sores complain of saddle sores on his way back jon swung wide of the columns line of march and took a shorter path through the thick of the wood the sounds of man and horse diminished swallowed up by the wet green wild and soon enough he could hear only the steady wash of rain against leaf and tree and rock it was midafternoon yet the forest seemed as dark as dusk jon wove a path between rocks and puddles past great oaks greygreen sentinels and blackbarked ironwoods in places the branches wove a canopy overhead and he was given a moments respite from the drumming of the rain against his head as he rode past a lightningblasted chestnut tree overgrown with wild white roses he heard something rustling in the underbrush ghost he called out ghost to me but it was dywen who emerged from the greenery forking a shaggy grey garron with grenn ahorse beside him the old bear had deployed outriders to either side of the main column to screen their march and warn of the approach of any enemies and even there he took no chances sending the men out in pairs ah its you lord snow dywen smiled an oaken smile his teeth were carved of wood and fit badly thought me and the boy had us one o them others to deal with lose your wolf hes off hunting ghost did not like to travel with the column but he would not be far when they made camp for the night hed find his way to jon at the lord commanders tent fishing id call it in this wet dywen said my mother always said rain was good for growing crops grenn put in hopefully aye a good crop of mildew dywen said the best thing about a rain like this it saves a man from taking baths he made a clacking sound on his wooden teeth buckwells found craster jon told them page had he lost him dywen chuckled see that you young bucks dont go nosing about crasters wives you hear jon smiled want them all for yourself dywen dywen clacked his teeth some more might be i do crasters got ten fingers and one cock so he dont count but to eleven hed never miss a couple how many wives does he have truly grenn asked moren you ever will brother well its not so hard when you breed your own theres your beast snow ghost was trotting along beside jons horse with tail held high his white fur ruffed up thick against the rain he moved so silently jon could not have said just when he appeared grenns mount shied at the scent of him even now after more than a year the horses were uneasy in the presence of the direwolf with me ghost jon spurred off to crasters keep he had never thought to find a stone castle on the far side of the wall but he had pictured some sort of motteandbailey with a wooden palisade and a timber tower keep what they found instead was a midden heap a pigsty an empty sheepfold and a windowless daubandwattle hall scarce worthy of the name it was long and low chinked together from logs and roofed with sod the compound stood atop a rise too modest to name a hill surrounded by an earthen dike brown rivulets flowed down the slope where the rain had eaten gaping holes in the defenses to join a rushing brook that curved around to the north its thick waters turned into a murky torrent by the rains on the southwest he found an open gate flanked by a pair of animal skulls on high poles a bear to one side a ram to the other bits of flesh still clung to the bear skull jon noted as he joined the line riding past within jarmen buckwells scouts and men from thoren smallwoods van were setting up horse lines and struggling to raise tents a host of piglets rooted about three huge sows in the sty nearby a small girl pulled carrots from a garden naked in the rain while two women tied a pig for slaughter the animals squeals were high and horrible almost human in their distress chetts hounds barked wildly in answer snarling and snapping despite his curses with a pair of crasters dogs barking back when they saw ghost some of the dogs broke off and ran while others began to bay and growl the direwolf ignored them as did jon well thirty of us will be warm and dry jon thought once hed gotten a good look at the hall perhaps as many as fifty the place was much too small to sleep two hundred men so most would need to remain outside and where to put them the rain had turned half the compound yard to ankledeep puddles and the rest to sucking mud another dismal night was in prospect the lord commander had entrusted his mount to dolorous edd he was cleaning mud out of the horses hooves as jon dismounted lord mormonts in the hall he announced he said for you to join him best leave the wolf outside he looks hungry enough to eat one of crasters children well truth be told im hungry enough to eat one of crasters children so long as he was served hot go on ill see to your horse if its warm and dry inside dont tell me i wasnt asked in he flicked a glob of wet mud out from under a horseshoe does this mud look like shit to you could it be that this whole hill is made of crasters shit jon smiled well i hear hes been here a long time page you cheer me not go see the old bear ghost stay he commanded the door to crasters keep was made of two flaps of deerhide jon shoved between them stooping to pass under the low lintel two dozen of the chief rangers had preceded him and were standing around the firepit in the center of the dirt floor while puddles collected about their boots the hall stank of soot dung and wet dog the air was heavy with smoke yet somehow still damp rain leaked through the smoke hole in the roof it was all a single room with a sleeping loft above reached by a pair of splintery ladders jon remembered how hed felt the day they had left the wall nervous as a maiden but eager to glimpse the mysteries and wonders beyond each new horizon well heres one of the wonders he told himself gazing about the squalid foulsmelling hall the acrid smoke was making his eyes water a pity that pyp and toad cant see all theyre missing craster sat above the fire the only man to enjoy his own chair even lord commander mormont must seat himself on the common bench with his raven muttering on his shoulder jarman buckwell stood behind dripping from patched mail and shiny wet leather beside thoren smallwood in the late ser jaremys heavy breastplate and sabletrimmed cloak crasters sheepskin jerkin and cloak of sewn skins made a shabby contrast but around one thick wrist was a heavy ring that had the glint of gold he looked to be a powerful man though well into the winter of his days now his mane of hair grey going to white a flat nose and a drooping mouth gave him a cruel look and one of his ears was missing so this is a wildling jon remembered old nans tales of the savage folk who drank blood from human skulls craster seemed to be drinking a thin yellow beer from a chipped stone cup perhaps he had not heard the stories ive not seen benjen stark for three years he was telling mormont and if truth be told i never once missed him a halfdozen black puppies and the odd pig or two skulked among the benches while women in ragged deerskins passed horns of beer stirred the fire and chopped carrots and onions into a kettle he ought to have passed here last year said thoren smallwood a dog came sniffing round his leg he kicked it and sent it off yipping lord mormont said ben was searching for ser waymar royce whod vanished with gared and young will aye those three i recall the lordling no older than one of these pups too proud to sleep under my roof him in his sable cloak and black steel my wives give him big cow eyes all the same he turned his squint on the nearest of the women gared says they were chasing raiders i told him with a commander that green best not catch em gared wasnt halfbad for a crow had less ears than me that one the bite took em same as mine craster laughed now i hear he got no head neither the bite do that too jon remembered a spray of red blood on white snow and the way theon greyjoy had kicked the dead mans head the man was a deserter on the way back to winterfell jon and robb had raced and found six direwolf pups in the snow a thousand years ago when ser waymar left you where was he bound page craster gave a shrug happens i have better things to do than tend to the comings and goings of crows he drank a pull of beer and set the cup aside had no good southron wine up here for a bears night i could use me some wine and a new axe mines lost its bite cant have that i got me women to protect he gazed around at his scurrying wives you are few here and isolated mormont said if you like ill detail some men to escort you south to the wall the raven seemed to like the notion wall it screamed spreading black wings like a high collar behind mormonts head their host gave a nasty smile showing a mouthful of broken brown teeth and what would we do there serve you at supper were free folk here craster serves no man these are bad times to dwell alone in the wild the cold winds are rising let them rise my roots are sunk deep craster grabbed a passing woman by the wrist tell him wife tell the lord crow how well content we are the woman licked at thin lips this is our place craster keeps us safe better to die free than live a slave slave muttered the raven mormont leaned forward every village we have passed has been abandoned yours are the first living faces weve seen since we left the wall the people are gone whether dead fled or taken i could not say the animals as well nothing is left and earlier we found the bodies of two of ben starks rangers only a few leagues from the wall they were pale and cold with black hands and black feet and wounds that did not bleed yet when we took them back to castle black they rose in the night and killed one slew ser jaremy rykker and the other came for me which tells me that they remember some of what they knew when they lived but there was no human mercy left in them the womans mouth hung open a wet pink cave but craster only gave a snort weve had no such troubles here and ill thank you not to tell such evil tales under my roof im a godly man and the gods keep me safe if wights come walking ill know how to send them back to their graves though i could use me a sharp new axe he sent his wife scurrying with a slap on her leg and a shout of more beer and be quick about it no trouble from the dead jarmen buckwell said but what of the living my lord what of your king king cried mormonts raven king king king that mance rayder craster spit into the fire kingbeyondthewall what do free folk want with kings he turned his squint on mormont theres much i could tell you o rayder and his doings if i had a mind this o the empty villages thats his work you would have found this hall abandoned as well if i were a man to scrape to such he sends a rider tells me i must leave my own keep to come grovel at his feet i sent the man back but kept his tongue its nailed to that wall there he pointed might be that i could tell you where to seek mance rayder if i had a mind the brown smile again but well have time enough for that youll be wanting to sleep beneath my roof belike and eat me out page of pigs a roof would be most welcome my lord mormont said weve had hard riding and too much wet then youll guest here for a night no longer im not that fond o crows the lofts for me and mine but youll have all the floor you like ive meat and beer for twenty no more the rest o your black crows can peck after their own corn weve packed in our own supplies my lord said the old bear we should be pleased to share our food and wine craster wiped his drooping mouth with the back of a hairy hand ill taste your wine lord crow that i will one more thing any man lays a hand on my wives he loses the hand your roof your rule said thoren smallwood and lord mormont nodded stiffly though he looked none too pleased thats settled then craster grudged them a grunt dya have a man can draw a map sam tarly can ion pushed forward sam loves maps mormont beckoned him closer send him here after hes eaten have him bring quill and parchment and find tollett as well tell him to bring my axe a guest gift for our host whos this one now craster said before jon could go he has the look of a stark my steward and squire jon snow a bastard is it craster looked jon up and down man wants to bed a woman seems like he ought to take her to wife thats what i do he shooed jon off with a wave well run and do your service bastard and see that axe is good and sharp now ive no use for dull steel jon snow bowed stiffly and took his leave ser ottyn wythers was coming in as he was leaving and they almost collided at the deerhide door outside the rain seemed to have slackened tents had gone up all over the compound jon could see the tops of others under the trees dolorous edd was feeding the horses give the wildling an axe why not he pointed out mormonts weapon a shorthafted battleaxe with gold scrollwork inlaid on the black steel blade hell give it back i vow buried in the old bears skull like as not why not give him all our axes and our swords as well i mislike the way they clank and rattle as we ride wed travel faster without them straight to hells door does it rain in hell i wonder perhaps craster would like a nice hat instead jon smiled he wants an axe and wine as well see the old bears clever if we get the wildling well and truly drunk perhaps hell only cut off an ear when he tries to slay us with that axe i have two ears but only one head smallwood says craster is a friend to the watch page do you know the difference between a wildling whos a friend to the watch and one whos not asked the dour squire our enemies leave our bodies for the crows and the wolves our friends bury us in secret graves i wonder how long that bears been nailed up on that gate and what craster had there before we came hallooing edd looked at the axe doubtfully the rain running down his long face is it dry in there drier than out here if i lurk about after not too close to the fire belike theyll take no note of me till morn the ones under his roof will be the first he murders but at least well die dry jon had to laugh crasters one man were two hundred i doubt hell murder anyone you cheer me said edd sounding utterly morose and besides theres much to be said for a good sharp axe id hate to be murdered with a maul i saw a man hit in the brow with a maul once scarce split the skin at all but his head turned mushy and swelled up big as a gourd only purplyred a comely man but he died ugly its good that were not giving them mauls edd walked away shaking his head his sodden black cloak shedding rain behind him jon got the horses fed before he stopped to think of his own supper he was wondering where to find sam when he heard a shout of fear wolf he sprinted around the hall toward the cry the earth sucking at his boots one of crasters women was backed up against the mudspattered wall of the keep keep away she was shouting at ghost you keep away the direwolf had a rabbit in his mouth and another dead and bloody on the ground before him get it away mlord she pleaded when she saw him he wont hurt you he knew at once what had happened a wooden hutch its slats shattered lay on its side in the wet grass he must have been hungry we havent seen much game ion whistled the direwolf bolted down the rabbit crunching the small bones between his teeth and padded over to him the woman regarded them with nervous eyes she was younger than hed thought at first a girl of fifteen or sixteen years he judged dark hair plastered across a gaunt face by the falling rain her bare feet muddy to the ankles the body under the sewn skins was showing in the early turns of pregnancy are you one of crasters daughters he asked she put a hand over her belly wife now edging away from the wolf she knelt mournfully beside the broken hutch i was going to breed them rabbits theres no sheep left the watch will make good for them jon had no coin of his own or he would have offered it to her though he was not sure what good a few coppers or even a silver piece would do her beyond the wall ill speak to lord mormont on the morrow she wiped her hands on her skirt miord im no lord but others had come crowding round drawn by the womans scream and the crash of the rabbit hutch dont you believe him girl called out lark the sisterman a ranger mean as a cur thats lord snow himself page bastard of winterfell and brother to kings mocked chett whod left his hounds to see what the commotion was about that wolfs looking at you hungry girl lark said might be it fancies that tender bit in your belly jon was not amused youre scaring her warning her more like chetts grin was as ugly as the boils that covered most of his face were not to talk to you the girl remembered suddenly wait jon said too late she bolted ran lark made a grab for the second rabbit but ghost was quicker when he bared his teeth the sisterman slipped in the mud and went down on his bony butt the others laughed the direwolf took the rabbit in his mouth and brought it to jon there was no call to scare the girl he told them well hear no scolds from you bastard chett blamed jon for the loss of his comfortable position with maester aemon and not without justice if he had not gone to aemon about sam tarly chett would still be tending an old blind man instead of a pack of illtempered hunting hounds you may be the lord commanders pet but youre not the lord commander and you wouldnt talk so bloody bold without that monster of yours always about ill not fight a brother while were beyond the wall jon answered his voice cooler than he felt lark got to one knee hes afraid of you chett on the sisters we have a name for them like him i know all the names save your breath he walked away ghost at his side the rain had dwindled to a thin drizzle by the time he reached the gate dusk would be on them soon followed by another wet dark dismal night the clouds would hide moon and stars and mormonts torch turning the woods black as pitch every piss would be an adventure if not quite of the sort jon snow had once envisioned out under the trees some rangers had found enough duff and dry wood to start a fire beneath a slanting ridge of slate others had raised tents or made rude shelters by stretching their cloaks over low branches giant had crammed himself inside the hollow of a dead oak how dye like my castle lord snow it looks snug you know where sam is keep on the way you were if you come on ser ottyns pavilion youve gone too far giant smiled unless sams found him a tree too what a tree that would be it was ghost who found sam in the end the direwolf shot ahead like a quarrel from a crossbow under an outcrop of rock that gave some small degree of shelter from the rain sam was feeding the ravens his boots squished when he moved my feet are soaked through he admitted miserably when i climbed off my horse i stepped in a hole and went in up to my knees take off your boots and dry your stockings ill find some dry wood if the grounds not wet under the rock we might be able to get a fire burning jon showed sam the rabbit and well feast page wont you be attending lord mormont in the hall no but you will the old bear wants you to map for him craster says hell find mance rayder for us oh sam did not look anxious to meet craster even if it meant a warm fire he said eat first though dry your feet jon went to gather fuel digging down under deadfalls for the drier wood beneath and peeling back layers of sodden pine needles until he found likely kindling even then it seemed to take forever for a spark to catch he hung his cloak from the rock to keep the rain off his smoky little fire making them a small snug alcove as he knelt to skin the rabbit sam pulled off his boots i think theres moss growing between my toes he declared mournfully wriggling the toes in question the rabbit will taste good i dont even mind about the blood and all he looked away well only a little jon spitted the carcass banked the fire with a pair of rocks and balanced their meal atop them the rabbit had been a scrawny thing but as it cooked it smelled like a kings feast other rangers gave them envious looks even ghost looked up hungrily flames shining in his red eyes as he sniffed you had yours before jon reminded him is craster as savage as the rangers say sam asked the rabbit was a shade underdone but tasted wonderful whats his castle like a midden heap with a roof and a firepit jon told sam what he had seen and heard in crasters keep by the time the telling was done it was dark outside and sam was licking his fingers that was good but now id like a leg of lamb a whole leg just for me sauced with mint and honey and cloves did you see any lambs there was a sheepfold but no sheep how does he feed all his men i didnt see any men just craster and his women and a few small girls i wonder hes able to hold the place his defenses were nothing to speak of only a muddy dike you had better go up to the hall and draw that map can you find the way if i dont fall in the mud sam struggled back into his boots collected quill and parchment and shouldered out into the night the rain pattering down on his cloak and floppy hat ghost laid his head on his paws and went to sleep by the fire jon stretched out beside him grateful for the warmth he was cold and wet but not so cold and wet as hed been a short time before perhaps tonight the old bear will learn something that will lead us to uncle benjen he woke to the sight of his own breath misting in the cold morning air when he moved his bones ached ghost was gone the fire burnt out jon reached to pull aside the cloak hed hung over the rock and found it stiff and frozen he crept beneath it and stood up in a forest turned to crystal the pale pink light of dawn sparkled on branch and leaf and stone every blade of grass was carved from emerald every drip of water turned to diamond flowers and mushrooms alike wore coats of glass page even the mud puddles had a bright brown sheen through the shimmering greenery the black tents of his brothers were encased in a fine glaze of ice so there is magic beyond the wall after all he found himself thinking of his sisters perhaps because hed dreamed of them last night sansa would call this an enchantment and tears would fill her eyes at the wonder of it but arya would run out laughing and shouting wanting to touch it all lord snow he heard soft and meek he turned crouched atop the rock that had sheltered him during the night was the rabbit keeper wrapped in a black cloak so large it drowned her sams cloak jon realized at once why is she wearing sams cloak the fat one told me id find you here mlord she said we ate the rabbit if thats what you came for the admission made him feel absurdly guilty old lord crow him with the talking bird he gave craster a crossbow worth a hundred rabbits her arms closed over the swell of her belly is it true mlord are you brother to a king a half brother he admitted im ned starks bastard my brother robb is the king in the north why are you here the fat one that sam he said to see you he give me his cloak so no one would say i didnt belong wont craster be angry with you my father drank overmuch of the lord crows wine last night hell sleep most of the day her breath frosted the air in small nervous puffs they say the king gives justice and protects the weak she started to climb off the rock awkwardly but the ice had made it slippery and her foot went out from under her jon caught her before she could fall and helped her safely down the woman knelt on the icy ground mlord i beg you dont beg me anything go back to your hall you shouldnt be here we were commanded not to speak to crasters women you dont have to speak with me mlord just take me with you when you go thats all i ask all she asks he thought as if that were nothing ill ill be your wife if you like my father hes got nineteen now one less wont hurt him none black brothers are sworn never to take wives dont you know that and were guests in your fathers hall besides not you she said i watched you never ate at his board nor slept by his fire he never gave you guestright so youre not bound to him its for the baby i have to go i dont even know your name gilly he called me for the gillyflower page thats pretty he remembered sansa telling him once that he should say that whenever a lady told him her name he could not help the girl but perhaps the courtesy would please her is it craster who frightens you gilly for the baby not for me if its a girl thats not so bad shell grow a few years and hell marry her but nella says its to be a boy and shes had six and knows these things he gives the boys to the gods come the white cold he does and of late it comes more often thats why he started giving them sheep even though he has a taste for mutton only now the sheeps gone too next it will be dogs till she lowered her eyes and stroked her belly what gods jon was remembering that theyd seen no boys in crasters keep nor men either save craster himself the cold gods she said the ones in the night the white shadows and suddenly jon was back in the lord commanders tower again a severed hand was climbing his calf and when he pried it off with the point of his longsword it lay writhing fingers opening and closing the dead man rose to his feet blue eyes shining in that gashed and swollen face ropes of torn flesh hung from the great wound in his belly yet there was no blood what color are their eyes he asked her blue as bright as blue stars and as cold she has seen them he thought craster lied will you take me just so far as the wall we do not ride for the wall we ride north after mance rayder and these others these white shadows and their wights we seek them gilly your babe would not be safe with us her fear was plain on her face you will come back though when your warrings done youll pass this way again we may if any of us still live thats for the old bear to say the one you call the lord crow im only his squire i do not choose the road i ride no he could hear the defeat in her voice sorry to be of trouble mlord i only they said the king keeps people safe and i thought despairing she ran sams cloak flapping behind her like great black wings jon watched her go his joy in the mornings brittle beauty gone damn her he thought resentfully and damn sam twice for sending her to me what did he think i could do for her were here to fight wildlings not save them other men were crawling from their shelters yawning and stretching the magic was already faded icy brightness turning back to common dew in the light of the rising sun someone had gotten a fire started he could smell woodsmoke drifting through the trees and the smoky scent of bacon jon took down his cloak and snapped it against the rock shattering the thin crust of ice that had formed in the night then gathered up longclaw and shrugged an arm through a shoulder strap a few yards page away he made water into a frozen bush his piss steaming in the cold air and melting the ice wherever it fell afterward he laced up his black wool breeches and followed the smells grenn and dywen were among the brothers who had gathered round the fire hake handed jon a hollow heel of bread filled with burnt bacon and chunks of salt fish warmed in bacon grease he wolfed it down while listening to dywen boast of having three of crasters women during the night you did not grenn said scowling i would have seen dywen whapped him up alongside his ear with the back of his hand you seen youre blind as maester aemon you never even saw that bear what bear was there a bear theres always a bear declared dolorous edd in his usual tone of gloomy resignation one killed my brother when i was young afterward it wore his teeth around its neck on a leather thong and they were good teeth too better than mine ive had nothing but trouble with my teeth did sam sleep in the hall last night jon asked him id not call it sleeping the ground was hard the rushes illsmelling and my brothers snore frightfully speak of bears if you will none ever growled so fierce as brown bernarr i was warm though some dogs crawled atop me during the night my cloak was almost dry when one of them pissed in it or perhaps it was brown bernarr have you noticed that the rain stopped the instant i had a roof above me it will start again now that im back out gods and dogs alike delight to piss on me id best go see to lord mormont said jon the rain might have stopped but the compound was still a morass of shallow lakes and slippery mud black brothers were folding their tents feeding their horses and chewing on strips of salt beef jarman buckwells scouts were tightening the girths on their saddles before setting out jon buckwell greeted him from horseback keep a good edge on that bastard sword of yours well be needing it soon enough crasters hall was dim after daylight inside the nights torches had burned low and it was hard to know that the sun had risen lord mormonts raven was the first to spy him enter three lazy flaps of its great black wings and it perched atop longclaws hilt corn it nipped at a strand of jons hair ignore that wretched beggar bird jon its just had half my bacon the old bear sat at crasters board breaking his fast with the other officers on fried bread bacon and sheepgut sausage crasters new axe was on the table its gold inlay gleaming faintly in the torchlight its owner was sprawled unconscious in the sleeping loft above but the women were all up moving about and serving what sort of day do we have cold but the rain has stopped very good see that my horse is saddled and ready i mean for us to ride within the hour have you eaten craster serves plain fare but filling page i will not eat grasters food he decided suddenly i broke my fast with the men my lord jon shooed the raven off longclaw the bird hopped back to mormonts shoulder where it promptly shat you might have done that on snow instead of saving it for me the old bear grumbled the raven quorked he found sam behind the hall standing with gilly at the broken rabbit hutch she was helping him back into his cloak but when she saw jon she stole away sam gave him a look of wounded reproach i thought you would help her and how was i to do that jon said sharply take her with us wrapped up in your cloak we were commanded not to i know said sam guiltily but she was afraid i know what it is to be afraid i told her he swallowed what that wed take her with us sams fat face blushed a deep red on the way home he could not meet jons eyes shes going to have a baby sam have you taken leave of all your sense we may not even return this way and if we do do you think the old bear is going to let you pack off one of crasters wives i thought maybe by then i could think of a way i have no time for this i have horses to groom and saddle jon walked away as confused as he was angry sams heart was a big as the rest of him but for all his reading he could be as thick as grenn at times it was impossible and dishonorable besides so why do i feel so ashamed jon took his accustomed position at mormonts side as the nights watch streamed out past the skulls on crasters gate they struck off north and west along a crooked game trail melting ice dripped down all about them a slower sort of rain with its own soft music north of the compound the brook was in full spate choked with leaves and bits of wood but the scouts had found where the ford lay and the column was able to splash across the water ran as high as a horses belly ghost swam emerging on the bank with his white fur dripping brown when he shook spraying mud and water in all directions mormont said nothing but on his shoulder the raven screeched my lord jon said quietly as the wood closed in around them once more craster has no sheep nor any sons mormont made no answer at winterfell one of the serving women told us stories jon went on she used to say that there were wildlings who would lay with the others to birth halfhuman children hearth tales does craster seem less than human to you in half a hundred ways he gives his sons to the wood a long silence then yes and yes the raven muttered strutting yes yes yes you knew page smallwood told me long ago all the rangers know though few will talk of it did my uncle know all the rangers mormont repeated you think i ought to stop him kill him if need be the old bear sighed were it only that he wished to rid himself of some mouths id gladly send yoren or conwys to collect the boys we could raise them to the black and the watch would be that much the stronger but the wildlings serve crueler gods than you or i these boys are crasters offerings his prayers if you will his wives must offer different prayers jon thought how is it you came to know this the old bear asked him from one of crasters wives yes my lord jon confessed i would sooner not tell you which she was frightened and wanted help the wide world is full of people wanting help jon would that some could find the courage to help themselves craster sprawls in his loft even now stinking of wine and lost to sense on his board below lies a sharp new axe were it me id name it answered prayer and make an end yes jon thought of gilly she and her sisters they were nineteen and craster was one but yet it would be an ill day for us if craster died your uncle could tell you of the times crasters keep made the difference between life and death for our rangers my father he hesitated go on jon say what you would say my father once told me that some men are not worth having jon finished a bannerman who is brutal or unjust dishonors his liege lord as well as himself craster is his own man he has sworn us no vows nor is he subject to our laws your heart is noble jon but learn a lesson here we cannot set the world to rights that is not our purpose the nights watch has other wars to fight other wars yes i must remember jarman buckwell said i might have need of my sword soon did he mormont did not seem pleased craster said much and more last night and confirmed enough of my fears to condemn me to a sleepless night on his floor mance rayder is gathering his people together in the frostfangs thats why the villages are empty it is the same tale that ser denys mallister had from the wildling his men captured in the gorge but craster has added the where and that makes all the difference is he making a city or an army now that is the question how many wildlings are there how many men of fighting age no one knows with certainty the frostfangs are cruel inhospitable a wilderness of stone and ice they will not long sustain any great number of people i can see only one purpose in this gathering mance rayder page means to strike south into the seven kingdoms wildlings have invaded the realm before jon had heard the tales from old nan and maester luwin both back at winterfell raymun redbeard led them south in the time of my grandfathers grandfather and before him there was a king named bael the bard aye and long before them came the horned lord and the brother kings gendel and gorne and in ancient days joramun who blew the horn of winter and woke giants from the earth each man of them broke his strength on the wall or was broken by the power of winterfell on the far side but the nights watch is only a shadow of what we were and who remains to oppose the wildlings besides us the lord of winterfell is dead and his heir has marched his strength south to fight the lannisters the wildlings may never again have such a chance as this i knew mance rayder jon he is an oathbreaker yes but he has eyes to see and no man has ever dared to name him faintheart what will we do asked jon find him said mormont fight him stop him three hundred thought jon against the fury of the wild his fingers opened and closed chapter theon she was undeniably a beauty but your first is always beautiful theon greyjoy thought now theres a pretty grin a womans voice said behind him the lordling likes the look of her does he theon turned to give her an appraising glance he liked what he saw ironborn he knew at a glance lean and longlegged with black hair cut short windchafed skin strong sure hands a dirk at her belt her nose was too big and too sharp for her thin face but her smile made up for it he judged her a few years older than he was but no more than fiveandtwenty she moved as if she were used to a deck beneath her feet yes shes a sweet sight he told her though not half so sweet as you oho she grinned id best be careful this lordling has a honeyed tongue taste it and see is it that way then she said eyeing him boldly there were women on the iron islandsnot many but a fewwho crewed the longships along with their men and it was said that salt and sea changed them gave them a mans appetites have you been that long at sea lordling or were there no women where you came from women enough but none like you page and how would you know what im like my eyes can see your face my ears can hear your laughter and my cocks gone hard as a mast for you the woman stepped close and pressed a hand to the front of his breeches well youre no liar she said giving him a squeeze through the cloth how bad does it hurt fiercely poor lordling she released him and stepped back as it happens im a woman wed and new with child the gods are good theon said no chance id give you a bastard that way even so my man wouldnt thank you no but you might and why would that be ive had lords before theyre made the same as other men have you ever had a prince he asked her when youre wrinkled and grey and your teats hang past your belly you can tell your childrens children that once you loved a king oh is it love were talking now and here i thought it was just cocks and cunts is it love you fancy hed decided that he liked this wench whoever she was her sharp wit was a welcome respite from the damp gloom of pyke shall i name my longship after you and play you the high harp and keep you in a tower room in my castle with only jewels to wear like a princess in a song you ought to name your ship after me she said ignoring all the rest it was me who built her sigrin built her my lord fathers shipwright im esgred ambrodes daughter and wife to sigrin he had not known that ambrode had a daughter or sigrin a wife but hed met the younger shipwright only once and the older one he scarce remembered youre wasted on sigrin oho sigrin told me this sweet ship is wasted on you theon bristled do you know who i am prince theon of house greyjoy who else tell me true my lord how well do you love her this new maid of yours sigrin will want to know the longship was so new that she still smelled of pitch and resin his uncle aeron would bless her on the morrow but theon had ridden over from pyke to get a look at her before she was launched she was not so large as lord balons own great kraken or his uncle victarions iron victory but she looked swift and sweet even sitting in her wooden cradle on the strand lean black hull a hundred feet long a page single tall mast fifty long oars deck enough for a hundred men and at the prow the great iron ram in the shape of an arrowhead sigrin did me good service he admitted is she as fast as she looks fasterfor a master that knows how to handle her it has been a few years since i sailed a ship and ive never captained one if truth be told still im a greyjoy and an ironman the sea is in my blood and your blood will be in the sea if you sail the way you talk she told him i would never mistreat such a fair maiden fair maiden she laughed shes a sea bitch this one there and now youve named her sea bitch that amused her he could see the sparkle in her dark eyes and you said youd name her after me she said in a voice of wounded reproach i did he caught her hand help me my lady in the green lands they believe a woman with child means good fortune for any man who beds her and what would they know about ships in the green lands or women for that matter besides i think you made that up if i confess will you still love me still when have i ever loved you never he admitted but i am trying to repair that lack my sweet esgred the wind is cold come aboard my ship and let me warm you on the morrow my uncle aeron will pour seawater over her prow and mumble a prayer to the drowned god but id sooner bless her with the milk of my loins and yours the drowned god might not take that kindly bugger the drowned god if he troubles us ill drown him again were off to war within a fortnight would you send me into battle all sleepless with longing gladly a cruel maid my ship is well named if i steer her onto the rocks in my distraction youll have yourself to blame do you plan to steer with this esgred brushed the front of his breeches once more and smiled as a finger traced the iron outline of his manhood come back to pyke with me he said suddenly thinking what will lord balon say and why should i care i am a man grown if i want to bring a wench to bed it is no ones business but my own page and what would i do in pyke her hand stayed where it was my father will feast his captains tonight he had them to feast every night while he waited for the last stragglers to arrive but theon saw no need to tell all that would you make me your captain for the night my lord prince she had the wickedest smile hed ever seen on a woman i might if i knew youd steer me safe into port well i know which end of the oar goes in the sea and theres no one better with ropes and knots onehanded she undid the lacing of his breeches then grinned and stepped lightly away from him a pity im a woman wed and new with child flustered theon laced himself back up i need to start back to the castle if you do not come with me i may lose my way for grief and all the islands would be poorer we couldnt have that but i have no horse my lord you could take my squires mount and leave your poor squire to walk all the way to pyke share mine then youd like that well enough the smile again now would i be behind you or in front you would be wherever you liked i like to be on top where has this wench been all my life my fathers hall is dim and dank it needs esgred to make the fires blaze the lordling has a honeyed tongue isnt that where we began she threw up her hands and where we end esgred is yours sweet prince take me to your castle let me see your proud towers rising from the sea i left my horse at the inn come they walked down the strand together and when theon took her arm she did not pull away he liked the way she walked there was a boldness to it part saunter and part sway that suggested she would be just as bold beneath the blankets lordsport was as crowded as hed ever seen it swarming with the crews of the longships that lined the pebbled shore and rode at anchor well out past the breakwater ironmen did not bend their knees often nor easily but theon noted that oarsmen and townfolk alike grew quiet as they passed and acknowledged him with respectful bows of the head they have finally learned who i am he thought and past time too page lord goodbrother of great wyk had come in the night before with his main strength near forty longships his men were everywhere conspicuous in their striped goats hair sashes it was said about the inn that otter gimpknees whores were being fucked bowlegged by beardless boys in sashes the boys were welcome to them so far as theon was concerned a poxier den of slatterns he hoped hed never see his present companion was more to his taste that she was wed to his fathers shipwright and pregnant to boot only made her more intriguing has my lord prince begun choosing his crew esgred asked as they made their way toward the stable ho bluetooth she shouted to a passing seafarer a tall man in bearskin vest and ravenwinged helm how fares your bride fat with child and talking of twins so soon esgred smiled that wicked smile you got your oar in the water quickly aye and stroked and stroked and stroked roared the man a big man theon observed bluetooth was it should i choose him for my sea bitch only if you mean to insult him bluetooth has a sweet ship of his own i have been too long away to know one man from another theon admitted hed looked for a few of the friends hed played with as a boy but they were gone dead or grown into strangers my uncle victarion has loaned me his own steersman rymolf stormdrunk a good man so long as hes sober she saw more faces she knew and called out to a passing trio uller qarl wheres your brother skyte the drowned god needed a strong oarsman i fear replied the stocky man with the white streak in his beard what he means is eldiss drank too much wine and his fat belly burst said the pinkcheeked youth beside him whats dead may never die esgred said whats dead may never die theon muttered the words with them you seem well known he said to the woman when the men had passed on every man loves the shipwrights wife he had better lest he wants his ship to sink if you need men to pull your oars you could do worse than those three lordsport has no lack of strong arms theon had given the matter no little thought it was fighters he wanted and men who would be loyal to him not to his lord father or his uncles he was playing the part of a dutiful young prince for the moment while he waited for lord balon to reveal the fullness of his plans if it turned out that he did not like those plans or his part in them however well strength is not enough a longships oars must move as one if you would have her best speed choose men who have rowed together before if youre wise page sage counsel perhaps youd help me choose them let her believe i want her wisdom women fancy that i may if you treat me kindly how else theon quickened his stride as they neared the myraham rocking high and empty by the quay her captain had tried to sail a fortnight past but lord balon would not permit it none of the merchantmen that called at lordsport had been allowed to depart again his father wanted no word of the hosting to reach the mainland before he was ready to strike milord a plaintive voice called down from the forecastle of the merchanter the captains daughter leaned over the rail gazing after him her father had forbidden her to come ashore but whenever theon came to lordsport he spied her wandering forlornly about the deck milord a moment she called after him as it please milord did she esgred asked as theon hurried her past the cog please milord he saw no sense in being coy with this one for a time now she wants to be my salt wife oho well shed profit from some salting no doubt too soft and bland that one or am i wrong youre not wrong soft and bland precisely how had she known he had told wex to wait at the inn the common room was so crowded that theon had to push his way through the door not a seat was to be had at bench nor table nor did he see his squire wex he shouted over the din and clatter if hes up with one of those poxy whores ill strip the hide off him he was thinking when he finally spied the boy dicing near the hearth and winning too by the look of the pile of coins before him time to go theon announced when the boy paid him no mind he seized him by the ear and pulled him from the game wex grabbed up a fistful of coppers and came along without a word that was one of the things theon liked best about him most squires have loose tongues but wex had been born dumb which didnt seem to keep him from being clever as any twelveyearold had a right to be he was a baseborn son of one of lord botleys half brothers taking him as squire had been part of the price theon had paid for his horse when wex saw esgred his eyes went round youd think hed never seen a woman before theon thought esgred will be riding with me back to pyke saddle the horses and be quick about it the boy had ridden in on a scrawny little garron from lord balons stable but theons mount was quite another sort of beast where did you find that hellhorse esgred asked when she saw him but from the way she laughed he knew she was impressed lord botley bought him in lannisport a year past but he proved to be too much horse for him so botley was pleased to sell the iron islands were too sparse and rocky for breeding good horses most of the islanders were indifferent riders at best more comfortable on the deck of a longship than in the saddle even the lords rode garrons or shaggy harlaw ponies and ox carts were more page common than drays the smallfolk too poor to own either one pulled their own plows through the thin stony soil but theon had spent ten years in winterfell and did not intend to go to war without a good mount beneath him lord botleys misjudgment was his good fortune a stallion with a temper as black as his hide larger than a courser if not quite so big as most destriers as theon was not quite so big as most knights that suited him admirably the animal had fire in his eyes when hed met his new owner hed pulled back his lips and tried to bite off his face does he have a name esgred asked theon as he mounted smiler he gave her a hand and pulled her up in front of him where he could put his arms around her as they rode i knew a man once who told me that i smiled at the wrong things do you only by the lights of those who smile at nothing he thought of his father and his uncle aeron are you smiling now my lord prince oh yes theon reached around her to take the reins she was almost of a height with him her hair could have used a wash and she had a faded pink scar on her pretty neck but he liked the smell of her salt and sweat and woman the ride back to pyke promised to be a good deal more interesting than the ride down had been when they were well beyond lordsport theon put a hand on her breast esgred reached up and plucked it away id keep both hands on the reins or this black beast of yours is like to fling us both off and kick us to death i broke him of that amused theon behaved himself for a while chatting amiably of the weather grey and overcast as it had been since he arrived with frequent rains and telling her of the men hed killed in the whispering wood when he reached the part about coming that close to the kingslayer himself he slid his hand back up to where it had been her breasts were small but he liked the firmness of them you dont want to do that my lord prince oh but i do theon gave her a squeeze your squire is watching you let him hell never speak of it i swear esgred pried his fingers off her breast this time she kept him firmly prisoned she had strong hands i like a woman with a good tight grip she snorted id not have thought it by that wench on the waterfront you must not judge me by her she was the only woman on the ship page tell me of your father will he welcome me kindly to his castle why should he he scarcely welcomed me his own blood the heir to pyke and the iron islands are you she asked mildly its said that you have uncles brothers a sister my brothers are long dead and my sister well they say ashas favorite gown is a chainmail hauberk that hangs down past her knees with boiled leather smallclothes beneath mens garb wont make her a man though ill make a good marriage alliance with her once weve won the war if i can find a man to take her as i recall she had a nose like a vultures beak a ripe crop of pimples and no more chest than a boy you can marry off your sister esgred observed but not your uncles my uncles theons claim took precedence over those of his fathers three brothers but the woman had touched on a sore point nonetheless in the islands it was scarce unheard of for a strong ambitious uncle to dispossess a weak nephew of his rights and usually murder him in the bargain but i am not weak theon told himself and i mean to be stronger yet by the time my father dies my uncles pose no threat to me he declared aeron is drunk on seawater and sanctity he lives only for his god his god not yours mine as well what is dead can never die he smiled thinly if i make pious noises as required damphair will give me no trouble and my uncle victarion lord captain of the iron fleet and a fearsome warrior i have heard them sing of him in the alehouses during my lord fathers rebellion he sailed into lannisport with my uncle euron and burned the larmister fleet where it lay at anchor theon recalled the plan was eurons though victarion is like some great grey bullock strong and tireless and dutiful but not like to win any races no doubt hell serve me as loyally as he has served my lord father he has neither the wits nor the ambition to plot betrayal euron croweye has no lack of cunning though ive heard men say terrible things of that one theon shifted his seat my uncle euron has not been seen in the islands for close on two years he may be dead if so it might be for the best lord balons eldest brother had never given up the old way even for a day his silence with its black sails and dark red hull was infamous in every port from ibben to asshai it was said he may be dead esgred agreed and if he lives why he has spent so long at sea hed be half a stranger here the ironborn would never seat a stranger in the seastone chair i suppose not theon replied before it occurred to him that some would call him a stranger as well the thought made him frown ten years is a long while but i am back now and my father is far from dead i have time to prove myself he considered fondling esgreds breast again but she would probably only take his hand away and all this talk of his uncles had dampened his ardor somewhat time enough for such play at the castle in the page privacy of his chambers i will speak to helya when we reach pyke and see that you have an honored place at the feast he said i must sit on the dais at my fathers right hand but i will come down and join you when he leaves the hall he seldom lingers long he has no belly for drink these days a grievous thing when a great man grows old lord balon is but the father of a great man a modest lordling only a fool humbles himself when the world is so full of men eager to do that job for him he kissed her lightly on the nape of her neck what shall i wear to this great feast she reached back and pushed his face away ill ask helya to garb you one of my lady mothers gowns might do she is off on harlaw and not expected to return the cold winds have worn her away i hear will you not go see her harlaw is only a days sail and surely lady greyjoy yearns for a last sight of her son would that i could i am kept too busy here my father relies on me now that i am returned come peace perhaps your coming might bring her peace now you sound a woman theon complained i confess i am and new with child somehow that thought excited him so you say but your body shows no signs of it how shall it be proven before i believe you i shall need to see your breasts grow ripe and taste your mothers milk and what will my husband say to this your fathers own sworn man and servant well give him so many ships to build hell never know youve left him she laughed its a cruel lordling whos seized me if i promise you that one day you may watch my babe get suck will you tell me more of your war theon of house greyjoy there are miles and mountains still ahead of us and i would hear of this wolf king you served and the golden lions he fights ever anxious to please her theon obliged the rest of the long ride passed swiftly as he filled her pretty head with tales of winterfell and war some of the things he said astonished him she is easy to talk to gods praise her he reflected i feel as though ive known her for years if the wenchs pillow play is half the equal of her wit ill need to keep her he thought of sigrin the shipwright a thickbodied thickwitted man flaxen hair already receding from a pimpled brow and shook his head a waste a most tragic waste it seemed scarcely any time at all before the great curtain wall of pyke loomed up before them page the gates were open theon put his heels into smiler and rode through at a brisk trot the hounds were barking wildly as he helped esgred dismount several came bounding up tails wagging they shot straight past him and almost bowled the woman over leaping all around her yapping and licking off theon shouted aiming an ineffectual kick at one big brown bitch but esgred was laughing and wrestling with them a stableman came pounding up after the dogs take the horse theon commanded him and get these damn dogs away the lout paid him no mind his face broke into a huge gaptoothed smile and he said lady asha youre back last night she said i sailed from great wyk with lord goodbrother and spent the night at the inn my little brother was kind enough to let me ride with him from lordsport she kissed one of the dogs on the nose and grinned at theon all he could do was stand and gape at her asha no she cannot be asha he realized suddenly that there were two ashas in his head one was the little girl he had known the other more vaguely imagined looked something like her mother neither looked a bit like this this this the pimples went when the breasts came she explained while she tussled with a dog but i kept the vultures beak theon found his voice why didnt you tell me asha let go of the hound and straightened i wanted to see who you were first and i did she gave him a mocking half bow and now little brother pray excuse me i need to bathe and dress for the feast i wonder if i still have that chainmail gown i like to wear over my boiled leather smallclothes she gave him that evil grin and crossed the bridge with that walk hed liked so well half saunter and half sway when theon turned away wex was smirking at him he gave the boy a clout on the ear thats for enjoying this so much and another harder and thats for not warning me next time grow a tongue his own chambers in the guest keep had never seemed so chilly though the thralls had left a brazier burning theon kicked his boots off let his cloak fall to the floor and poured himself a cup of wine remembering a gawky girl with knob knees and pimples she unlaced my breeches he thought outraged and she said oh gods and i said he groaned he could not possibly have made a more appalling fool of himself no he thought then she was the one who made me a fool the evil bitch must have enjoyed every moment of it and the way she kept reaching for my cock he took his cup and went to the window seat where he sat drinking and watching the sea while the sun darkened over pyke i have no place here he thought and asha is the reason may the others take her the water below turned from green to grey to black by then he could hear distant music and he knew it was time to change for the feast page theon chose plain boots and plainer clothes somber shades of black and grey to fit his mood no ornament he had nothing bought with iron i might have taken something off that wildling i killed to save bran stark but he had nothing worth the taking thats my cursed luck i kill the poor the long smoky hall was crowded with his fathers lords and captains when theon entered near four hundred of them dagmer cleftjaw had not yet returned from old wyk with the stonehouses and drumms but all the rest were thereharlaws from harlaw blacktydes from blacktyde sparrs merlyns and goodbrothers from great wyk saltcliffes and sunderlies from saltcliffe and botleys and wynches from the other side of pyke the thralls were pouring ale and there was music fiddles and skins and drums three burly men were doing the finger dance spinning shorthafted axes at each other the trick was to catch the axe or leap over it without missing a step it was called the finger dance because it usually ended when one of the dancers lost one or two or five neither the dancers nor the drinkers took much note of theon greyjoy as he strode to the dais lord balon occupied the seastone chair carved in the shape of a great kraken from an immense block of oily black stone legend said that the first men had found it standing on the shore of old wyk when they came to the iron islands to the left of the high seat were theons uncles asha was ensconced at his right hand in the place of honor you come late theon lord balon observed i ask your pardon theon took the empty seat beside asha leaning close he hissed in her ear youre in my place she turned to him with innocent eyes brother surely you are mistaken your place is at winterfell her smile cut and where are all your pretty clothes i heard you fancied silk and velvet against your skin she was in soft green wool herself simply cut the fabric clinging to the slender lines of her body your hauberk must have rusted away sister he threw back a great pity id like to see you all in iron asha only laughed you may yet little brother if you think your sea bitch can keep up with my black wind one of their fathers thralls came near bearing a flagon of wine are you drinking ale or wine tonight theon she leaned over close or is it still a taste of my mothers milk you thirst for he flushed wine he told the thrall asha turned away and banged on the table shouting for ale theon hacked a loaf of bread in half hollowed out a trencher and summoned a cook to fill it with fish stew the smell of the thick cream made him a little ill but he forced himself to eat some hed drunk enough wine to float him through two meals if i retch it will be on her does father know that youve married his shipwright he asked his sister no more than sigrin does she gave a shrug esgred was the first ship he built he named her after his mother i would be hardpressed to say which he loves best every word you spoke to me was a lie not every word remember when i told you i like to be on top asha grinned that only made him angrier all that about being a woman wed and new with child oh that part was true enough asha leapt to her feet rolfe here she shouted down at one of the finger dancers holding up a hand he saw her spun and suddenly an axe came flying from his hand the page blade gleaming as it tumbled end over end through the torchlight theon had time for a choked gasp before asha snatched the axe from the air and slammed it down into the table splitting his trencher in two and splattering his mantle with drippings theres my lord husband his sister reached down inside her gown and drew a dirk from between her breasts and heres my sweet suckling babe he could not imagine how he looked at that moment but suddenly theon greyjoy realized that the great hall was ringing with laughter all of it at him even his father was smiling gods be damned and his uncle victarion chuckled aloud the best response he could summon was a queasy grin we shall see who is laughing when all this is done bitch asha wrenched the axe out of the table and flung it back down at the dancers to whistles and loud cheers youd do well to heed what i told you about choosing a crew a thrall offered them a platter and she stabbed a salted fish and ate it off the end of her dirk if you had troubled to learn the first thing of sigrin i could never have fooled you ten years a wolf and you land here and think to prince about the islands but you know nothing and no one why should men fight and die for you i am their lawful prince theon said stiffly by the laws of the green lands you might be but we make our own laws here or have you forgotten scowling theon turned to contemplate the leaking trencher before him he would have stew in his lap before long he shouted for a thrall to clean it up half my life i have waited to come home and for what mockery and disregard this was not the pyke he remembered or did he remember he had been so young when they took him away to hold hostage the feast was a meager enough thing a succession of fish stews black bread and spiceless goat the tastiest thing theon found to eat was an onion pie ale and wine continued to flow well after the last of the courses had been cleared away lord balon greyjoy rose from the seastone chair have done with your drink and come to my solar he commanded his companions on the dais we have plans to lay he left them with no other word flanked by two of his guards his brothers followed in short order theon rose to go after them my little brother is in a rush to be off asha raised her drinking horn and beckoned for more ale our lord father is waiting and has for many a year it will do him no harm to wait a little longer but if you fear his wrath scurry after him by all means you ought to have no trouble catching our uncles she smiled one is drunk on seawater after all and the other is a great grey bullock so dim hell probably get lost theon sat back down annoyed i run after no man no man but every woman it was not me who grabbed your cock i dont have one remember you grabbed every other bit of me quick enough page he could feel the flush creeping up his cheeks im a man with a mans hungers what sort of unnatural creature are you only a shy maid ashas hand darted out under the table to give his cock a squeeze theon nearly jumped from his chair what dont you want me to steer you into port brother marriage is not for you theon decided when i rule i believe i will pack you off to the silent sisters he lurched to his feet and strode off unsteadily to find his father rain was falling by the time he reached the swaying bridge out to the sea tower his stomach was crashing and churning like the waves below and wine had unsteadied his feet theon gritted his teeth and gripped the rope tightly as he made his way across pretending that it was ashas neck he was clutching the solar was as damp and drafty as ever buried under his sealskin robes his father sat before the brazier with his brothers on either side of him victarion was talking of tides and winds when theon entered but lord balon waved him silent i have made my plans it is time you heard them i have some suggestions when i require your counsel i shall ask for it his father said we have had a bird from old wyk dagmer is bringing the drumms and stonehouses if the god grants us good winds we will sail when they arrive or you will i mean for you to strike the first blow theon you shall take eight longships north eight his face reddened what can i hope to accomplish with only eight longships you are to harry the stony shore raiding the fishing villages and sinking any ships you chance to meet it may be that you will draw some of the northern lords out from behind their stone walls aeron will accompany you and dagmer cleftjaw may the drowned god bless our swords the priest said theon felt as if hed been slapped he was being sent to do reavers work burning fishermen out of their hovels and raping their ugly daughters and yet it seemed lord balon did not trust him sufficiently to do even that much bad enough to have to suffer the damphairs scowls and chidings with dagmer cleftjaw along as well his command would be purely nominal asha my daughter lord balon went on and theon turned to see that his sister had slipped in silently you shall take thirty longships of picked men round sea dragon point land upon the tidal flats north of deepwood motte march quickly and the castle may fall before they even know you are upon them asha smiled like a cat in cream ive always wanted a castle she said sweetly then take one theon had to bite his tongue deepwood motte was the stronghold of the glovers with both robett and galbart warring in the south it would be lightly held and once the castle fell the ironmen would have a secure base in the heart of the north i should be the one sent to take deepwood he knew deepwood motte he had visited the glovers several times with eddard stark page victarion lord balon said to his brother the main thrust shall fall to you when my sons have struck their blows winterfell must respond you should meet small opposition as you sail up saltspear and the fever river at the headwaters you will be less than twenty miles from moat cailin the neck is the key to the kingdom already we command the western seas once we hold moat cailin the pup will not be able to win back to the north and if he is fool enough to try his enemies will seal the south end of the causeway behind him and robb the boy will find himself caught like a rat in a bottle theon could keep silent no longer a bold plan father but the lords in their castles lord balon rode over him the lords are gone south with the pup those who remained behind are the cravens old men and green boys they will yield or fall one by one winterfell may defy us for a year but what of it the rest shall be ours forest and field and hall and we shall make the folk our thralls and salt wives aeron damphair raised his arms and the waters of wrath will rise high and the drowned god will spread his dominion across the green lands what is dead can never die victarion intoned lord balon and asha echoed his words and theon had no choice but to mumble along with them and then it was done outside the rain was falling harder than ever the rope bridge twisted and writhed under his feet theon greyjoy stopped in the center of the span and contemplated the rocks below the sound of the waves was a crashing roar and he could taste the salt spray on his lips a sudden gust of wind made him lose his footing and he stumbled to his knees asha helped him rise you cant hold your wine either brother theon leaned on her shoulder and let her guide him across the rainslick boards i liked you better when you were esgred he told her accusingly she laughed thats fair i liked you better when you were nine chapter tyrion through the door came the soft sound of the high harp mingled with a trilling of pipes the singers voice was muffled by the thick walls yet tyrion knew the verse i loved a maid as fair as summer he remembered with sunlight in her hair ser meryn trant guarded the queens door this night his muttered my lord struck tyrion as a tad grudging but he opened the door nonetheless the song broke off abruptly as he strode into his sisters bedchamber cersei was reclining on a pile of cushions her feet were bare her golden hair artfully tousled her robe a greenandgold samite that caught the light of the candles and shimmered as she looked up sweet sister page tyrion said how beautiful you look tonight he turned to the singer and you as well cousin i had no notion you had such a lovely voice the compliment made ser lancel sulky perhaps he thought he was being mocked it seemed to tyrion that the lad had grown three inches since being knighted lancel had thick sandy hair green lannister eyes and a line of soft blond fuzz on his upper lip at sixteen he was cursed with all the certainty of youth unleavened by any trace of humor or selfdoubt and wed to the arrogance that came so naturally to those born blond and strong and handsome his recent elevation had only made him worse did her grace send for you the boy demanded not that i recall tyrion admitted it grieves me to disturb your revels lancel but as it happens i have matters of import to discuss with my sister cersei regarded him suspiciously if you are here about those begging brothers tyrion spare me your reproaches i wont have them spreading their filthy treasons in the streets they can preach to each other in the dungeons and count themselves lucky that they have such a gentle queen added lancel i would have had their tongues out one even dared to say that the gods were punishing us because jaime murdered the rightful king cersei declared it will not be borne tyrion i gave you ample opportunity to deal with these lice but you and your ser jacelyn did nothing so i commanded vylarr to attend to the matter and so he did tyrion had been annoyed when the red cloaks had dragged a half dozen of the scabrous prophets down to the dungeons without consulting him but they were not important enough to battle over no doubt we will all be better off for a little quiet in the streets that is not why i came i have tidings i know you will be anxious to hear sweet sister but they are best spoken of privily very well the harpist and the piper bowed and hurried out while cersei kissed her cousin chastely on the cheek leave us lancel my brothers harmless when hes alone if hed brought his pets wed smell them the young knight gave his cousin a baleful glance and pulled the door shut forcefully behind him ill have you know i make shagga bathe once a fortnight tyrion said when he was gone youre very pleased with yourself arent you why why not tyrion said every day every night hammers rang along the street of steel and the great chain grew longer he hopped up onto the great canopied bed is this the bed where robert died im surprised you kept it it gives me sweet dreams she said now spit out your business and waddle away imp tyrion smiled lord stannis has sailed from dragonstone cersei bolted to her feet and yet you sit there grinning like a harvestday pumpkin has bywater called out the city watch we must send a bird to harrenhal at once he was laughing by then she seized him by the shoulders and shook him stop it are you mad or drunk stop it page it was all he could do to get out the words i cant he gasped its too gods too funny stannis what he hasnt sailed against us tyrion managed hes laid siege to storms end renly is riding to meet him his sisters nails dug painfully into his arms for a moment she stared incredulous as if he had begun to gibber in an unknown tongue stannis and renly are fighting each other when he nodded cersei began to chuckle gods be good she gasped im starting to believe that robert was the clever one tyrion threw back his head and roared they laughed together cersei pulled him off the bed and whirled him around and even hugged him for a moment as giddy as a girl by the time she let go of him tyrion was breathless and dizzy he staggered to her sideboard and put out a hand to steady himself do you think it will truly come to battle between them if they should come to some accord they wont tyrion said they are too different and yet too much alike and neither could ever stomach the other and stannis has always felt he was cheated of storms end cersei said thoughtfully the ancestral seat of house baratheon his by rights if you knew how many times he came to robert singing that same dull song in that gloomy aggrieved tone he has when robert gave the place to renly stannis clenched his jaw so tight i thought his teeth would shatter he took it as a slight it was meant as a slight cersei said shall we raise a cup to brotherly love yes she answered breathless oh gods yes his back was to her as he filled two cups with sweet arbor red it was the easiest thing in the world to sprinkle a pinch of fine powder into hers to stannis he said as he handed her the wine harmless when im alone am i to renly she replied laughing may they battle long and hard and the others take them both is this the cersei that jaime sees when she smiled you saw how beautiful she was truly i loved a maid as fair as summer with sunlight in her hair he almost felt sorry for poisoning her it was the next morning as he broke his fast that her messenger arrived the queen was indisposed and would not be able to leave her chambers not able to leave her privy more like tyrion made the proper sympathetic noises and sent word to cersei to rest easy he would treat with ser cleos as theyd planned the iron throne of aegon the conqueror was a tangle of nasty barbs and jagged metal teeth waiting for any fool who tried to sit too comfortably and the steps made his stunted legs cramp as he climbed up to it all too aware of what an absurd page spectacle he must be yet there was one thing to be said for it it was high lannister guardsmen stood silent in their crimson cloaks and lioncrested halffielms ser jacelyns gold cloaks faced them across the hall the steps to the throne were flanked by bronn and ser preston of the kingsguard courtiers filled the gallery while supplicants clustered near the towering oakandbronze doors sansa stark looked especially lovely this morning though her face was as pale as milk lord gyles stood coughing while poor cousin tyrek wore his bridegrooms mantle of miniver and velvet since his marriage to little lady ermesande three days past the other squires had taken to calling him wet nurse and asking him what sort of swaddling clothes his bride wore on their wedding night tyrion looked down on them all and found he liked it call forth ser cleos frey his voice rang off the stone walls and down the length of the hall he liked that too a pity shae could not be here to see this he reflected shed asked to come but it was impossible ser cleos made the long walk between the gold cloaks and the crimson looking neither right nor left as he knelt tyrion observed that his cousin was losing his hair ser cleos littlefinger said from the council table you have our thanks for bringing us this peace offer from lord stark grand maester pycelle cleared his throat the queen regent the kings hand and the small council have considered the terms offered by this selfstyled king in the north sad to say they will not do and you must tell these northmen so ser here are our terms said tyrion robb stark must lay down his sword swear fealty and return to winterfell he must free my brother unharmed and place his host under jaimes command to march against the rebels renly and stannis baratheon each of starks bannermen must send us a son as hostage a daughter will suffice where there is no son they shall be treated gently and given high places here at court so long as their fathers commit no new treasons cleos frey looked ill my lord hand he said lord stark will never consent to these terms we never expected he would cleos tell him that we have raised another great host at casterly rock that soon it will march on him from the west while my lord father advances from the east tell him that he stands alone without hope of allies stannis and renly baratheon war against each other and the prince of dorne has consented to wed his son trystane to the princess myrcella murmurs of delight and consternation alike arose from the gallery and the back of the hall as to this of my cousins tyrion went on we offer harrion karstark and ser wylis manderly for willem lannister and lord cerwyn and ser donnel locke for your brother tion tell stark that two lannisters are worth four northmen in any season he waited for the laughter to die his fathers bones he shall have as a gesture of joffreys good faith lord stark asked for his sisters and his fathers sword as well ser cleos reminded him ser ilyn payne stood mute the hilt of eddard starks greatsword rising over one shoulder ice said tyrion hell have that when he makes his peace with us not before as you say and his sisters tyrion glanced toward sansa and felt a stab of pity as he said until such time as he frees my brother page jaime unharmed they shall remain here as hostages how well they are treated depends on him and if the gods are good bywater will find arya alive before robb learns shes gone missing i shall bring him your message my lord tyrion plucked at one of the twisted blades that sprang from the arm of the throne and now the thrust vylarr he called my lord the men stark sent are sufficient to protect lord eddards bones but a lannister should have a lannister escort tyrion declared ser cleos is the queens cousin and mine we shall sleep more easily if you would see him safely back to riverrun as you command how many men should i take why all of them vylarr stood like a man made of stone it was grand maester pycelle who rose gasping my lord hand that cannot your father lord tywin himself he sent these good men to our city to protect queen cersei and her children the kingsguard and the city watch protect them well enough the gods speed you on your way vylarr at the council table varys smiled knowingly littlefinger sat feigning boredom and pycelle gaped like a fish pale and confused a herald stepped forward if any man has other matters to set before the kings hand let him speak now or go forth and hold his silence i will be heard a slender man all in black pushed his way between the redwyne twins ser alliser tyrion exclaimed why i had no notion that youd come to court you should have sent me word i have as well you know thorne was as prickly as his name a spare sharpfeatured man of fifty hardeyed and hardhanded his black hair streaked with grey i have been shunned ignored and left to wait like some baseborn servant truly bronn this was not well done ser alliser and i are old friends we walked the wall together sweet ser alliser murmured varys you must not think too harshly of us so many seek our joffreys grace in these troubled and tumultuous times more troubled than you know eunuch to his face we call him lord eunuch quipped littlefinger how may we be of help to you good brother grand maester pycelle asked in soothing tones the lord commander sent me to his grace the king thorne answered the matter is too grave to page be left to servants the king is playing with his new crossbow tyrion said ridding himself of joffrey had required only an ungainly myrish crossbow that threw three quarrels at a time and nothing would do but that he try it at once you can speak to servants or hold your silence as you will ser alliser said displeasure in every word i am sent to tell you that we found two rangers long missing they were dead yet when we brought the corpses back to the wall they rose again in the night one slew ser jaremy rykker while the second tried to murder the lord commander distantly tyrion heard someone snigger does he mean to mock me with this folly he shifted uneasily and glanced down at varys littlefinger and pycelle wondering if one of them had a role in this a dwarf enjoyed at best a tenuous hold on dignity once the court and kingdom started to laugh at him he was doomed and yet and yet tyrion remembered a cold night under the stars when hed stood beside the boy jon snow and a great white wolf atop the wall at the end of the world gazing out at the trackless dark beyond he had feltwhatsomething to be sure a dread that had cut like that frigid northern wind a wolf had howled off in the night and the sound had sent a shiver through him dont be a fool he told himself a wolf a wind a dark forest it meant nothing and yet he had come to have a liking for old jeor mormont during his time at castle black i trust that the old bear survived this attack he did and that your brothers killed these ah dead men we did youre certain that they are dead this time tyrion asked mildly when brorm choked on a snort of laughter he knew how he must proceed truly truly dead they were dead the first time ser alliser snapped pale and cold with black hands and feet i brought jareds hand torn from his corpse by the bastards wolf littlefinger stirred and where is this charming token ser alliser frowned uncomfortably it rotted to pieces while i waited unheard theres naught left to show but bones titters echoed through the hall lord baelish tyrion called down to littlefinger buy our brave ser alliser a hundred spades to take back to the wall with him spades ser alliser narrowed his eyes suspiciously if you bury your dead they wont come walking tyrion told him and the court laughed openly spades will end your troubles with some strong backs to wield them ser jacelyn see that the good brother has his pick of the city dungeons ser jacelyn bywater said as you will my lord but the cells are near empty yoren took all the likely page men arrest some more then tyrion told him or spread the word that theres bread and turnips on the wall and theyll go of their own accord the city had too many mouths to feed and the nights watch a perpetual need of men at tyrions signal the herald cried an end and the hall began to empty ser alliser thorne was not so easily dismissed he was waiting at the foot of the iron throne when tyrion descended do you think i sailed all the way from eastwatchbythesea to be mocked by the likes of you he fumed blocking the way this is no jape i saw it with my own eyes i tell you the dead walk you should try to kill them more thoroughly tyrion pushed past ser alliser made to grab his sleeve but preston greenfield thrust him back no closer ser thorne knew better than to challenge a knight of the kingsguard you are a fool imp he shouted at tyrions back the dwarf turned to face him me truly then why were they laughing at you i wonder he smiled wanly you came for men did you not the cold winds are rising the wall must be held and to hold it you need men which ive given you as you might have noted if your ears heard anything but insults take them thank me and begone before im forced to take a crab fork to you again give my warm regards to lord mormont and to jon snow as well brorm seized ser alliser by the elbow and marched him forcefully from the hall grand maester pycelle had already scuttled off but varys and littlefinger had watched it all start to finish i grow ever more admiring of you my lord confessed the eunuch you appease the stark boy with his fathers bones and strip your sister of her protectors in one swift stroke you give that black brother the men he seeks rid the city of some hungry mouths yet make it all seem mockery so none may say that the dwarf fears snarks and grumkins oh deftly done littlefinger stroked his beard do you truly mean to send away all your guards lannister no i mean to send away all my sisters guards the queen will never allow that oh i think she may i am her brother and when youve known me longer youll learn that i mean everything i say even the lies especially the lies lord petyr i sense that you are unhappy with me i love you as much as i ever have my lord though i do not relish being played for a fool if myrcella weds trystane martell she can scarcely wed robert arryn can she page not without causing a great scandal he admitted i regret my little ruse lord petyr but when we spoke i could not know the dornishmen would accept my offer littlefinger was not appeased i do not like being lied to my lord leave me out of your next deception only if youll do the same for me tyrion thought glancing at the dagger sheathed at littlefingers hip if i have given offense i am deeply sorry all men know how much we love you my lord and how much we need you try and remember that with that littlefinger left them walk with me varys said tyrion they left through the kings door behind the throne the eunuchs slippers whisking lightly over the stone lord baelish has the truth of it you know the queen will never permit you to send away her guard she will youll see to that a smile flickered across varyss plump lips will i oh for a certainty youll tell her it is part of my scheme to free jaime varys stroked a powdered cheek this would doubtless involve the four men your man bronn searched for so diligently in all the low places of kings landing a thief a poisoner a mummer and a murderer put them in crimson cloaks and lion helms theyll look no different from any other guardsmen i searched for some time for a ruse that might get them into riverrun before i thought to hide them in plain sight theyll ride in by the main gate flying lannister banners and escorting lord eddards bones he smiled crookedly four men alone would be watched vigilantly four among a hundred can lose themselves so i must send the true guardsmen as well as the false as youll tell my sister and for the sake of her beloved brother she will consent despite her misgivings they made their way down a deserted colonnade still the loss of her red cloaks will surely make her uneasy i like her uneasy said tyrion ser cleos frey left that very afternoon escorted by vylarr and a hundred redcloaked lannister guardsmen the men robb stark had sent joined them at the kings gate for the long ride west tyrion found timett dicing with his burned men in the barracks come to my solar at midnight timett gave him a hard oneeyed stare a curt nod he was not one for long speeches that night he feasted with the stone crows and moon brothers in the small hall though he shunned the wine for once he wanted all his wits about him shagga what moon is this shaggas frown was a fierce thing black i think in the west they call that a traitors moon try not to get too drunk tonight and see that your axe is page sharp a stone crows axe is always sharp and shaggas axes are sharpest of all once i cut off a mans head but he did not know it until he tried to brush his hair then it fell off is that why you never brush yours the stone crows roared and stamped their feet shagga hooting loudest of all by midnight the castle was silent and dark doubtless a few gold cloaks on the walls spied them leaving the tower of the hand but no one raised a voice he was the hand of the king and where he went was his own affair the thin wooden door split with a thunderous crack beneath the heel of shaggas boot pieces went flying inward and tyrion heard a womans gasp of fear shagga hacked the door apart with three great blows of his axe and kicked his way through the ruins timett followed and then tyrion stepping gingerly over the splinters the fire had burned down a few glowing embers and shadows lay thick across the bedchamber when timett ripped the heavy curtains off the bed the naked serving girl stared up with wide white eyes please my lords she pleaded dont hurt me she cringed away from shagga flushed and fearful trying to cover her charms with her hands and coming up a hand short go tyrion told her its not you we want shagga wants this woman shagga wants every whore in this city of whores complained timett son of timett yes shagga said unabashed shagga would give her a strong child if she wants a strong child shell know whom to seek tyrion said timett see her out gently if you would the burned man pulled the girl from the bed and half marched half dragged her across the chamber shagga watched them go mournful as a puppy the girl stumbled over the shattered door and out into the hall helped along by a firm shove from timett above their heads the ravens were screeching tyrion dragged the soft blanket off the bed uncovering grand maester pycelle beneath tell me does the citadel approve of you bedding the serving wenches maester the old man was as naked as the girl though he made a markedly less attractive sight for once his heavylidded eyes were open wide wwhat is the meaning of this i am an old man your loyal servant tyrion hoisted himself onto the bed so loyal that you sent only one of my letters to doran martell the other you gave to my sister nno squealed pycelle no a falsehood i swear it it was not me varys it was varys the spider i warned you do all maesters lie so poorly i told varys that i was giving prince doran my nephew tornmen to foster i told littlefinger that i planned to wed myrcella to lord robert of the eyrie i told no one that i had offered myrcella to the dornish that truth was only in the letter i entrusted to you page pycelle clutched for a corner of the blanket birds are lost messages stolen or sold it was varys there are things i might tell you of that eunuch that would chill your blood my lady prefers my blood hot make no mistake for every secret the eunuch whispers in your ear he holds seven back and littlefinger that one i know all about lord petyr hes almost as untrustworthy as you shagga cut off his manhood and feed it to the goats shagga hefted the huge doublebladed axe there are no goats halfman make do roaring shagga leapt forward pycelle shrieked and wet the bed urine spraying in all directions as he tried to scramble back out of reach the wildling caught him by the end of his billowy white beard and hacked off threequarters of it with a single slash of the axe timett do you suppose our friend will be more forthcoming without those whiskers to hide behind tyrion used a bit of the sheet to wipe the piss off his boots he will tell the truth soon darkness pooled in the empty pit of timetts burned eye i can smell the stink of his fear shagga tossed a handful of hair down to the rushes and seized what beard was left hold still maester urged tyrion when shagga gets angry his hands shake shaggas hands never shake the huge man said indignantly pressing the great crescent blade under pycelles quivering chin and sawing through another tangle of beard how long have you been spying for my sister tyrion asked pycelles breathing was rapid and shallow all i did i did for house lannister a sheen of sweat covered the broad dome of the old mans brow and wisps of white hair clung to his wrinkled skin always for years your lord father ask him i was ever his true servant twas i who bid aerys open his gates that took tyrion by surprise he had been no more than an ugly boy at casterly rock when the city fell so the sack of kings landing was your work as well for the realm once rhaegar died the war was done aerys was mad viserys too young prince aegon a babe at the breast but the realm needed a king i prayed it should be your good father but robert was too strong and lord stark moved too swiftly how many have you betrayed i wonder aerys eddard stark me king robert as well lord arryn prince rhaegar where does it begin pycelle he knew where it ended the axe scratched at the apple of pycelles throat and stroked the soft wobbly skin under his jaw scraping away the last hairs you were not here he gasped when the blade moved upward to his page cheeks robert his wounds if you had seen them smelled them you would have no doubt oh i know the boar did your work for you but if hed left the job half done doubtless you would have finished it he was a wretched king vain drunken lecherous he would have set your sister aside his own queen please renly was plotting to bring the highgarden maid to court to entice his brother it is the gods own truth and what was lord arryn plotting he knew pycelle said about about i know what he knew about snapped tyrion who was not anxious for shagga and timett to know as well he was sending his wife back to the eyrie and his son to be fostered on dragonstone he meant to act so you poisoned him first no pycelle struggled feebly shagga growled and grabbed his head the clansmans hand was so big he could have crushed the maesters skull like an eggshell had he squeezed tyrion tsked at him i saw the tears of lys among your potions and you sent away lord arryns own maester and tended him yourself so you could make certain that he died a falsehood shave him closer tyrion suggested the throat again the axe swept back down rasping over the skin a thin film of spit bubbled on pycelles lips as his mouth trembled i tried to save lord arryn i vow careful now shagga youve cut him shagga growled dolf fathered warriors not barbers when he felt the blood trickling down his neck and onto his chest the old man shuddered and the last strength went out of him he looked shrunken both smaller and frailer than he had been when they burst in on him yes he wimpered yes colemon was purging so i sent him away the queen needed lord arryn dead she did not say so could not varys was listening always listening but when i looked at her i knew it was not me who gave him the poison though i swear it the old man wept varys will tell you it was the boy his squire hugh he was called he must surely have done it ask your sister ask her tyrion was disgusted bind him and take him away he commanded throw him down in one of the black cells they dragged him out the splintered door lannister he moaned all ive done has been for lannister page when he was gone tyrion made a leisurely search of the quarters and collected a few more small jars from his shelves the ravens muttered above his head as he worked a strangely peaceful noise he would need to find someone to tend the birds until the citadel sent a man to replace pycelle he was the one id hoped to trust varys and littlefinger were no more loyal he suspected only more subtle and thus more dangerous perhaps his fathers way would have been best summon ilyn payne mount three heads above the gates and have done and wouldnt that be a pretty sight he thought chapter arya fear cuts deeper than swords arya would tell herself but that did not make the fear go away it was as much a part of her days as stale bread and the blisters on her toes after a long day of walking the hard rutted road she had thought she had known what it meant to be afraid but she learned better in that storehouse beside the gods eye eight days she had lingered there before the mountain gave the command to march and every day she had seen someone die the mountain would come into the storehouse after he had broken his fast and pick one of the prisoners for questioning the village folk would never look at him maybe they thought that if they did not notice him he would not notice them but he saw them anyway and picked whom he liked there was no place to hide no tricks to play no way to be safe one girl shared a soldiers bed three nights running the mountain picked her on the fourth day and the soldier said nothing a smiley old man mended their clothing and babbled about his son off serving in the gold cloaks at kings landing a kings man he is he would say a good kings man like me all for joffrey he said it so often the other captives began to call him allforjoffrey whenever the guards werent listening allforjoffrey was picked on the fifth day a young mother with a poxscarred face offered to freely tell them all she knew if theyd promise not to hurt her daughter the mountain heard her out the next morning he picked her daughter to be certain shed held nothing back the ones chosen were questioned in full view of the other captives so they could see the fate of rebels and traitors a man the others called the tickler asked the questions his face was so ordinary and his garb so plain that arya might have thought him one of the villagers before she had seen him at his work tickler makes them howl so hard they piss themselves old stoopshoulder chiswyck told them he was the man shed tried to bite whod called her a fierce little thing and smashed her head with a mailed fist sometimes he helped the tickler sometimes others did that ser gregor clegane himself would stand motionless watching and listening until the victim died page the questions were always the same was there gold hidden in the village silver gems was there more food where was lord beric dondarrion which of the village folk had aided him when he rode off where did he go how many men were with them how many knights how many bowmen how many menatarms how were they armed how many were horsed how many were wounded what other enemy had they seen how many when what banners did they fly where did they go was there gold hidden in the village silver gems where was lord beric dondarrion how many men were with him by the third day arya could have asked the questions herself they found a little gold a little silver a great sack of copper pennies and a dented goblet set with garnets that two soldiers almost came to blows over they learned that lord beric had ten starvelings with him or else a hundred mounted knights that he had ridden west or north or south that he had crossed the lake in a boat that he was strong as an aurochs or weak from the bloody flux no one ever survived the ticklers questioning no man no woman no child the strongest lasted past evenfall their bodies were hung beyond the fires for the wolves by the time they marched arya knew she was no water dancer syrio forel would never have let them knock him down and take his sword away nor stood by when they killed lommy greenhands syrio would never have sat silent in that storehouse nor shuffled along meekly among the other captives the direwolf was the sigil of the starks but arya felt more a lamb surrounded by a herd of other sheep she hated the villagers for their sheepishness almost as much as she hated herself the lannisters had taken everything father friends home hope courage one had taken needle while another had broken her wooden stick sword over his knee they had even taken her stupid secret the storehouse had been big enough for her to creep off and make her water in some corner when no one was looking but it was different on the road she held it as long as she could but finally she had to squat by a bush and skin down her breeches in front of all of them it was that or wet herself hot pie gaped at her with big moon eyes but no one else even troubled to look girl sheep or boy sheep ser gregor and his men did not seem to care their captors permitted no chatter a broken lip taught arya to hold her tongue others never learned at all one boy of three would not stop calling for his father so they smashed his face in with a spiked mace then the boys mother started screaming and raff the sweetling killed her as well arya watched them die and did nothing what good did it do you to be brave one of the women picked for questioning had tried to be brave but she had died screaming like all the rest there were no brave people on that march only scared and hungry ones most were women and children the few men were very old or very young the rest had been chained to that gibbet and left for the wolves and the crows gendry was only spared because hed admitted to forging the horned helm himself smiths even apprentice smiths were too valuable to kill they were being taken to serve lord tywin lannister at harrenhal the mountain told them youre traitors and rebels so thank your gods that lord tywins giving you this chance its more than youd get from the outlaws obey serve and live its not just its not she heard one wizened old woman complain to another when they had bedded down for the night we never did no treason the others come in and took what they wanted same as this bunch lord beric did us no hurt though her friend whispered and that red priest with him he paid for all page they took paid he took two of my chickens and gave me a bit of paper with a mark on it can i eat a bit of raggy old paper i ask you will it give me eggs she looked about to see that no guards were near and spat three times theres for the tullys and theres for the lannisters and theres for the starks its a sin and a shame an old man hissed when the old king was still alive hed not have stood for this king robert arya asked forgetting herself king aerys gods grace him the old man said too loudly a guard came sauntering over to shut them up the old man lost both his teeth and there was no more talk that night besides his captives ser gregor was bringing back a dozen pigs a cage of chickens a scrawny milk cow and nine wagons of salt fish the mountain and his men had horses but the captives were all afoot and those too weak to keep up were killed out of hand along with anyone foolish enough to flee the guards took women off into the bushes at night and most seemed to expect it and went along meekly enough one girl prettier than the others was made to go with four or five different men every night until finally she hit one with a rock ser gregor made everyone watch while he took off her head with a sweep of his massive twohanded greatsword leave the body for the wolves he commanded when the deed was done handing the sword to his squire to be cleaned arya glanced sidelong at needle sheathed at the hip of a blackbearded balding manatarms called polliver its good that they took it away she thought otherwise she would have tried to stab ser gregor and he would have cut her right in half and the wolves would eat her too polliver was not so bad as some of the others even though hed stolen needle the night she was caught the lannister men had been nameless strangers with faces as alike as their nasal helms but shed come to know them all you had to know who was lazy and who was cruel who was smart and who was stupid you had to learn that even though the one they called shitmouth had the foulest tongue shed ever heard hed give you an extra piece of bread if you asked while jolly old chiswyck and softspoken raff would just give you the back of their hand arya watched and listened and polished her hates the way gendry had once polished his horned helm dunsen wore those bulls horns now and she hated him for it she hated polliver for needle and she hated old chiswyck who thought he was funny and raff the sweetling whod driven his spear through lommys throat she hated even more she hated ser amory lorch for yoren and she hated ser meryn trant for syrio the hound for killing the butchers boy mycah and ser ilyn and prince joffrey and the queen for the sake of her father and fat tom and desmond and the rest and even for lady sansas wolf the tickler was almost too scary to hate at times she could almost forget he was still with them when he was not asking questions he was just another soldier quieter than most with a face like a thousand other men every night arya would say their names ser gregor shed whisper to her stone pillow dunsen polliver chiswyck raff the sweetling the tickler and the hound ser amory ser ilyn ser meryn king joffrey queen cersei back in winterfell arya had prayed with her mother in the sept and with her father in the godswood but there were no gods on the road to harrenhal and her names were the only prayer she cared to remember page every day they marched and every night she said her names until finally the trees thinned and gave way to a patchwork landscape of rolling hills meandering streams and sunlit fields where the husks of burnt holdfasts thrust up black as rotten teeth it was another long days march before they glimpsed the towers of harrenhal in the distance hard beside the blue waters of the lake it would be better once they got to harrenhal the captives told each other but arya was not so certain she remembered old nans stories of the castle built on fear harren the black had mixed human blood in the mortar nan used to say dropping her voice so the children would need to lean close to hear but aegons dragons had roasted harren and all his sons within their great walls of stone arya chewed her lip as she walked along on feet grown hard with callus it would not be much longer she told herself those towers could not be more than a few miles off yet they walked all that day and most of the next before at last they reached the fringes of lord tywins army encamped west of the castle amidst the scorched remains of a town harrenhal was deceptive from afar because it was so huge its colossal curtain walls rose beside the lake sheer and sudden as mountain cliffs while atop their battlements the rows of woodandiron scorpions looked as small as the bugs for which they were named the stink of the lannister host reached arya well before she could make out the devices on the banners that sprouted along the lakeshore atop the pavilions of the westermen from the smell arya could tell that lord tywin had been here some time the latrines that ringed the encampment were overflowing and swarming with flies and she saw faint greenish fuzz on many of the sharpened stakes that protected the perimeters harrenhals gatehouse itself as large as winterfells great keep was as scarred as it was massive its stones fissured and discolored from outside only the tops of five immense towers could be seen beyond the walls the shortest of them was half again as tall as the highest tower in winterfell but they did not soar the way a proper tower did arya thought they looked like some old mans gnarled knuckly fingers groping after a passing cloud she remembered nan telling how the stone had melted and flowed like candlewax down the steps and in the windows glowing a sullen searing red as it sought out harren where he hid arya could believe every word each tower was more grotesque and misshapen than the last lumpy and runneled and cracked i dont want to go there hot pie squeaked as harrenhal opened its gates to them theres ghosts in there chiswyck heard him but for once he only smiled baker boy heres your choice come join the ghosts or be one hot pie went in with the rest of them in the echoing stoneandtimber bathhouse the captives were stripped and made to scrub and scrape themselves raw in tubs of scalding hot water two fierce old women supervised the process discussing them as bluntly as if they were newly acquired donkeys when aryas turn came round goodwife amabel clucked in dismay at the sight of her feet while goodwife harra felt the callus on her fingers that long hours of practice with needle had earned her got those churning butter ill wager she said some farmers whelp are you well never you mind girl you have a chance to win a higher place in this world if you work hard if you wont work page hard youll be beaten and what do they call you arya dared not say her true name but arry was no good either it was a boys name and they could see she was no boy weasel she said naming the first girl she could think of lommy called me weasel i can see why sniffed goodwife amabel that hair is a fright and a nest for lice as well well have it off and then youre for the kitchens id sooner tend the horses arya liked horses and maybe if she was in the stables shed be able to steal one and escape goodwife harra slapped her so hard that her swollen lip broke open all over again and keep that tongue to yourself or youll get worse no one asked your views the blood in her mouth had a salty metal tang to it arya dropped her gaze and said nothing ff i still had needle she wouldnt dare hit me she thought sullenly lord tywin and his knights have grooms and squires to tend their horses they dont need the likes of you goodwife amabel said the kitchens are snug and clean and theres always a warm fire to sleep by and plenty to eat you might have done well there but i can see youre not a clever girl harra i believe we should give this one to weese if you think so amabel they gave her a shift of grey roughspun wool and a pair of illfitting shoes and sent her off weese was understeward for the wailing tower a squat man with a fleshy carbuncle of a nose and a nest of angry red boils near one corner of his plump lips arya was one of six sent to him he looked them all over with a gimlet eye the lannisters are generous to those as serve them well an honor none of your sort deserve but in war a man makes do with whats to hand work hard and mind your place and might be one day youll rise as high as me if you think to presume on his lordships kindness though youll find me waiting after mlord has gone ysee he strutted up and down before them telling them how they must never look the highborn in the eye nor speak until spoken to nor get in his lordships way my nose never lies he boasted i can smell defiance i can smell pride i can smell disobedience i catch a whiff of any such stinks youll answer for it when i sniff you all i want to smell is fear chapter daenerys n the walls of qarth men beat gongs to herald her coming while others blew curious horns that encircled their bodies like great bronze snakes a column of camelry emerged from the city as her honor guards the riders wore scaled copper armor and snouted helms with copper tusks and long black silk plumes and sat high on saddles inlaid with rubies and garnets their camels were dressed in blankets of a hundred different hues qarth is the greatest city that ever was or ever will be pyat pree had told her back amongst the bones of vaes tolorro it is the center of the world the gate between north and south the bridge between east page and west ancient beyond memory of man and so magnificent that saathos the wise put out his eyes after gazing upon qarth for the first time because he knew that all he saw thereafter should look squalid and ugly by comparison dany took the warlocks words well salted but the magnificence of the great city was not to be denied three thick walls encircled qarth elaborately carved the outer was red sandstone thirty feet high and decorated with animals snakes slithering kites flying fish swimming intermingled with wolves of the red waste and striped zorses and monstrous elephants the middle wall forty feet high was grey granite alive with scenes of war the clash of sword and shield and spear arrows in flight heroes at battle and babes being butchered pyres of the dead the innermost wall was fifty feet of black marble with carvings that made dany blush until she told herself that she was being a fool she was no maid if she could look on the grey walls scenes of slaughter why should she avert her eyes from the sight of men and women giving pleasure to one another the outer gates were banded with copper the middle with iron the innermost were studded with golden eyes all opened at danys approach as she rode her silver into the city small children rushd out to scatter flowers in her path they wore golden sandals and bright paint no more all the colors that had been missing from vaes tolorro had found their way to qarth buildings crowded about her fantastical as a fever dream in shades of rose violet and umber she passed under a bronze arch fashioned in the likeness of two snakes mating their scales delicate flakes of jade obsidian and lapis lazuli slim towers stood taller than any dany had ever seen and elaborate fountains filled every square wrought in the shapes of griffins and dragons and manticores the qartheen lined the streets and watched from delicate balconies that looked too frail to support their weight they were tall pale folk in linen and samite and tiger fur every one a lord or lady to her eyes the women wore gowns that left one breast bare while the men favored beaded silk skirts dany felt shabby and barbaric as she rode past them in her lionskin robe with black drogon on one shoulder her dothraki called the qartheen milk men for their paleness and khal drogo had dreamed of the day when he might sack the great cities of the east she glanced at her bloodriders their dark almondshaped eyes giving no hint of their thoughts is it only the plunder they see she wondered how savage we must seem to these qartheen pyrat pree conducted her little khalasar down the center of a great arcade where the citys ancient heroes stood thrice lifesize on columns of white and green marble they passed through a bazaar in a cavernous building whose latticework ceiling was home to a thousand gaily colored birds trees and flowers bloomed on the terraced walls above the stalls while below it seemed as if everything the gods had put into the world was for sale her silver shied as the merchant prince xaro xhoan daxos rode up to her the horses could not abide the close presence of camels she had found if you see here anything that you would desire most beautiful of women you have only to speak and it is yours xaro called down from his ornate horned saddle qarth itself is hers she has no need of baubles bluelipped pyat pree sang out from her other side it shall be as i promised khaleesi come with me to the house of the undying and you shall drink of truth and wisdom why should she need your palace of dust when i can give her sunlight and sweet water and silks to page sleep in xaro said to the warlock the thirteen shall set a crown of black jade and fire opals upon her lovely head the only palace i desire is the red castle at kings landing my lord pyat dany was wary of the warlock the maegi mirri maz duur had soured her on those who played at sorcery and if the great of qarth would give me gifts xaro let them give me ships and swords to win back what is rightfully mine pyats blue lips curled upward in a gracious smile it shall be as you command khaleesi he moved away swaying with his camels motion his long beaded robes trailing behind the young queen is wise beyond her years xaro xhoan daxos murmured down at her from his high saddle there is a saying in qarth a warlocks house is built of bones and lies then why do men lower their voices when they speak of the warlocks of qarth all across the east their power and wisdom are revered once they were mighty xaro agreed but now they are as ludicrous as those feeble old soldiers who boast of their prowess long after strength and skill have left them they read their crumbling scrolls drink shadeoftheevening until their lips turn blue and hint of dread powers but they are hollow husks compared to those who went before pyat prees gifts will turn to dust in your hands i warn you he gave his camel a lick of his whip and sped away the crow calls the raven black muttered ser jorah in the common tongue of westeros the exile knight rode at her right hand as ever for their entrance into qarth he had put away his dothraki garb and donned again the plate and mail and wool of the seven kingdoms half a world away you would do well to avoid both those men your grace those men will help me to my crown she said xaro has vast wealth and pyat pree pretends to power the knight said brusquely on his dark green surcoat the bear of house mormont stood on its hind legs black and fierce jorah looked no less ferocious as he scowled at the crowd that filled the bazaar i would not linger here long my queen i mislike the very smell of this place dany smiled perhaps its the camels youre smelling the qartheen themselves seem sweet enough to my nose sweet smells are sometimes used to cover foul ones my great bear dany thought i am his queen but i will always be his cub as well and he will always guard me it made her feel safe but sad as well she wished she could love him better than she did xaro xhoan daxos had offered dany the hospitality of his home while she was in the city she had expected something grand she had not expected a palace larger than many a market town it makes magister illyrios manse in pentos look like a swineherds hovel she thought xaro swore that his home could comfortably house all of her people and their horses besides indeed it swallowed them an entire wing was given over to her she would have her own gardens a marble bathing pool a scrying tower and warlocks maze slaves would tend her every need in her private chambers the floors were green marble the walls draped with colorful silk hangings that shimmered with every breath of air you are too generous she told xaro xhoan daxos for the mother of dragons no gift is too great xaro was a languid elegant man with a bald head and page a great beak of a nose crusted with rubies opals and flakes of jade on the morrow you shall feast upon peacock and larks tongue and hear music worthy of the most beautiful of women the thirteen will come to do you homage and all the great of qarth all the great of qarth will come to see my dragons dany thought yet she thanked xaro for his kindness before she sent him on his way pyat pree took his leave as well vowing to petition the undying ones for an audience a honor rare as summer snows before he left he kissed her bare feet with his pale blue lips and pressed on her a gift a jar of ointment that he swore would let her see the spirits of the air last of the three seekers to depart was quaithe the shadowbinder from her dany received only a warning beware the woman in the red lacquer mask said of whom of all they shall come day and night to see the wonder that has been born again into the world and when they see they shall lust for dragons are fire made flesh and fire is power when quaithe too was gone ser jorah said she speaks truly my queen though i like her no more than the others i do not understand her pyat and xaro had showered dany with promises from the moment they first glimpsed her dragons declaring themselves her loyal servants in all things but from quaithe she had gotten only the rare cryptic word and it disturbed her that she had never seen the womans face remember mirri maz duur she told herself remember treachery she turned to her bloodriders we will keep our own watch so long as we are here see that no one enters this wing of the palace without my leave and take care that the dragons are always well guarded it shall be done khaleesi aggo said we have seen only the parts of qarth that pyat pree wished us to see she went on rakharo go forth and look on the rest and tell me what you find take good men with youand women to go places where men are forbidden as you say i do blood of my blood said rakharo ser jorah find the docks and see what manner of ships lay at anchor it has been half a year since i last heard tidings from the seven kingdoms perhaps the gods will have blown some good captain here from westeros with a ship to carry us home the knight frowned that would be no kindness the usurper will kill you sure as sunrise mormont hooked his thumbs through his swordbelt my place is here at your side jhogo can guard me as well you have more languages than my bloodriders and the dothraki mistrust the sea and those who sail her only you can serve me in this go among the ships and speak to the crews learn where they are from and where they are bound and what manner of men command them reluctantly the exile nodded as you say my queen when all the men had gone her handmaids stripped off the travelstained silks she wore and dany padded out to where the marble pool sat in the shade of a portico the water was deliciously cool and the pool was stocked with tiny golden fish that nibbled curiously at her skin and made her giggle it felt page good to close her eyes and float knowing she could rest as long as she liked she wondered whether aegons red keep had a pool like this and fragrant gardens full of lavender and mint it must surely viserys always said the seven kingdoms were more beautiful than any other place in the world the thought of home disquieted her if her sunandstars had lived he would have led his khalasar across the poison water and swept away her enemies but his strength had left the world her bloodriders remained sworn to her for life and skilled in slaughter but only in the ways of the horselords the dothraki sacked cities and plundered kingdoms they did not rule them dany had no wish to reduce kings landing to a blackened ruin full of unquiet ghosts she had supped enough on tears i want to make my kingdom beautiful to fill it with fat men and pretty maids and laughing children i want my people to smile when they see me ride by the way viserys said they smiled for my father but before she could do that she must conquer the usurper will kill you sure as sunrise mormont had said robert had slain her gallant brother rhaegar and one of his creatures had crossed the dothraki sea to poison her and her unborn son they said robert baratheon was strong as a bull and fearless in battle a man who loved nothing better than war and with him stood the great lords her brother had named the usurpers dogs coldeyed eddard stark with his frozen heart and the golden lannisters father and son so rich so powerful so treacherous how could she hope to overthrow such men when khal drogo had lived men trembled and made him gifts to stay his wrath if they did not he took their cities wealth and wives and all but his khalasar had been vast while hers was meager her people had followed her across the red waste as she chased her comet and would follow her across the poison water too but they would not be enough even her dragons might not be enough viserys had believed that the realm would rise for its rightful king but viserys had been a fool and fools believe in foolish things her doubts made her shiver suddenly the water felt cold to her and the little fish prickling at her skin annoying dany stood and climbed from the pool irri she called jhiqui as the handmaids toweled her dry and wrapped her in a sandsilk robe danys thoughts went to the three who had sought her out in the city of bones the bleeding star led me to qarth for a purpose here i will find what i need if i have the strength to take what is offered and the wisdom to avoid the traps and snares if the gods mean for me to conquer they will provide they will send me a sign and if not if not it was near evenfall and dany was feeding her dragons when irri stepped through the silken curtains to tell her that ser jorah had returned from the docks and not alone send him in with whomever he has brought she said curious when they entered she was seated on a mound of cushions her dragons all about her the man he brought with him wore a cloak of green and yellow feathers and had skin as black as polished jet your grace the knight said i bring you quhuru mo captain of the cinnamon wind out of tall trees town the black man knelt i am greatly honored my queen he said not in the tongue of the summer isles which dany did not know but in the liquid valyrian of the nine free cities the honor is mine quhuru mo said dany in the same language have you come from the summer isles page this is so your grace but before not half a year past we called at oldtown from there i bring you a wondrous gift a gift a gift of news dragonmother stormborn i tell you true robert baratheon is dead outside her walls dusk was settling over qarth but a sun had risen in danys heart dead she repeated in her lap black drogon hissed and pale smoke rose before her face like a veil you are certain the usurper is dead so it is said in oldtown and dorne and lys and all the other ports where we have called he sent me poisoned wine yet i live and he is gone what was the manner of his death on her shoulder pale viserion flapped wings the color of cream stirring the air torn by a monstrous boar whilst hunting in his kingswood or so i heard in oldtown others say his queen betrayed him or his brother or lord stark who was his hand yet all the tales agree in this king robert is dead and in his grave dany had never looked upon the usurpers face yet seldom a day had passed when she had not thought of him his great shadow had lain across her since the hour of her birth when she came forth amidst blood and storm into a world where she no longer had a place and now this ebony stranger had lifted that shadow the boy sits the iron throne now ser jorah said king joffrey reigns quhuru mo agreed but the lannisters rule roberts brothers have fled kings landing the talk is they mean to claim the crown and the hand has fallen lord stark who was king roberts friend he has been seized for treason ned stark a traitor ser jorah snorted not bloody likely the long summer will come again before that one would besmirch his precious honor what honor could he have dany said he was a traitor to his true king as were these lannisters it pleased her to hear that the usurpers dogs were fighting amongst themselves though she was unsurprised the same thing happened when her drogo died and his great khalasar tore itself to pieces my brother is dead as well viserys who was the true king she told the summer islander khal drogo my lord husband killed him with a crown of molten gold would her brother have been any wiser had he known that the vengeance he had prayed for was so close at hand then i grieve for you dragonmother and for bleeding westeros bereft of its rightful king beneath danys gentle fingers green rhaegal stared at the stranger with eyes of molten gold when his mouth opened his teeth gleamed like black needles when does your ship return to westeros captain not for a year or more i fear from here the cinnamon wind sails east to make the traders circle round the jade sea page i see said dany disappointed i wish you fair winds and good trading then you have brought me a precious gift i have been amply repaid great queen she puzzled at that how so his eyes gleamed i have seen dragons dany laughed and will see more of them one day i hope come to me in kings landing when i am on my fathers throne and you shall have a great reward the summer islander promised he would do so and kissed her lightly on the fingers as he took his leave jhiqui showed him out while ser jorah mormont remained khaleesi the knight said when they were alone i should not speak so freely of your plans if i were you this man will spread the tale wherever he goes now let him she said let the whole world know my purpose the usurper is dead what does it matter not every sailors tale is true ser jorah cautioned and even if robert be truly dead his son rules in his place this changes nothing truly this changes everything dany rose abruptly screeching her dragons uncoiled and spread their wings drogon flapped and clawed up to the lintel over the archway the others skittered across the floor wingtips scrabbling on the marble before the seven kingdoms were like my drogos khalasar a hundred thousand made as one by his strength now they fly to pieces even as the khalasar did after my khal lay dead the high lords have always fought tell me whos won and ill tell you what it means khaleesi the seven kingdoms are not going to fall into your hands like so many ripe peaches you will need a fleet gold armies alliances all this i know she took his hands in hers and looked up into his dark suspicious eyes sometimes he thinks of me as a child he must protect and sometimes as a woman he would like to bed but does he ever truly see me as his queen i am not the frightened girl you met in pentos i have counted only fifteen name days true but i am as old as the crones in the dosh khaleen and as young as my dragons jorah i have borne a child burned a khal and crossed the red waste and the dothraki sea mine is the blood of the dragon as was your brothers he said stubbornly i am not viserys no he admitted there is more of rhaegar in you i think but even rhaegar could be slain robert proved that on the trident with no more than a warhammer even dragons can die dragons die she stood on her toes to kiss him lightly on an unshaven cheek but so do dragonslayers page chapter bran meera moved in a wary circle her net dangling loose in her left hand the slender threepronged frog spear poised in her right summer followed her with his golden eyes turning his tail held stiff and tall watching watching yai the girl shouted the spear darting out the wolf slid to the left and leapt before she could draw back the spear meera cast her net the tangles unfolding in the air before her summers leap carried him into it he dragged it with him as he slammed into her chest and knocked her over backward her spear went spinning away the damp grass cushioned her fall but the breath went out of her in an oof the wolf crouched atop her bran hooted you lose she wins her brother jojen said summers snared he was right bran saw thrashing and growling at the net trying to rip free summer was only ensnaring himself worse nor could he bite through let him out laughing the reed girl threw her arms around the tangled wolf and rolled them both summer gave a piteous whine his legs kicking against the cords that bound them meera knelt undid a twist pulled at a corner tugged deftly here and there and suddenly the direwolf was bounding free summer to me bran spread his arms watch he said an instant before the wolf bowled into him he clung with all his strength as the wolf dragged him bumping through the grass they wrestled and rolled and clung to each other one snarling and yapping the other laughing in the end it was bran sprawled on top the mudspattered direwolf under him good wolf he panted summer licked him across the ear meera shook her head does he never grow angry not with me bran grabbed the wolf by his ears and summer snapped at him fiercely but it was all in play sometimes he tears my garb but hes never drawn blood your blood you mean if hed gotten past my net he wouldnt hurt you he knows i like you all of the other lords and knights had departed within a day or two of the harvest feast but the reeds had stayed to become brans constant companions jojen was so solemn that old nan called him little grandfather but meera reminded bran of his sister arya she wasnt scared to get dirty and she could run and fight and throw as good as a boy she was older than arya though almost sixteen a woman grown they were both older than bran even though his ninth name day had finally come and gone but they never treated him like a child i wish you were our wards instead of the walders he began to struggle toward the nearest tree his page dragging and wriggling was unseemly to watch but when meera moved to lift him he said no dont help me he rolled clumsily and pushed and squirmed backward using the strength of his arms until he was sitting with his back to the trunk of a tall ash see i told you summer lay down with his head in brans lap i never knew anyone who fought with a net before he told meera while he scratched the direwolf between the ears did your masteratarms teach you netfighting my father taught me we have no knights at greywater no masteratarms and no maester who keeps your ravens she smiled ravens cant find greywater watch no more than our enemies can why not because it moves she told him bran had never heard of a moving castle before he looked at her uncertainly but he couldnt tell whether she was teasing him or not i wish i could see it do you think your lord father would let me come visit when the war is over you would be most welcome my prince then or now now bran had spent his whole life at winterfell he yearned to see far places i could ask ser rodrik when he returns the old knight was off east trying to set to rights the trouble there roose boltons bastard had started it by seizing lady hornwood as she returned from the harvest feast marrying her that very night even though he was young enough to be her son then lord manderly had taken her castle to protect the hornwood holdings from the boltons he had written but ser rodrik had been almost as angry with him as with the bastard ser rodrik might let me go maester luwin never would sitting crosslegged under the weirwood jojen reed regarded him solemnly it would be good if you left winterfell bran it would yes and sooner rather than later my brother has the greensight said meera he dreams things that havent happened but sometimes they do there is no sometimes meera a look passed between them him sad her defiant tell me whats going to happen bran said i will said jojen if youll tell me about your dreams the godswood grew quiet bran could hear leaves rustling and hodors distant splashing from the hot pools he thought of the golden man and the threeeyed crow remembered the crunch of bones between his jaws and the coppery taste of blood i dont have dreams maester luwin gives me sleeping draughts page do they help sometimes meera said all of winterfell knows you wake at night shouting and sweating bran the women talk of it at the well and the guards in their hall tell us what frightens you so much said jojen i dont want to anyway its only dreams maester luwin says dreams might mean anything or nothing my brother dreams as other boys do and those dreams might mean anything meera said but the green dreams are different jojens eyes were the color of moss and sometimes when he looked at you he seemed to be seeing something else like now i dreamed of a winged wolf bound to earth with grey stone chains he said it was a green dream so i knew it was true a crow was trying to peck through the chains but the stone was too hard and his beak could only chip at them did the crow have three eyes jojen nodded summer raised his head from brans lap and gazed at the mudman with his dark golden eyes when i was little i almost died of greywater fever that was when the crow came to me he came to me after i fell bran blurted i was asleep for a long time he said i had to fly or die and i woke up only i was broken and i couldnt fly after all you can if you want to picking up her net meera shook out the last tangles and began arranging it in loose folds you are the winged wolf bran said jojen i wasnt sure when we first came but now i am the crow sent us here to break your chains is the crow at greywater no the crow is in the north at the wall bran had always wanted to see the wall his bastard brother jon was there now a man of the nights watch beyond the wall meera reed hung the net from her belt when jojen told our lord father what hed dreamed he sent us to winterfell how would i break the chains jojen bran asked open your eye page they are open cant you see two are open jojen pointed one two i only have two you have three the crow gave you the third but you will not open it he had a slow soft way of speaking with two eyes you see my face with three you could see my heart with two you can see that oak tree there with three you could see the acorn the oak grew from and the stump that it will one day become with two you see no farther than your walls with three you would gaze south to the summer sea and north beyond the wall summer got to his feet i dont need to see so far bran made a nervous smile im tired of talking about crows lets talk about wolves or lizardlions have you ever hunted one meera we dont have them here meera plucked her frog spear out of the bushes they live in the water in slow streams and deep swamps her brother interrupted did you dream of a lizardlion no said bran i told you i dont want did you dream of a wolf he was making bran angry i dont have to tell you my dreams im the prince im the stark in winterfell was it summer you be quiet the night of the harvest feast you dreamed you were summer in the godswood didnt you stop it bran shouted summer slid toward the weirwood his white teeth bared jojen reed took no mind when i touched summer i felt you in him just as you are in him now you couldnt have i was in bed i was sleeping you were in the godswood all in grey it was only a bad dream jojen stood i felt you i felt you fall is that what scares you the falling the falling bran thought and the golden man the queens brother he scares me too but mostly the falling he did not say it though how could he he had not been able to tell ser rodrik or maester luwin and he could not tell the reeds either if he didnt talk about it maybe he would forget he had never wanted to remember it might not even be a true remembering page do you fall every night bran joien asked quietly a low rumbling growl rose from summers throat and there was no play in it he stalked forward all teeth and hot eyes meera stepped between the wolf and her brother spear in hand keep him back bran jojen is making him angry meera shook out her net its your anger bran her brother said your fear it isnt im not a wolf yet hed howled with them in the night and tasted blood in his wolf dreams part of you is summer and part of summer is you you know that bran summer rushed forward but meera blocked him jabbing with the threepronged spear the wolf twisted aside circling stalking meera turned to face him call him back bran summer bran shouted to me summer he slapped an open palm down on the meat of his thigh his hand tingled though his dead leg felt nothing the direwolf lunged again and again meeras spear darted out summer dodged circled back the bushes rustled and a lean black shape came padding from behind the weirwood teeth bared the scent was strong his brother had smelled his rage bran felt hairs rise on the back of his neck meera stood beside her brother with wolves to either side bran call them off i cant jojen up the tree theres no need today is not the day i die do it she screamed and her brother scrambled up the trunk of the weirwood using the face for his handholds the direwolves closed meera abandoned spear and net jumped up and grabbed the branch above her head shaggys jaws snapped shut beneath her ankle as she swung up and over the limb summer sat back on his haunches and howled while shaggydog worried the net shaking it in his teeth only then did bran remember that they were not alone he cupped hands around his mouth hodor he shouted hodor hodor he was badly frightened and somehow ashamed they wont hurt hodor he assured his treed friends a few moments passed before they heard a tuneless humming hodor arrived halfdressed and mudspattered from his visit to the hot pools but bran had never been so glad to see him hodor help me chase off the wolves chase them off hodor went to it gleefully waving his arms and stamping his huge feet shouting hodor hodor running first at one wolf and then the other shaggydog was the first to flee slinking back into the foliage with a final snarl when summer had enough he came back to bran and lay down beside him page no sooner did meera touch ground than she snatched up her spear and net again jojen never took his eyes off summer we will talk again he promised bran it was the wolves it wasnt me he did not understand why theyd gotten so wild maybe maester luwin was right to lock them in the godswood hodor he said bring me to maester luwin the maesters turret below the rookery was one of brans favorite places luwin was hopelessly untidy but his clutter of books and scrolls and bottles was as familiar and comforting to bran as his bald spot and the flapping sleeves of his loose grey robes he liked the ravens too he found luwin perched on a high stool writing with ser rodrik gone all of the governance of the castle had fallen on his shoulders my prince he said when hodor entered youre early for lessons today the maester spent several hours every afternoon tutoring bran rickon and the walder freys hodor stand still bran grasped a wall sconce with both hands and used it to pull himself up and out of the basket he hung for a moment by his arms until hodor carried him to a chair meera says her brother has the greensight maester luwin scratched at the side of his nose with his writing quill does she now he nodded you told me that the children of the forest had the greensight i remember some claimed to have that power their wise men were called greenseers was it magic call it that for want of a better word if you must at heart it was only a different sort of knowledge what was it luwin set down his quill no one truly knows bran the children are gone from the world and their wisdom with them it had to do with the faces in the trees we think the first men believed that the greenseers could see through the eyes of the weirwoods that was why they cut down the trees whenever they warred upon the children supposedly the greenseers also had power over the beasts of the wood and the birds in the trees even fish does the reed boy claim such powers no i dont think but he has dreams that come true sometimes meera says all of us have dreams that come true sometimes you dreamed of your lord father in the crypts before we knew he was dead remember rickon did too we dreamed the same dream call it greensight if you wish but remember as well all those tens of thousands of dreams that you and rickon have dreamed that did not come true do you perchance recall what i taught you about the chain collar that every maester wears bran thought for a moment trying to remember a maester forges his chain in the citadel of oldtown its a chain because you swear to serve and its made of different metals because you serve the realm page and the realm has different sorts of people every time you learn something you get another link black iron is for ravenry silver for healing gold for sums and numbers i dont remember them all luwin slid a finger up under his collar and began to turn it inch by inch he had a thick neck for a small man and the chain was tight but a few pulls had it all the way around this is valyrian steel he said when the link of dark grey metal lay against the apple of his throat only one maester in a hundred wears such a link this signifies that i have studied what the citadel calls the higher mysteriesmagic for want of a better word a fascinating pursuit but of small use which is why so few maesters trouble themselves with it all those who study the higher mysteries try their own hand at spells soon or late i yielded to the temptation too i must confess it well i was a boy and what boy does not secretly wish to find hidden powers in himself i got no more for my efforts than a thousand boys before me and a thousand since sad to say magic does not work sometimes it does bran protested i had that dream and rickon did too and there are mages and warlocks in the east there are men who call themselves mages and warlocks maester luwin said i had a friend at the citadel who could pull a rose out of your ear but he was no more magical than i was oh to be sure there is much we do not understand the years pass in their hundreds and their thousands and what does any man see of life but a few summers a few winters we look at mountains and call them eternal and so they seem but in the course of time mountains rise and fall rivers change their courses stars fall from the sky and great cities sink beneath the sea even gods die we think everything changes perhaps magic was once a mighty force in the world but no longer what little remains is no more than the wisp of smoke that lingers in the air after a great fire has burned out and even that is fading valyria was the last ember and valyria is gone the dragons are no more the giants are dead the children of the forest forgotten with all their lore no my prince jojen reed may have had a dream or two that he believes came true but he does not have the greensight no living man has that power bran said as much to meera reed when she came to him at dusk as he sat in his window seat watching the lights flicker to life im sorry for what happened with the wolves summer shouldnt have tried to hurt jojen but jojen shouldnt have said all that about my dreams the crow lied when he said i could fly and your brother lied too or perhaps your maester is wrong he isnt even my father relied on his counsel your father listened i have no doubt but in the end he decided for himself bran will you let me tell you about a dream jojen dreamed of you and your fosterling brothers the walders arent my brothers she paid that no heed you were sitting at supper but instead of a servant maester luwin brought you your food he served you the kings cut off the roast the meat rare and bloody but with a savory smell page that made everyones mouth water the meat he served the freys was old and grey and dead yet they liked their supper better than you liked yours i dont understand you will my brother says when you do well talk again bran was almost afraid to sit to supper that night but when he did it was pigeon pie they set before him everyone else was served the same and he couldnt see that anything was wrong with the food they served the walders maester luwin has the truth of it he told himself nothing bad was coming to winterfell no matter what jojen said bran was relieved but disappointed too so long as there was magic anything could happen ghosts could walk trees could talk and broken boys could grow up to be knights but there isnt he said aloud in the darkness of his bed theres no magic and the stories are just stories and he would never walk nor fly nor be a knight chapter tyrion the rushes were scratchy under the soles of his bare feet my cousin chooses a queer hour to come visiting tyrion told a sleepbefuddled podrick payne whod doubtless expected to be well roasted for waking him see him to my solar and tell him ill be down shortly it was well past midnight he judged from the black outside the window does lancel think to find me drowsy and slow of wit at this hour he wondered no lance scarce thinks at all this is cerseis doing his sister would be disappointed even abed he worked well into the morningreading by the flickering light of a candle scrutinizing the reports of varyss whisperers and poring over littlefingers books of accounts until the columns blurred and his eyes ached he splashed some tepid water on his face from the basin beside his bed and took his time squatting in the garderobe the night air cold on his bare skin ser lancel was sixteen and not known for his patience let him wait and grow more anxious in the waiting when his bowels were empty tyrion slipped on a bedrobe and roughed his thin flaxen hair with his fingers all the more to look as if he had wakened from sleep lancel was pacing before the ashes of the hearth garbed in slashed red velvet with black silk undersleeves a jeweled dagger and a gilded scabbard hanging from his swordbelt cousin tyrion greeted him your visits are too few to what do i owe this undeserved pleasure her grace the queen regent has sent me to command you to release grand maester pycelle ser lancel showed tyrion a crimson ribbon bearing cerseis lion seal impressed in golden wax here is her warrant so it is tyrion waved it away i hope my sister is not overtaxing her strength so soon after her illness page it would be a great pity if she were to suffer a relapse her grace is quite recovered ser lancel said curtly music to my ears though not a tune im fond of i should have given her a larger dose tyrion had hoped for a few more days without cerseis interference but he was not too terribly surprised by her return to health she was jaimes twin after all he made himself smile pleasantly pod build us a fire the air is too chilly for my taste will you take a cup with me lancel i find that mulled wine helps me sleep i need no help sleeping ser lancel said i am come at her graces behest not to drink with you imp knighthood had made the boy bolder tyrion reflectedthat and the sorry part he had played in murdering king robert wine does have its dangers he smiled as he poured as to grand maester pycelle if my sweet sister is so concerned for him i would have thought shed come herself instead she sends you what am i to make of that make of it what you will so long as you release your prisoner the grand maester is a staunch friend to the queen regent and under her personal protection a hint of a sneer played about the lads lips he was enjoying this he takes his lessons from cersei her grace will never consent to this outrage she reminds you that she is joffreys regent as i am joffreys hand the hand serves the young knight informed him airily the regent rules until the king is of age perhaps you ought write that down so ill remember it better the fire was crackling merrily you may leave us pod tyrion told his squire only when the boy was gone did he turn back to lancel there is more yes her grace bids me inform you that ser jacelyn bywater defied a command issued in the kings own name which means that cersei has already ordered bywater to release pycelle and been rebuffed i see she insists that the man be removed from his office and placed under arrest for treason i warn you he set aside his wine cup ill hear no warnings from you boy ser lancel said stiffly he touched his sword perhaps to remind tyrion that he wore one have a care how you speak to me imp doubtless he meant to sound threatening but that absurd wisp of a mustache ruined the effect oh unhand your sword one cry from me and shagga will burst in and kill you with an axe not a wineskin lancel reddened was he such a fool as to believe his part in roberts death had gone unnoted i am a knight so ive noted tell medid cersei have you knighted before or after she took you into her bed page the flicker in lancels green eyes was all the admission tyrion needed so varys told it true well no one can ever claim that my sister does not love her family what nothing to say no more warnings for me ser you will withdraw these filthy accusations or please have you given any thought to what joffrey will do when i tell him you murdered his father to bed his mother it was not like that lancel protested horrified no what was it like pray the queen gave me the strongwine your own father lord tywin when i was named the kings squire he told me to obey her in everything did he tell you to fuck her too look at him not quite so tall his features not so fine and his hair is sand instead of spun gold yet still even a poor copy of faime is sweeter than an empty bed i suppose no i thought not i never meant i only did as i was bid i hated every instant of it is that what you would have me believe a high place at court knighthood my sisters legs opening for you at night oh yes it must have been terrible for you tyrion pushed himself to his feet wait here his grace will want to hear this the defiance went from lancel all at once the young knight fell to his knees a frightened boy mercy my lord i beg you save it for joffrey he likes a good beg my lord it was your sisters bidding the queen as you said but his grace hed never understand would you have me keep the truth from the king for my fathers sake ill leave the city it will be as if it never happened i swear i will end it it was hard not to laugh i think not now the lad looked lost my lord you heard me my father told you to obey my sister very well obey her stay close to her side keep her trust pleasure her as often as she requires it no one need ever know so long as you keep faith with me i want to know what cersei is doing where she goes who she sees what they talk of what plans she is hatching all and you will be the one to tell me wont you yes my lord lancel spoke without a moments hesitation tyrion liked that i will i swear it as you command page rise tyrion filled the second cup and pressed it on him drink to our understanding i promise there are no boars in the castle that i know of lancel lifted the cup and drank albeit stiffly smile cousin my sister is a beautiful woman and its all for the good of the realm you could do well out of this knighthood is nothing if youre clever youll have a lordship from me before youre done tyrion swirled the wine in his cup we want cersei to have every faith in you go back and tell her i beg her forgiveness tell her that you frightened me that i want no conflict between us that henceforth i shall do nothing without her consent but her demands oh ill give her pycelle you will lancel seemed astonished tyrion smiled ill release him on the morrow i could swear that i hadnt harmed a hair on his head but it wouldnt be strictly true in any case hes well enough though i wont vouch for his vigor the black cells are not a healthy place for a man his age cersei can keep him as a pet or send him to the wall i dont care which but i wont have him on the council and ser jacelyn tell my sister you believe you can win him away from me given time that ought to content her for a while as you say lancel finished his wine one last thing with king robert dead it would be most embarrassing should his grieving widow suddenly grow great with child my lord i we the queen has commanded me not to his ears had turned lannister crimson i spill my seed on her belly my lord a lovely belly i have no doubt moisten it as often as you wish but see that your dew falls nowhere else i want no more nephews is that clear ser lancel made a stiff bow and took his leave tyrion allowed himself a moment to feel sorry for the boy another fool and a weakling as well but he does not deserve what cersei and i are doing to him it was a kindness that his uncle kevan had two other sons this one was unlikely to live out the year cersei would have him killed out of hand if she learned he was betraying her and if by some grace of the gods she did not lancel would never survive the day jaime lannister returned to kings landing the only question would be whether jaime cut him down in a jealous rage or cersei murdered him first to keep jaime from finding out tyrions silver was on cersei a restlessness was on him and tyrion knew full well he would not get back to sleep tonight not here in any case he found podrick payne asleep in a chair outside the door of the solar and shook him by the shoulder summon bronn and then run down to the stables and have two horses saddled the squires eyes were cloudy with sleep horses those big brown animals that love apples im sure youve seen them four legs and a tail but bronn page first the sellsword was not long in appearing who pissed in your soup he demanded cersei as ever youd think id be used to the taste by now but never mind my gentle sister seems to have mistaken me for ned stark i hear he was taller not after joff took off his head you ought to have dressed more warmly the night is chill are we going somewhere are all sellswords as clever as you the city streets were dangerous but with bronn beside him tyrion felt safe enough the guards let him out a postern gate in the north wall and they rode down shadowblack lane to the foot of aegons high hill and thence onto pigrun alley past rows of shuttered windows and tall timberandstone buildings whose upper stories leaned out so far over the street they almost kissed the moon seemed to follow them as they went playing peekandsneak among the chimneys they encountered no one but a lone old crone carrying a dead cat by the tail she gave them a fearful look as if she were afraid they might try to steal her dinner and slunk off into the shadows without a word tyrion reflected on the men who had been hand before him who had proved no match for his sisters wiles how could they be men like that too honest to live too noble to shit cersei devours such fools every morning when she breaks her fast the only way to defeat my sister is to play her own game and that was something the lords stark and arryn would never do small wonder that both of them were dead while tyrion lannister had never felt more alive his stunted legs might make him a comic grotesque at a harvest ball but this dance he knew despite the hour the brothel was crowded chataya greeted them pleasantly and escorted them to the common room bronn went upstairs with a darkeyed girl from dorne but alayaya was busy entertaining she will be so pleased to know youve come said chataya i will see that the turret room is made ready for you will my lord take a cup of wine while he waits i will he said the wine was poor stuff compared to the vintages from the arbor the house normally served you must forgive us my lord chataya said i cannot find good wine at any price of late you are not alone in that i fear chataya commiserated with him a moment then excused herself and glided off a handsome woman tyrion reflected as he watched her go he had seldom seen such elegance and dignity in a whore though to be sure she saw herself more as a kind of priestess perhaps that is the secret it is not what we do so much as why we do it somehow that thought comforted him a few of the other patrons were giving him sideways looks the last time he ventured out a man had spit on him well had tried to instead hed spit on bronn and in future would do his spitting without page teeth is milord feeling unlove dancy slid into his lap and nibbled at his ear i have a cure for that smiling tyrion shook his head you are too beautiful for words sweetling but ive grown fond of alayayas remedy youve never tried mine milord never chooses anyone but yaya shes good but im better dont you want to see next time perhaps tyrion had no doubt that dancy would be a lively handful she was pugnosed and bouncy with freckles and a mane of thick red hair that tumbled down past her waist but he had shae waiting for him at the manse giggling she put her hand between his thighs and squeezed him through his breeches i dont think he wants to wait till next time she announced he wants to come out and count all my freckles i think dancy alayaya stood in the doorway dark and cool in gauzy green silk his lordship is come to visit me tyrion gently disentangled himself from the other girl and stood dancy did not seem to mind next time she reminded him she put a finger in her mouth and sucked it as the blackskinned girl led him up the stairs she said poor dancy she has a fortnight to get my lord to choose her elsewise she loses her black pearls to marei marei was a cool pale delicate girl tyrion had noticed once or twice green eyes and porcelain skin long straight silvery hair very lovely but too solemn by half id hate to have the poor child lose her pearls on account of me then take her upstairs next time maybe i will she smiled i think not my lord shes right tyrion thought i wont shae may be only a whore but i am faithful to her after my fashion in the turret room as he opened the door of the wardrobe he looked at alayaya curiously what do you do while im gone she raised her arms and stretched like some sleek black cat sleep i am much better rested since you began to visit us my lord and marei is teaching us to read perhaps soon i will be able to pass the time with a book sleep is good he said and books are better he gave her a quick kiss on the cheek then it was down the shaft and through the tunnel as he left the stable on his piebald gelding tyrion heard the sound of music drifting over the rooftops it page was pleasant to think that men still sang even in the midst of butchery and famine remembered notes filled his head and for a moment he could almost hear tysha as shed sung to him half a lifetime ago he reined up to listen the tune was wrong the words too faint to hear a different song then and why not his sweet innocent tysha had been a lie start to finish only a whore his brother jaime had hired to make him a man im free of tysha now he thought shes haunted me half my life but i dont need her anymore no more than i need alayaya or dancy or marei or the hundreds like them ive bedded with over the years i have shae now shae the gates of the manse were closed and barred tyrion pounded until the ornate bronze eye clacked open its me the man who admitted him was one of varyss prettier finds a braavosi daggerman with a harelip and a lazy eye tyrion had wanted no handsome young guardsmen loitering about shae day after day find me old ugly scarred men preferably impotent he had told the eunuch men who prefer boys or men who prefer sheep for that matter varys had not managed to come up with any sheeplovers but he did find a eunuch strangler and a pair of foulsmelling ibbenese who were as fond of axes as they were of each other the others were as choice a lot of mercenaries as ever graced a dungeon each uglier than the last when varys had paraded them before him tyrion had been afraid hed gone too far but shae had never uttered a word of complaint and why would she she has never complained of me and im more hideous than all her guards together perhaps she does not even see ugliness even so tyrion would sooner have used some of his mountain clansmen to guard the manse chellas black ears perhaps or the moon brothers he had more faith in their iron loyalties and sense of honor than in the greed of sellswords the risk was too great however all kings landing knew the wildlings were his if he sent the black ears here it would only be a matter of time until the whole city knew the kings hand was keeping a concubine one of the ibbenese took his horse have you woken her tyrion asked him no mlord good the fire in the bedchamber had burned down to embers but the room was still warm shae had kicked off her blankets and sheets as she slept she lay nude atop the featherbed the soft curves of her young body limned in the faint glow from the hearth tyrion stood in the door and drank in the sight of her younger than marei sweeter than dancy more beautiful than alayaya shes all i need and more how could a whore look so clean and sweet and innocent he wondered he had not intended to disturb her but the sight of her was enough to make him hard he let his garments fall to the floor then crawled onto the bed and gently pushed her legs apart and kissed her between the thighs shae murmured in her sleep he kissed her again and licked at her secret sweetness on and on until his beard and her cunt were both soaked when she gave a soft moan and shuddered he climbed up and thrust himself inside her and exploded almost at once her eyes were open she smiled and stroked his head and whispered i just had the sweetest dream mlord tyrion nipped at her small hard nipple and nestled his head on her shoulder he did not pull out of her would that he never had to pull out of her this is no dream he promised her it is real all of it he page thought the wars the intrigues the great bloody game and me in the center of it me the dwarf the monster the one they scorned and laughed at but now i hold it all the power the city the girl this was what i was made for and gods forgive me but i do love it and her and her chapter arya whatever names harren the black had meant to give his towers were long forgotten they were called the tower of dread the widows tower the wailing tower the tower of ghosts and kingspyre tower arya slept in a shallow niche in the cavernous vaults beneath the wailing tower on a bed of straw she had water to wash in whenever she liked a chunk of soap the work was hard but no harder than walking miles every day weasel did not need to find worms and bugs to eat as arry had there was bread every day and barley stews with bits of carrot and turnip and once a fortnight even a bite of meat hot pie ate even better he was where he belonged in the kitchens a round stone building with a domed roof that was a world unto itself arya took her meals at a trestle table in the undercroft with weese and his other charges but sometimes she would be chosen to help fetch their food and she and hot pie could steal a moment to talk he could never remember that she was now weasel and kept calling her arry even though he knew she was a girl once he tried to slip her a hot apple tart but he made such a clumsy job of it that two of the cooks saw they took the tart away and beat him with a big wooden spoon gendry had been sent to the forge arya seldom saw him as for those she served with she did not even want to know their names that only made it hurt worse when they died most of them were older than she was and content to let her alone harrenhal was vast much of it far gone in decay lady whent had held the castle as bannerman to house tully but shed used only the lower thirds of two of the five towers and let the rest go to ruin now she was fled and the small household shed left could not begin to tend the needs of all the knights lords and highborn prisoners lord tywin had brought so the lannisters must forage for servants as well as for plunder and provender the talk was that lord tywin planned to restore harrenhal to glory and make it his new seat once the war was done weese used arya to run messages draw water and fetch food and sometimes to serve at table in the barracks hall above the armory where the menatarms took their meals but most of her work was cleaning the ground floor of the wailing tower was given over to storerooms and granaries and two floors above housed part of the garrison but the upper stories had not been occupied for eighty years now lord tywin had commanded that they be made fit for habitation again there were floors to be scrubbed grime to be washed off windows broken chairs and rotted beds to be carried off the topmost story was infested with nests of the huge black bats that house whent had used for its sigil and there were rats in the cellars as well and ghosts some said the spirits of harren the black and his sons page arya thought that was stupid harren and his sons had died in kingspyre tower that was why it had that name so why should they cross the yard to haunt her the wailing tower only wailed when the wind blew from the north and that was just the sound the air made blowing through the cracks in the stones where they had fissured from the heat if there were ghosts in harrenhal they never troubled her it was the living men she feared weese and ser gregor clegane and lord tywin lannister himself who kept his apartments in kingspyre tower still the tallest and mightiest of all though lopsided beneath the weight of the slagged stone that made it look like some giant halfmelted black candle she wondered what lord tywin would do if she marched up to him and confessed to being arya stark but she knew shed never get near enough to talk to him and anyhow hed never believe her if she did and afterward weese would beat her bloody in his own small strutting way weese was nearly as scary as ser gregor the mountain swatted men like flies but most of the time he did not even seem to know the fly was there weese always knew you were there and what you were doing and sometimes what you were thinking he would hit at the slightest provocation and he had a dog who was near as bad as he was an ugly spotted bitch that smelled worse than any dog arya had ever known once she saw him set the dog on a latrine boy whod annoyed him she tore a big chunk out of the boys calf while weese laughed it took him only three days to earn the place of honor in her nightly prayers weese she would whisper first of all dunsen chiswyck polliver raff the sweetling the tickler and the hound ser gregor ser amory ser ilyn ser meryn king joffrey queen cersei if she let herself forget even one of them how would she ever find him again to kill him on the road arya had felt like a sheep but harrenbal turned her into a mouse she was grey as a mouse in her scratchy wool shift and like a mouse she kept to the crannies and crevices and dark holes of the castle scurrying out of the way of the mighty sometimes she thought they were all mice within those thick walls even the knights and the great lords the size of the castle made even gregor clegane seem small harrenhal covered thrice as much ground as winterfell and its buildings were so much larger they could scarcely be compared its stables housed a thousand horses its godswood covered twenty acres its kitchens were as large as winterfells great hall and its own great hall grandly named the hall of a hundred hearths even though it only had thirty and some arya had tried to count them twice but she came up with thirtythree once and thirtyfive the other time was so cavernous that lord tywin could have feasted his entire host though he never did walls doors halls steps everything was built to an inhuman scale that made arya remember the stories old nan used to tell of the giants who lived beyond the wall and as lords and ladies never notice the little grey mice under their feet arya heard all sorts of secrets just by keeping her ears open as she went about her duties pretty pia from the buttery was a slut who was working her way through every knight in the castle the wife of the gaoler was with child but the real father was either ser alyn stackspear or a singer called whitesmile wat lord lefford made mock of ghosts at table but always kept a candle burning by his bed ser dunavers squire jodge could not hold his water when he slept the cooks despised ser harys swyft and spit in all his food once she even overheard maester tothmures serving girl confiding to her brother about some message that said joffrey was a bastard and not the rightful king at all lord tywin told him to burn the letter and never speak such filth again the girl whispered king roberts brothers stannis and renly had joined the fighting she heard and both of them kings now weese said realms got more kings than a castles got rats even lannister men questioned how long joffrey would hold the iron throne the lads got no army but them gold cloaks and hes ruled by page a eunuch a dwarf and a woman she heard a lordling mutter in his cups what good will the likes of them be if it comes to battle there was always talk of beric dondarrion a fat archer once said the bloody mummers had slain him but the others only laughed lorch killed the man at rushing falls and the mountains slain him twice got me a silver stag says he dont stay dead this time neither arya did not know who bloody mummers were until a fortnight later when the queerest company of men shed ever seen arrived at harrenhal beneath the standard of a black goat with bloody horns rode copper men with bells in their braids lancers astride striped blackandwhite horses bowmen with powdered cheeks squat hairy men with shaggy shields brownskinned men in feathered cloaks a wispy fool in greenandpink motley swordsmen with fantastic forked beards dyed green and purple and silver spearmen with colored scars that covered their cheeks a slender man in septons robes a fatherly one in maesters grey and a sickly one whose leather cloak was fringed with long blond hair at their head was a man stickthin and very tall with a drawn emaciated face made even longer by the ropy black beard that grew from his pointed chin nearly to his waist the helm that hung from his saddle horn was black steel fashioned in the shape of a goats head about his neck he wore a chain made of linked coins of many different sizes shapes and metals and his horse was one of the strange blackandwhite ones you dont want to know that lot weasel weese said when he saw her looking at the goathelmed man two of his drinking friends were with him menatarms in service to lord lefford who are they she asked one of the soldiers laughed the footmen girl toes of the goat lord tywins bloody mummers pease for wits you get her flayed you can scrub the bloody steps said weese theyre sellswords weasel girl call themselves the brave companions dont use them other names where they can hear or theyll hurt you bad the goathelms their captain lord vargo hoat hes no fucking lord said the second soldier i heard ser amory say so hes just some sellsword with a mouth full of slobber and a high opinion of hisself aye said weese but she better call him lord if she wants to keep all her parts arya looked at vargo hoat again how many monsters does lord win have the brave companions were housed in the widows tower so arya need not serve them she was glad of that on the very night they arrived fighting broke out between the sellswords and some lannister men ser harys swyfts squire was stabbed to death and two of the bloody mummers were wounded the next morning lord tywin hanged them both from the gatehouse walls along with one of lord lyddens archers weese said the archer had started all the trouble by taunting the sellswords over beric dondarrion after the hanged men had stopped kicking vargo hoat and ser harys embraced and kissed and swore to love each other always as lord tywin looked on arya thought it was funny the way vargo hoat lisped and slobbered but she knew better than to laugh the bloody mummers did not linger long at harrenhal but before they rode out again arya heard one of them saying how a northern army under roose bolton had occupied the ruby ford of the trident if page he crosses lord tywin will smash him again like he did on the green fork a lannister bowmen said but his fellows jeered him down boltonll never cross not till the young wolf marches from riverrun with his wild northmen and all them wolves arya had not known her brother was so near riverrun was much closer than winterfell though she was not certain where it lay in relation to harrenhal i could find out somehow i know i could if only i could get away when she thought of seeing robbs face again arya had to bite her lip and i want to see ion too and bran and rickon and mother even sansa ill kiss her and beg her pardons like a proper lady shell like that from the courtyard talk shed learned that the upper chambers of the tower of dread housed three dozen captives taken during some battle on the green fork of the trident most had been given freedom of the castle in return for their pledge not to attempt escape they vowed not to escape arya told herself but they never swore not to help me escape the captives ate at their own table in the hall of a hundred hearths and could often be seen about the grounds four brothers took their exercise together every day fighting with staves and wooden shields in the flowstone yard three of them were freys of the crossing the fourth their bastard brother they were only there a short time though one morning two other brothers arrived under a peace banner with a chest of gold and ransomed them from the knights whod captured them the six freys all left together no one ransomed the northmen though one fat lordling haunted the kitchens hot pie told her always looking for a morsel his mustache was so bushy that it covered his mouth and the clasp that held his cloak was a silverandsapphire trident he belonged to lord tywin but the fierce bearded young man who liked to walk the battlements alone in a black cloak patterned with white suns had been taken by some hedge knight who meant to get rich off him sansa would have known who he was and the fat one too but arya had never taken much interest in titles and sigils whenever septa mordane had gone on about the history of this house and that house she was inclined to drift and dream and wonder when the lesson would be done she did remember lord cerwyn though his lands had been close to winterfell so he and his son cley had often visited yet as fate would have it he was the only captive who was never seen he was abed in a tower cell recovering from a wound for days and days arya tried to work out how she might steal past the door guards to see him if he knew her he would be honor bound to help her a lord would have gold for a certainty they all did perhaps he would pay some of lord tywins own sellswords to take her to riverrun father had always said that most sellswords would betray anyone for enough gold then one morning she spied three women in the cowled grey robes of the silent sisters loading a corpse into their wagon the body was sewn into a cloak of the finest silk decorated with a battleaxe sigil when arya asked who it was one of the guards told her that lord cerwyn had died the words felt like a kick in the belly he could never have helped you anyway she thought as the sisters drove the wagon through the gate he couldnt even help himself you stupid mouse after that it was back to scrubbing and scurrying and listening at doors lord tywin would soon march on riverrun she heard or he would drive south to highgarden no one would ever expect that no he must defend kings landing stannis was the greatest threat hed sent gregor clegane and vargo hoat to destroy roose bolton and remove the dagger from his back hed sent ravens to the eyrie he meant to wed the lady lysa arryn and win the vale hed bought a ton of silver to forge magic swords that would slay the stark wargs he was writing lady stark to make a peace the kingslayer would soon be freed page though ravens came and went every day lord tywin himself spent most of his days behind closed doors with his war council arya caught glimpses of him but always from afaronce walking the walls in the company of three maesters and the fat captive with the bushy mustache once riding out with his lords bannermen to visit the encampments but most often standing in an arch of the covered gallery watching men at practice in the yard below he stood with his hands locked together on the gold pommel of his longsword they said lord tywin loved gold most of all he even shit gold she heard one squire jest the lannister lord was stronglooking for an old man with stiff golden whiskers and a bald head there was something in his face that reminded arya of her own father even though they looked nothing alike he has a lords face thats all she told herself she remembered hearing her lady mother tell father to put on his lords face and go deal with some matter father had laughed at that she could not imagine lord tywin ever laughing at anything one afternoon while she was waiting her turn to draw a pail of water from the well she heard the hinges of the east gate groaning a party of men rode under the portcullis at a walk when she spied the manticore crawling across the shield of their leader a stab of hate shot through her in the light of day ser amory lorch looked less frightening than he had by torchlight but he still had the pigs eyes she recalled one of the women said that his men had ridden all the way around the lake chasing beric dondarrion and slaying rebels we werent rebels arya thought we were the nights watch the nights watch takes no side ser amory had fewer men than she remembered though and many wounded i hope their wounds fester i hope they all die then she saw the three near the end of the column rorge had donned a black halffielm with a broad iron nasal that made it hard to see that he did not have a nose biter rode ponderously beside him on a destrier that looked ready to collapse under his weight halfhealed burns covered his body making him even more hideous than before but jaqen hghar still smiled his garb was still ragged and filthy but he had found time to wash and brush his hair it streamed down across his shoulders red and white and shiny and arya heard the girls giggling to each other in admiration i should have let the fire have them gendry said to i should have listened if she hadnt thrown them that axe theyd all be dead for a moment she was afraid but they rode past her without a flicker of interest only jaqen hghar so much as glanced in her direction and his eyes passed right over her he does not know me she thought arry was a fierce little boy with a sword and im just a grey mouse girl with a pail she spent the rest of that day scrubbing steps inside the wailing tower by evenfall her hands were raw and bleeding and her arms so sore they trembled when she lugged the pail back to the cellar too tired even for food arya begged weeses pardons and crawled into her straw to sleep weese she yawned dunsen chiswyck polliver raff the sweetling the tickler and the hound ser gregor ser amory ser ilyn ser meryn king joffrey queen cersei she thought she might add three more names to her prayer but she was too tired to decide tonight arya was dreaming of wolves running wild through the wood when a strong hand clamped down over her mouth like smooth warm stone solid and unyielding she woke at once squirming and struggling a girl says nothing a voice whispered close behind her ear a girl keeps her lips closed no one hears and friends may talk in secret yes page heart pounding arya managed the tiniest of nods jaqen hghar took his hand away the cellar was black as pitch and she could not see his face even inches away she could smell him though his skin smelled clean and soapy and he had scented his hair a boy becomes a girl he murmured i was always a girl i didnt think you saw me a man sees a man knows she remembered that she hated him you scared me youre one of them now i should have let you burn what are you doing here go away or ill yell for weese a man pays his debts a man owes three three the red god has his due sweet girl and only death may pay for life this girl took three that were his this girl must give three in their places speak the names and a man will do the rest he wants to help me arya realized with a rush of hope that made her dizzy take me to riverrun its not far if we stole some horses we could he laid a finger on her lips three lives you shall have of me no more no less three and we are done so a girl must ponder he kissed her hair softly but not too long by the time arya lit her stub of a candle only a faint smell remained of him a whiff of ginger and cloves lingering in the air the woman in the next niche rolled over on her straw and complained of the light so arya blew it out when she closed her eyes she saw faces swimming before her joffrey and his mother ilyn payne and meryn trant and sandor clegane but they were in kings landing hundreds of miles away and ser gregor had lingered only a few nights before departing again for more foraging taking raff and chiswyck and the tickler with him ser amory lorch was here though and she hated him almost as much didnt she she wasnt certain and there was always weese she thought of him again the next morning when lack of sleep made her yawn weasel weese purred next time i see that mouth droop open ill pull out your tongue and feed it to my bitch he twisted her ear between his fingers to make certain shed heard and told her to get back to those steps he wanted them clean down to the third landing by nightfall as she worked arya thought about the people she wanted dead she pretended she could see their faces on the steps and scrubbed harder to wipe them away the starks were at war with the lannisters and she was a stark so she should kill as many lannisters as she could that was what you did in wars but she didnt think she should trust jaqen i should kill them myself whenever her father had condemned a man to death he did the deed himself with ice his greatsword if you would take a mans life you owe it to him to look him in the face and hear his last words shed heard him tell robb and jon once the next day she avoided jaqen hghar and the day after that it was not hard she was very small and harrenhal was very large full of places where a mouse could hide page and then ser gregor returned earlier than expected driving a herd of goats this time in place of a herd of prisoners she heard hed lost four men in one of lord berics night raids but those arya hated returned unscathed and took up residence on the second floor of the wailing tower weese saw that they were well supplied with drink they always have a good thirst that lot he grumbled weasel go up and ask if theyve got any clothes that need mending ill have the women see to it arya ran up her wellscrubbed steps no one paid her any mind when she entered chiswyck was seated by the fire with a horn of ale to hand telling one of his funny stories she dared not interrupt unless she wanted a bloody lip after the hands tourney it were before the war come chiswyck was saying we were on our ways back west seven of us with ser gregor raff was with me and young joss stilwood hed squired for ser in the lists well we come on this pisswater river running high on account thered been rains no way to ford but theres an alehouse near so there we repair ser rousts the brewer and tells him to keep our horns full till the waters fall and you should see the mans pig eyes shine at the sight o silver so hes fetching us ale him and his daughter and poor thin stuff it is no moren brown piss which dont make me any happier nor ser neither and all the time this brewers saying how glad he is to have us custom being slow on account o them rains the fool wont shut his yap not him though ser is saying not a word just brooding on the knight o pansies and that buggers trick he played you can see how tight his mouth sits so me and the other lads we know bettern to say a squeak to him but this brewer hes got to talk he even asks how mlord fared in the jousting ser just gave him this look chiswyck cackled quaffed his ale and wiped the foam away with the back of his hand meanwhile this daughter of his has been fetching and pouring a fat little thing eighteen or so thirteen more like raff the sweetling drawled well be that as it may shes not much to look at but eggons been drinking and gets to touching her and might be i did a little touching meself and raffs telling young stilwood that he ought t drag the girl upstairs and make hisself a man giving the lad courage as it were finally joss reaches up under her skirt and she shrieks and drops her flagon and goes running off to the kitchen well it would have ended right there only what does the old fool do but he goes to ser and asks him to make us leave the girl alone him being an anointed knight and all such ser gregor he wasnt paying no mind to none of our fun but now he looks you know how he does and he commands that the girl be brought before him now the old man has to drag her out of the kitchen and no one to blame but hisself ser looks her over and says so this is the whore youre so concerned for and this besotted old fool says my laynas no whore ser right to gregors face ser he never blinks just says she is now tosses the old man another silver rips the dress off the wench and takes her right there on the table in front of her da her flopping and wiggling like a rabbit and making these noises the look on the old mans face i laughed so hard ale was coming out me nose then this boy hears the noise the son i figure and comes rushing up from the cellar so raff has to stick a dirk in his belly by then sers done so he goes back to his drinking and we all have a turn tobbot you know how he is he flops her over and goes in the back way the girl was done fighting by the time i had her maybe shed decided she liked it after all though to tell the truth i wouldnt have minded a little wiggling and now heres the best bit when its all done ser tells the old man that he wants his change the girl wasnt worth a silver he says and damned if that old man didnt fetch a fistful of coppers beg mlords pardon and thank him for the custom the men all roared none louder than chiswyck himself who laughed so hard at his own story that snot page dribbled from his nose down into his scraggy grey beard arya stood in the shadows of the stairwell and watched him she crept back down to the cellars without saying a word when weese found that she hadnt asked about the clothes he yanked down her breeches and caned her until blood ran down her thighs but arya closed her eyes and thought of all the sayings syrio had taught her so she scarcely felt it two nights later he sent her to the barracks hall to serve at table she was carrying a flagon of wine and pouring when she glimpsed jaqen hghar at his trencher across the aisle chewing her lip arya glanced around warily to make certain weese was not in sight fear cuts deeper than swords she told herself she took a step and another and with each she felt less a mouse she worked her way down the bench filling wine cups rorge sat to jaqens right deep drunk but he took no note of her arya leaned close and whispered chiswyck right in jaqens ear the lorathi gave no sign that he had heard when her flagon was empty arya hurried down to the cellars to refill it from the cask and quickly returned to her pouring no one had died of thirst while she was gone nor even noted her brief absence nothing happened the next day nor the day after but on the third day arya went to the kitchens with weese to fetch their dinner one of the mountains men fell off a wallwalk last night and broke his fool neck she heard weese tell a cook drunk the woman asked no moren usual some are saying it was harrens ghost flung him down he snorted to show what he thought of such notions it wasnt harren arya wanted to say it was me she had killed chiswyck with a whisper and she would kill two more before she was through im the ghost in harrenhal she thought and that night there was one less name to hate chapter catelyn the meeting place was a grassy sward dotted with pale grey mushrooms and the raw stumps of felled trees we are the first my lady hallis mollen said as they reined up amidst the stumps alone between the armies the direwolf banner of house stark flapped and fluttered atop the lance he bore catelyn could not see the sea from here but she could feel how close it was the smell of salt was heavy on the wind gusting from the east stannis baratheons foragers had cut the trees down for his siege towers and catapults catelyn wondered how long the grove had stood and whether ned had rested here when he led his host south to lift the last siege of storms end he had won a great victory that day all the greater for being bloodless page gods grant that i shall do the same catelyn prayed her own liege men thought she was mad even to come this is no fight of ours my lady ser wendel manderly had said i know the king would not wish his mother to put herself at risk we are all at risk she told him perhaps too sharply do you think i wish to be here ser i belong at riverrun with my dying father at winterfell with my sons robb sent me south to speak for him and speak for him i shall it would be no easy thing to forge a peace between these brothers catelyn knew yet for the good of the realm it must be tried across rainsodden flelds and stony ridges she could see the great castle of storms end rearing up against the sky its back to the unseen sea beneath that mass of pale grey stone the encircling army of lord stannis baratheon looked as small and insignificant as mice with banners the songs said that storms end had been raised in ancient days by durran the first storm king who had won the love of the fair elenei daughter of the sea god and the goddess of the wind on the night of their wedding elenei had yielded her maidenhood to a mortals love and thus doomed herself to a mortals death and her grieving parents had unleashed their wrath and sent the winds and waters to batter down durrans hold his friends and brothers and wedding guests were crushed beneath collapsing walls or blown out to sea but elenei sheltered durran within her arms so he took no harm and when the dawn came at last he declared war upon the gods and vowed to rebuild five more castles he built each larger and stronger than the last only to see them smashed asunder when the gale winds came howling up shipbreaker bay driving great walls of water before them his lords pleaded with him to build inland his priests told him he must placate the gods by giving elenei back to the sea even his smallfolk begged him to relent durran would have none of it a seventh castle he raised most massive of all some said the children of the forest helped him build it shaping the stones with magic others claimed that a small boy told him what he must do a boy who would grow to be bran the builder no matter how the tale was told the end was the same though the angry gods threw storm after storm against it the seventh castle stood defiant and durran godsgrief and fair elenei dwelt there together until the end of their days gods do not forget and still the gales came raging up the narrow sea yet storms end endured through centuries and tens of centuries a castle like no other its great curtain wall was a hundred feet high unbroken by arrow slit or postern everywhere rounded curving smooth its stones fit so cunningly together that nowhere was crevice nor angle nor gap by which the wind might enter that wall was said to be forty feet thick at its narrowest and near eighty on the seaward face a double course of stones with an inner core of sand and rubble within that mighty bulwark the kitchens and stables and yards sheltered safe from wind and wave of towers there was but one a colossal drum tower windowless where it faced the sea so large that it was granary and barracks and feast hall and lords dwelling all in one crowned by massive battlements that made it look from afar like a spiked flst atop an upthrust arm my lady hal mollen called two riders had emerged from the tidy little camp beneath the castle and were coming toward them at a slow walk that will be king stannis no doubt catelyn watched them come stannis it must be yet that is not the baratheon banner it was a bright yellow not the rich gold of renlys standards and the device it bore was red though she could not make out its shape renly would be last to arrive he had told her as much when she set out he did not propose to mount page his horse until he saw his brother well on his way the first to arrive must wait on the other and renly would do no waiting it is a sort of game kings play she told herself well she was no king so she need not play it catelyn was practiced at waiting as he neared she saw that stannis wore a crown of red gold with points fashioned in the shape of flames his belt was studded with garnets and yellow topaz and a great squarecut ruby was set in the hilt of the sword he wore otherwise his dress was plain studded leather jerkin over quilted doublet worn boots breeches of brown roughspun the device on his sunyellow banner showed a red heart surrounded by a blaze of orange fire the crowned stag was there yes shrunken and enclosed within the heart even more curious was his standard bearera woman garbed all in reds face shadowed within the deep hood of her scarlet cloak a red priestess catelyn thought wondering the sect was numerous and powerful in the free cities and the distant east but there were few in the seven kingdoms lady stark stannis baratheon said with chill courtesy as he reined up he inclined his head balder than she remembered lord stannis she returned beneath the tighttrimmed beard his heavy jaw clenched hard yet he did not hector her about titles for that she was duly grateful i had not thought to find you at storms end i had not thought to be here his deepset eyes regarded her uncomfortably this was not a man made for easy courtesies i am sorry for your lords death he said though eddard stark was no friend to me he was never your enemy my lord when the lords tyrell and redwyne held you prisoned in that castle starving it was eddard stark who broke the siege at my brothers command not for love of me stannis answered lord eddard did his duty i will not deny it did i ever do less i should have been roberts hand that was your brothers will ned never wanted it yet he took it that which should have been mine still i give you my word you shall have justice for his murder how they loved to promise heads these men who would be king your brother promised me the same but if truth be told i would sooner have my daughters back and leave justice to the gods cersei still holds my sansa and of arya there has been no word since the day of roberts death if your children are found when i take the city they shall be sent to you alive or dead his tone implied and when shall that be lord stannis kings landing is close to your dragonstone but i find you here instead you are frank lady stark very well ill answer you frankly to take the city i need the power of these southron lords i see across the field my brother has them i must needs take them from him men give their allegiance where they will my lord these lords swore fealty to robert and house page baratheon if you and your brother were to put aside your quarrel i have no quarrel with renly should he prove dutiful i am his elder and his king i want only what is mine by rights renly owes me loyalty and obedience i mean to have it from him and from these other lords stannis studied her face and what cause brings you to this field my lady has house stark cast its lot with my brother is that the way of it this one will never bend she thought yet she must try nonetheless too much was at stake my son reigns as king in the north by the will of our lords and people he bends the knee to no man but holds out the hand of friendship to all kings have no friends stannis said bluntly only subjects and enemies and brothers a cheerful voice called out behind her catelyn glanced over her shoulder as lord renlys palfrey picked her way through the stumps the younger baratheon was splendid in his green velvet doublet and satin cloak trimmed in vair the crown of golden roses girded his temples jade stags head rising over his forehead long black hair spilling out beneath jagged chunks of black diamond studded his swordbelt and a chain of gold and emeralds looped around his neck renly had chosen a woman to carry his banner as well though brienne hid face and form behind plate armor that gave no hint of her sex atop her twelvefoot lance the crowned stag pranced blackongold as the wind off the sea rippled the cloth his brothers greeting was curt lord renly king renly can that truly be you stannis stannis frowned who else should it be renly gave an easy shrug when i saw that standard i could not be certain whose banner do you bear mine own the redclad priestess spoke up the king has taken for his sigil the fiery heart of the lord of light renly seemed amused by that all for the good if we both use the same banner the battle will be terribly confused catelyn said let us hope there will be no battle we three share a common foe who would destroy us all stannis studied her unsmiling the iron throne is mine by rights all those who deny that are my foes the whole of the realm denies it brother said renly old men deny it with their death rattle and unborn children deny it in their motherswombs they deny it in dorne and they deny it on the wall no one wants you for their king sorry stannis clenched his jaw his face taut i swore i would never treat with you while you wore your traitors crown would that i had kept to that vow page this is folly catelyn said sharply lord tywin sits at harrenhal with twenty thousand swords the remnants of the kingslayers army have regrouped at the golden tooth another lannister host gathers beneath the shadow of casterly rock and cersei and her son hold kings landing and your precious iron throne you each name yourself king yet the kingdom bleeds and no one lifts a sword to defend it but my son renly shrugged your son has won a few battles i shall win the war the lannisters can wait my pleasure if you have proposals to make make them stannis said brusquely or i will be gone very well said renly i propose that you dismount bend your knee and swear me your allegiance stannis choked back rage that you shall never have you served robert why not me robert was my elder brother you are the younger younger bolder and far more comely and a thief and a usurper besides renly shrugged the targaryens called robert usurper he seemed to be able to bear the shame so shall i this will not do listen to yourselves if you were sons of mine i would bang your heads together and lock you in a bedchamber until you remembered that you were brothers stannis frowned at her you presume too much lady stark i am the rightful king and your son no less a traitor than my brother here his day will come as well the naked threat fanned her fury you are very free to name others traitor and usurper my lord yet how are you any different you say you alone are the rightful king yet it seems to me that robert had two sons by all the laws of the seven kingdoms prince joffrey is his rightful heir and tornmen after him and we are all traitors however good our reasons renly laughed you must forgive lady catelyn stannis shes come all the way down from riverrun a long way ahorse i fear she never saw your little letter joffrey is not my brothers seed stannis said bluntly nor is tommen they are bastards the girl as well all three of them abominations born of incest would even cersei be so mad catelyn was speechless isnt that a sweet story my lady renly asked i was camped at horn hill when lord tarly received his letter and i must say it took my breath away he smiled at his brother i had never suspected you were so clever stannis were it only true you would indeed be roberts heir were it true do you name me a liar page can you prove any word of this fable stannis ground his teeth robert could never have known catelyn thought or cersei would have lost her head in an instant lord stannis she asked if you knew the queen to be guilty of such monstrous crimes why did you keep silent i did not keep silent stannis declared i brought my suspicions to jon arryn rather than your own brother my brothers regard for me was never more than dutiful said stannis from me such accusations would have seemed peevish and selfserving a means of placing myself first in the line of succession i believed robert would be more disposed to listen if the charges came from lord arryn whom he loved ah said renly so we have the word of a dead man do you think he died by happenstance you purblind fool cersei had him poisoned for fear he would reveal her lord jon had been gathering certain proofs which doubtless died with him how inconvenient catelyn was remembering fitting pieces together my sister lysa accused the queen of killing her husband in a letter she sent me at winterfell she admitted later in the eyrie she laid the murder at the feet of the queens brother tyrion stannis snorted if you step in a nest of snakes does it matter which one bites you first all this of snakes and incest is droll but it changes nothing you may well have the better claim stannis but i still have the larger army renlys hand slid inside his cloak stannis saw and reached at once for the hilt of his sword but before he could draw steel his brother produced a peach would you like one brother renly asked smiling from highgarden youve never tasted anything so sweet i promise you he took a bite juice ran from the corner of his mouth i did not come here to eat fruit stannis was fuming my lords catelyn said we ought to be hammering out the terms of an alliance not trading taunts a man should never refuse to taste a peach renly said as he tossed the stone away he may never get the chance again life is short stannis remember what the starks say winter is coming he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand i did not come here to be threatened either nor were you renly snapped back when i make threats youll know it if truth be told ive never liked you stannis but you are my own blood and i have no wish to slay you so if it is storms end you want take it as a brothers gift as robert once gave it to me i give it to you page it is not yours to give it is mine by rights sighing renly half turned in the saddle what am i to do with this brother of mine brienne he refuses my peach he refuses my castle he even shunned my wedding we both know your wedding was a mummers farce a year ago you were scheming to make the girl one of roberts whores a year ago i was scheming to make the girl roberts queen renly said but what does it matter the boar got robert and i got margaery youll be pleased to know she came to me a maid in your bed shes like to die that way h i expect ill get a son on her within the year pray how many sons do you have stannis oh yesnone renly smiled innocently as to your daughter i understand if my wife looked like yours id send my fool to service her as well enough stannis roared i will not be mocked to my face do you hear me i will not he yanked his longsword from its scabbard the steel gleamed strangely bright in the wan sunlight now red now yellow now blazing white the air around it seemed to shimmer as if from heat catelyns horse whinnied and backed away a step but brienne moved between the brothers her own blade in hand put up your steel she shouted at stannis cersei lannister is laughing herself breathless catelyn thought wearily stannis pointed his shining sword at his brother i am not without mercy thundered he who was notoriously without mercy nor do i wish to sully lightbringer with a brothers blood for the sake of the mother who bore us both i will give you this night to rethink your folly renly strike your banners and come to me before dawn and i will grant you storms end and your old seat on the council and even name you my heir until a son is born to me otherwise i shall destroy you renly laughed stannis thats a very pretty sword ill grant you but i think the glow off it has ruined your eyes look across the fields brother can you see all those banners do you think a few bolts of cloth will make you king tyrell swords will make me king rowan and tarly and caron will make me king with axe and mace and warhammer tarth arrows and penrose lances fossoway cuy mullendore estermont selmy hightower oakheart crane caswell blackbar morrigen beesbury shermer dunn footly even house florent your own wifes brothers and uncles they will make me king all the chivalry of the south rides with me and that is the least part of my power my foot is coming behind a hundred thousand swords and spears and pikes and you will destroy me with what pray that paltry rabble i see there huddled under the castle walls ill call them five thousand and be generous codfish lords and onion knights and sellswords half of them are like to come over to me before the battle starts you have fewer than four hundred horse my scouts tell mefreeriders in boiled leather who will not stand an instant against armored lances i do not care how seasoned a warrior you think you are stannis that host of yours wont survive the first charge of my vanguard page we shall see brother some of the light seemed to go out of the world when stannis slid his sword back into its scabbard come the dawn we shall see i hope your new gods a merciful one brother stannis snorted and galloped away disdainful the red priestess lingered a moment behind look to your own sins lord renly she said as she wheeled her horse around catelyn and lord renly returned together to the camp where his thousands and her few waited their return that was amusing if not terribly profitable he commented i wonder where i can get a sword like that well doubtless loras will make me a gift of it after the battle it grieves me that it must come to this you have a cheerful way of grieving said catelyn whose distress was not feigned do i renly shrugged so be it stannis was never the most cherished of brothers i confess do you suppose this tale of his is true if joffrey is the kingslayers get your brother is the lawful heir while he lives renly admitted though its a fools law wouldnt you agree why the oldest son and not the bestfitted the crown will suit me as it never suited robert and would not suit stannis i have it in me to be a great king strong yet generous clever just diligent loyal to my friends and terrible to my enemies yet capable of forgiveness patient humble catelyn supplied renly laughed you must allow a king some flaws my lady catelyn felt very tired it had all been for nothing the baratheon brothers would drown each other in blood while her son faced the lannisters alone and nothing she could say or do would stop it it is past time i went back to riverrun to close my fathers eyes she thought that much at least i can do i may be a poor envoy but i am a good moumer gods save me their camp was well sited atop a low stony ridge that ran from north to south it was far more orderly than the sprawling encampment on the mander though only a quarter as large when hed learned of his brothers assault on storms end renly had split his forces much as robb had done at the twins his great mass of foot he had left behind at bitterbridge with his young queen his wagons carts draft animals and all his cumbersome siege machinery while renly himself led his knights and freeriders in a swift dash east how like his brother robert he was even in that only robert had always had eddard stark to temper his boldness with caution ned would surely have prevailed upon robert to bring up his whole force to encircle stannis and besiege the besiegers that choice renly had denied himself in his headlong rush to come to grips with his brother he had outdistanced his supply lines left food and forage days behind with all his wagons and mules and oxen he must come to battle soon or starve catelyn sent hal mollen to tend to their horses while she accompanied renly back to the royal pavilion at the heart of the encampment inside the walls of green silk his captains and lords bannermen were waiting to hear word of the parley my brother has not changed their young king told them as brienne page unfastened his cloak and lifted the goldandjade crown from his brow castles and courtesies will not appease him he must have blood well i am of a mind to grant his wish your grace i see no need for battle here lord mathis rowan put in the castle is strongly garrisoned and well provisioned ser cortnay penrose is a seasoned commander and the trebuchet has not been built that could breach the walls of storms end let lord stannis have his siege he will find no joy in it and whilst he sits cold and hungry and profitless we will take kings landing and have men say i feared to face stannis only fools will say that lord mathis argued renly looked to the others what say you all i say that stannis is a danger to you lord randyll tarly declared leave him unblooded and he will only grow stronger while your own power is diminished by battle the lannisters will not be beaten in a day by the time you are done with them lord stannis may be as strong as you or stronger others chorused their agreement the king looked pleased we shall fight then i have failed robb as i failed ned catelyn thought my lord she announced if you are set on battle my purpose here is done i ask your leave to return to riverrun you do not have it renly seated himself on a camp chair she stiffened i had hoped to help you make a peace my lord i will not help you make a war renly gave a shrug i daresay well prevail without your fiveandtwenty my lady i do not mean for you to take part in the battle only to watch it i was at the whispering wood my lord i have seen enough butchery i came here an envoy and an envoy you shall leave renly said but wiser than you came you shall see what befalls rebels with your own eyes so your son can hear it from your own lips well keep you safe never fear he turned away to make his dispositions lord mathis you shall lead the center of my main battle bryce youll have the left the right is mine lord estermont you shall command the reserve i shall not fail you your grace lord estermont replied lord mathis rowan spoke up who shall have the van your grace said ser jon fossoway i beg the honor beg all you like said ser guyard the green by rights it should be one of the seven who strikes the first blow it takes more than a pretty cloak to charge a shield wall randyll tarly announced i was leading mace tyrells van when you were still sucking on your mothers teat guyard a clamor filled the pavilion as other men loudly set forth their claims the knights of summer catelyn thought renly raised a hand enough my lords if i had a dozen vans all of you should have one but page the greatest glory by rights belongs to the greatest knight ser loras shall strike the first blow with a glad heart your grace the knight of flowers knelt before the king grant me your blessing and a knight to ride beside me with your banner let the stag and rose go to battle side by side renly glanced about him brienne your grace she was still armored in her blue steel though she had taken off her helm the crowded tent was hot and sweat plastered limp yellow hair to her broad homely face my place is at your side i am your sworn shield one of seven the king reminded her never fear four of your fellows will be with me in the fight brienne dropped to her knees if i must part from your grace grant me the honor of arming you for battle catelyn heard someone snigger behind her she loves him poor thing she thought sadly shed play his squire just to touch him and never care how great a fool they think her granted renly said now leave me all of you even kings must rest before a battle my lord catelyn said there was a small sept in the last village we passed if you will not permit me to depart for riverrun grant me leave to go there and pray as you will ser robar give lady stark safe escort to this sept but see that she returns to us by dawn you might do well to pray yourself catelyn added for victory for wisdom renly laughed loras stay and help me pray its been so long ive quite forgotten how as to the rest of you i want every man in place by first light armed armored and horsed we shall give stannis a dawn he will not soon forget dusk was falling when catelyn left the pavilion ser robar royce fell in beside her she knew him slightlyone of bronze yohns sons comely in a roughhewn way a tourney warrior of some renown renly had gifted him with a rainbow cloak and a suit of blood red armor and named him one of his seven you are a long way from the vale ser she told him and you far from winterfell my lady i know what brought me here but why have you come this is not your battle no more than it is mine i made it my battle when i made renly my king the royces are bannermen to house arryn my lord father owes lady lysa fealty as does his heir a second son must find glory where he can page ser robar shrugged a man grows weary of tourneys he could not be older than oneandtwenty catelyn thought of an age with his king but her king her robb had more wisdom at fifteen than this youth had ever learned or so she prayed in catelyns small corner of the camp shadd was slicing carrots into a kettle hal mollen was dicing with three of his winterfell men and lucas blackwood sat sharpening his dagger lady stark lucas said when he saw her mollen says it is to be battle at dawn hal has the truth of it she answered and a loose tongue as well it would seem do we fight or flee we pray lucas she answered him we pray chapter sansa the longer you keep him waiting the worse it will go for you sandor clegane warned her sansa tried to hurry but her fingers fumbled at buttons and knots the hound was always roughtongued but something in the way he had looked at her filled her with dread had joffrey found out about her meetings with ser dontos please no she thought as she brushed out her hair ser dontos was her only hope i have to look pretty foff likes me to look pretty hes always liked me in this gown this color she smoothed the cloth down the fabric was tight across her chest when she emerged sansa walked on the hounds left away from the burned side of his face tell me what ive done not you your kingly brother robbs a traitor sansa knew the words by rote i had no part in whatever he did gods be good dont let it be the kingslayer if robb had harmed jaime larmister it would mean her life she thought of ser ilyn and how those terrible pale eyes staring pitilessly out of that gaunt pockmarked face the hound snorted they trained you well little bird he conducted her to the lower bailey where a crowd had gathered around the archery butts men moved aside to let them through she could hear lord gyles coughing loitering stablehands eyed her insolently but ser horas redwyne averted his gaze as she passed and his brother hobber pretended not to see her a yellow cat was dying on the ground mewling piteously a crossbow quarrel through its ribs sansa stepped around it feeling ill ser dontos approached on his broomstick horse since hed been too drunk to mount his destrier at the tourney the king had decreed that henceforth he must always go horsed be brave he whispered squeezing her arm page joffrey stood in the center of the throng winding an ornate crossbow ser boros and ser meryn were with him the sight of them was enough to tie her insides in knots your grace she fell to her knees kneeling wont save you now the king said stand up youre here to answer for your brothers latest treasons your grace whatever my traitor brother has done i had no part you know that i beg you please get her up the hound pulled her to her feet not ungently ser lancel joff said tell her of this outrage sansa had always thought lancel lannister comely and well spoken but there was neither pity nor kindness in the look he gave her using some vile sorcery your brother fell upon ser stafford lannister with an army of wargs not three days ride from lannisport thousands of good men were butchered as they slept without the chance to lift sword after the slaughter the northmen feasted on the flesh of the slain horror coiled cold hands around sansas throat you have nothing to say asked joffrey your grace the poor child is shocked witless murmured ser dontos silence fool joffrey lifted his crossbow and pointed it at her face you starks are as unnatural as those wolves of yours ive not forgotten how your monster savaged me that was aryas wolf she said lady never hurt you but you killed her anyway no your father did joff said but i killed your father i wish id done it myself i killed a man last night who was bigger than your father they came to the gate shouting my name and calling for bread like i was some baker but i taught them better i shot the loudest one right through the throat and he died with the ugly iron head of the quarrel staring her in the face it was hard to think what else to say of course he died he had my quarrel in his throat there was a woman throwing rocks i got her as well but only in the arm frowning he lowered the crossbow id shoot you too but if i do mother says theyd kill my uncle jaime instead youll just be punished and well send word to your brother about what will happen to you if he doesnt yield dog hit her let me beat her ser dontos shoved forward tin armor clattering he was armed with a morningstar whose head was a melon my florian she could have kissed him blotchy skin and broken veins and all he trotted his broomstick around her shouting traitor traitor and whacking her over the head with the melon sansa covered herself with her hands staggering every time the fruit pounded her her hair sticky page by the second blow people were laughing the melon flew to pieces laugh joffrey she prayed as the juice ran down her face and the front of her blue silk gown laugh and be satisfied joffrey did not so much as snigger boros meryn ser meryn trant seized dontos by the arm and flung him brusquely away the redfaced fool went sprawling broomstick melon and all ser boros seized sansa leave her face joffrey commanded i like her pretty boros slammed a fist into sansas belly driving the air out of her when she doubled over the knight grabbed her hair and drew his sword and for one hideous instant she was certain he meant to open her throat as he laid the flat of the blade across her thighs she thought her legs might break from the force of the blow sansa screamed tears welled in her eyes it will be over soon she soon lost count of the blows enough she heard the hound rasp no it isnt the king replied boros make her naked boros shoved a meaty hand down the front of sansas bodice and gave a hard yank the silk came tearing away baring her to the waist sansa covered her breasts with her hands she could hear sniggers far off and cruel beat her bloody joffrey said well see how her brother fancies what is the meaning of this the imps voice cracked like a whip and suddenly sansa was free she stumbled to her knees arms crossed over her chest her breath ragged is this your notion of chivalry ser boros tyrion lannister demanded angrily his pet sellsword stood with him and one of his wildlings the one with the burned eye what sort of knight beats helpless maids the sort who serves his king imp ser boros raised his sword and ser meryn stepped up beside him his blade scraping clear of its scabbard careful with those warned the dwarfs sellsword you dont want to get blood all over those pretty white cloaks someone give the girl something to cover herself with the imp said sandor clegane unfastened his cloak and tossed it at her sansa clutched it against her chest fists bunched hard in the white wool the coarse weave was scratchy against her skin but no velvet had ever felt so fine this girls to be your queen the imp told joffrey have you no regard for her honor im punishing her for what crime she did not fight her brothers battle she has the blood of a wolf page and you have the wits of a goose you cant talk to me that way the king can do as he likes aerys targaryen did as he liked has your mother ever told you what happened to him ser boros blount harrumphed no man threatens his grace in the presence of the kingsguard tyrion lannister raised an eyebrow i am not threatening the king ser i am educating my nephew bronn timett the next time ser boros opens his mouth kill him the dwarf smiled now that was a threat ser see the difference ser boros turned a dark shade of red the queen will hear of this no doubt she will and why wait joffrey shall we send for your mother the king flushed nothing to say your grace his uncle went on good learn to use your ears more and your mouth less or your reign will be shorter than i am wanton brutality is no way to win your peoples love or your queens fear is better than love mother says joffrey pointed at sansa she fears me the imp sighed yes i see a pity stannis and renly arent twelveyearold girls as well bronn timett bring her sansa moved as if in a dream she thought the imps men would take her back to her bedchamber in maegors holdfast but instead they conducted her to the tower of the hand she had not set foot inside that place since the day her father fell from grace and it made her feel faint to climb those steps again some serving girls took charge of her mouthing meaningless comforts to stop her shaking one stripped off the ruins of her gown and smallclothes and another bathed her and washed the sticky juice from her face and her hair as they scrubbed her down with soap and sluiced warm water over her head all she could see were the faces from the bailey knights are sworn to defend the weak protect women and fight for the right but none of them did a thing only ser dontos had tried to help and he was no longer a knight no more than the imp was nor the hound the hound hated knights i hate them too sansa thought they are no true knights not one of them after she was clean plump gingerheaded maester frenken came to see her he bid her lie facedown on the mattress while he spread a salve across the angry red welts that covered the backs of her legs afterward he mixed her a draught of dreamwine with some honey so it might go down easier sleep a bit child when you wake all this will seem a bad dream no it wont you stupid man sansa thought but she drank the drearnwine anyway and slept it was dark when she woke again not quite knowing where she was the room both strange and strangely familiar as she rose a stab of pain went through her legs and brought it all back tears filled her eyes someone had laid out a robe for her beside the bed sansa slipped it on and opened the door outside stood a hardfaced woman with leathery brown skin three necklaces looped about her scrawny page neck one was gold and one was silver and one was made of human ears where does she think shes going the woman asked leaning on a tall spear the godswood she had to find ser dontos beg him to take her home now before it was too late the halfman said youre not to leave the woman said pray here the gods will hear meekly sansa dropped her eyes and retreated back inside she realized suddenly why this place seemed so familiar theyve put me in aryas old bedchamber from when father was the hand of the king all her things are gone and the furnishings have been moved around but its the same a short time later a serving girl brought a platter of cheese and bread and olives with a flagon of cold water take it away sansa commanded but the girl left the food on a table she was thirsty she realized every step sent knives through her thighs but she made herself cross the room she drank two cups of water and was nibbling on an olive when the knock came anxiously she turned toward the door smoothed down the folds of her robe yes the door opened and tyrion lannister stepped inside my lady i trust i am not disturbing you am i your prisoner my guest he was wearing his chain of office a necklace of linked golden hands i thought we might talk as my lord commands sansa found it hard not to stare his face was so ugly it held a queer fascination for her the food and garments are to your satisfaction he asked if there is anything else you need you have only to ask you are most kind and this morning it was very good of you to help me you have a right to know why joffrey was so wroth six nights gone your brother fell upon my uncle stafford encamped with his host at a village called oxcross not three days ride from casterly rock your northerners won a crushing victory we received word only this morning robb will kill you all she thought exulting its terrible my lord my brother is a vile traitor the dwarf smiled wanly well hes no fawn hes made that clear enough ser lancel said robb led an army of wargs the imp gave a disdainful bark of laughter ser lancels a wineskin warrior who wouldnt know a warg from a wart your brother had his direwolf with him but i suspect thats as far as it went the northmen crept into my uncles camp and cut his horse lines and lord stark sent his wolf among them even wartrained destriers went mad knights were trampled to death in their pavilions and the rabble woke in terror and fled casting aside their weapons to run the faster ser stafford was slain as he chased after a horse lord rickard karstark drove a lance through his chest ser rubert brax is also dead along with ser lymond vikary lord crakehall and lord jast half a hundred more have been taken captive including jasts sons and my nephew martyn lannister those who survived are spreading wild tales and page swearing that the old gods of the north march with your brother then there was no sorcery lannister snorted sorcery is the sauce fools spoon over failure to hide the flavor of their own incompetence my muttonheaded uncle had not even troubled to post sentries it would seem his host was rawapprentice boys miners fieldhands fisherfolk the sweepings of lannisport the only mystery is how your brother reached him our forces still hold the stronghold at the golden tooth and they swear he did not pass the dwarf gave an irritated shrug well robb stark is my fathers bane joffrey is mine tell me what do you feel for my kingly nephew i love him with all my heart sansa said at once truly he did not sound convinced even now my love for his grace is greater than it has ever been the imp laughed aloud well someone has taught you to lie well you may be grateful for that one day child you are a child still are you not or have you flowered sansa blushed it was a rude question but the shame of being stripped before half the castle made it seem like nothing no my lord thats all to the good if it gives you any solace i do not intend that you ever wed joffrey no marriage will reconcile stark and lannister after all that has happened i fear mores the pity the match was one of king roberts better notions if joffrey hadnt mucked it up she knew she ought to say something but the words caught in her throat you grow very quiet tyrion lannister observed is this what you want an end to your betrothal i sansa did not know what to say is it a trick will he punish me if i tell the truth she stared at the dwarfs brutal bulging brow the hard black eye and the shrewd green one the crooked teeth and wiry beard i only want to be loyal loyal the dwarf mused and far from any lannisters i can scarce blame you for that when i was your age i wanted the same thing he smiled they tell me you visit the godswood every day what do you pray for sansa i pray for robbs victory and foffreys death and for home for winterfell i pray for an end to the fighting well have that soon enough there will be another battle between your brother robb and my lord father and that will settle the issue robb will beat him sansa thought he beat your uncle and your brother faime hell beat your father too it was as if her face were an open book so easily did the dwarf read her hopes do not take oxcross too much to heart my lady he told her not unkindly a battle is not a war and my lord father is assuredly not my uncle stafford the next time you visit the godswood pray that your brother has the wisdom to bend the knee once the north returns to the kings peace i mean to send you home he page hopped down off the window seat and said you may sleep here tonight ill give you some of my own men as a guard some stone crows perhaps no sansa blurted out aghast if she was locked in the tower of the hand guarded by the dwarfs men how would ser dontos ever spirit her away to freedom would you prefer black ears ill give you chella if a woman would make you more at ease please no my lord the wildlings frighten me he grinned me as well but more to the point they frighten joffrey and that nest of sly vipers and lickspittle dogs he calls a kingsguard with chella or timett by your side no one would dare offer you harm i would sooner return to my own bed a lie came to her suddenly but it seemed so right that she blurted it out at once this tower was where my fathers men were slain their ghosts would give me terrible dreams and i would see their blood wherever i looked tyrion lannister studied her face i am no stranger to nightmares sansa perhaps you are wiser than i knew permit me at least to escort you safely back to your own chambers chapter catelyn it was full dark before they found the village catelyn found herself wondering if the place had a name if so its people had taken that knowledge with them when they fled along with all they owned down to the candles in the sept ser wendel lit a torch and led her through the low door within the seven walls were cracked and crooked god is one septon osmynd had taught her when she was a girl with seven aspects as the sept is a single building with seven walls the wealthy septs of the cities had statues of the seven and an altar to each in winterfell septon chayle hung carved masks from each wall here catelyn found only rough charcoal drawings ser wendel set the torch in a sconce near the door and left to wait outside with robar royce catelyn studied the faces the father was bearded as ever the mother smiled loving and protective the warrior had his sword sketched in beneath his face the smith his hammer the maid was beautiful the crone wizened and wise and the seventh face the stranger was neither male nor female yet both ever the outcast the wanderer from far places less and more than human unknown and unknowable here the face was a black oval a shadow with stars for eyes it made catelyn uneasy she would get scant comfort there she knelt before the mother my lady look down on this battle with a mothers eyes they are all sons every one spare them if you can and page spare my own sons as well watch over robb and bran and rickon would that i were with them a crack ran down through the mothers left eye it made her look as if she were crying catelyn could hear ser wendels booming voice and now and again ser robars quiet answers as they talked of the coming battle otherwise the night was still not even a cricket could be heard and the gods kept their silence did your old gods ever answer you ned she wondered when you knelt before your heart tree did they hear you flickering torchlight danced across the walls making the faces seem half alive twisting them changing them the statues in the great septs of the cities wore the faces the stonemasons had given them but these charcoal scratchings were so crude they might be anyone the fathers face made her think of her own father dying in his bed at riverrun the warrior was renly and stannis robb and robert jaime lannister and jon snow she even glimpsed arya in those lines just for an instant then a gust of wind through the door made the torch sputter and the semblance was gone washed away in orange glare the smoke was making her eyes burn she rubbed at them with the heels of her scarred hands when she looked up at the mother again it was her own mother she saw lady minisa tully had died in childbed trying to give lord hoster a second son the baby had perished with her and afterward some of the life had gone out of father she was always so calm catelyn thought remembering her mothers soft hands her warm smile lf she had lived how different our lives might have been she wondered what lady minisa would make of her eldest daughter kneeling here before her i have come so many thousands of leagues and for what who have i served i have lost my daughters robb does not want me and bran and rickon must surely think me a cold and unnatural mother i was not even with ned when he died her head swam and the sept seemed to move around her the shadows swayed and shifted furtive animals racing across the cracked white walls catelyn had not eaten today perhaps that had been unwise she told herself that there had been no time but the truth was that food had lost its savor in a world without ned when they took his head off they killed me too behind her the torch spit and suddenly it seemed to her that it was her sisters face on the wall though the eyes were harder than she recalled not lysas eyes but cerseis cersei is a mother too no matter who fathered those children she felt them kick inside her brought them forth with her pain and blood nursed them at her breast lf they are truly faimes does cersei pray to you too my lady catelyn asked the mother she could see the proud cold lovely features of the lannister queen etched upon the wall the crack was still there even cersei could weep for her children each of the seven embodies all of the seven septon osmynd had told her once there was as much beauty in the crone as in the maiden and the mother could be fiercer than the warrior when her children were in danger yes she had seen enough of robert baratheon at winterfell to know that the king did not regard joffrey with any great warmth if the boy was truly jaimes seed robert would have put him to death along with his mother and few would have condemned him bastards were common enough but incest was a monstrous sin to both old gods and new and the children of such wickedness were named abominations in sept and godswood alike the dragon kings had wed brother to sister but they were the blood of old valyria where such practices had been common and like their dragons the targaryens answered to neither gods nor men page ned must have known and lord arryn before him small wonder that the queen had killed them both would i do any less for my own catelyn clenched her hands feeling the tightness in her scarred fingers where the assassins steel had cut to the bone as she fought to save her son bran knows too she whispered lowering her head gods be good he must have seen something heard something that was why they tried to kill him in his bed lost and weary catelyn stark gave herself over to her gods she knelt before the smith who fixed things that were broken and asked that he give her sweet bran his protection she went to the maid and beseeched her to lend her courage to arya and sansa to guard them in their innocence to the father she prayed for justice the strength to seek it and the wisdom to know it and she asked the warrior to keep robb strong and shield him in his battles lastly she turned to the crone whose statues often showed her with a lamp in one hand guide me wise lady she prayed show me the path i must walk and do not let me stumble in the dark places that lie ahead finally there were footsteps behind her and a noise at the door my lady ser robar said gently pardon but our time is at an end we must be back before the dawn breaks catelyn rose stiffly her knees ached and she would have given much for a featherbed and a pillow just then thank you ser i am ready they rode in silence through sparse woodland where the trees leaned drunkenly away from the sea the nervous whinny of horses and the clank of steel guided them back to renlys camp the long ranks of man and horse were armored in darkness as black as if the smith had hammered night itself into steel there were banners to her right banners to her left and rank on rank of banners before her but in the predawn gloom neither colors nor sigils could be discerned a grey army catelyn thought grey men on grey horses beneath grey banners as they sat their horses waiting renlys shadow knights pointed their lances upward so she rode through a forest of tall naked trees bereft of leaves and life where storms end stood was only a deeper darkness a wall of black through which no stars could shine but she could see torches moving across the fields where lord stannis had made his camp the candles within renlys pavilion made the shimmering silken walls seem to glow transforming the great tent into a magical castle alive with emerald light two of the rainbow guard stood sentry at the door to the royal pavilion the green light shone strangely against the purple plums of ser parmens surcoat and gave a sickly hue to the sunflowers that covered every inch of ser emmons enameled yellow plate long silken plumes flew from their helms and rainbow cloaks draped their shoulders within catelyn found brienne armoring the king for battle while the lords tarly and rowan spoke of dispositions and tactics it was pleasantly warm inside the heat shimmering off the coals in a dozen small iron braziers i must speak with you your grace she said granting him a kings style for once anything to make him heed her in a moment lady catelyn renly replied brienne fit backplate to breastplate over his quilted tunic the kings armor was a deep green the green of leaves in a summer wood so dark it drank the candlelight gold highlights gleamed from inlay and fastenings like distant fires in that wood winking every time he moved pray continue lord mathis your grace mathis rowan said with a sideways glance at catelyn as i was saying our battles are well drawn up why wait for daybreak sound the advance page and have it said that i won by treachery with an unchivalrous attack dawn was the chosen hour chosen by stannis randyll tarly pointed out hed have us charge into the teeth of the rising sun well be halfblind only until first shock renly said confidently ser loras will break them and after that it will be chaos brienne tightened green leather straps and buckled golden buckles when my brother falls see that no insult is done to his corpse he is my own blood i will not have his head paraded about on a spear and if he yields lord tarly asked yields lord rowan laughed when mace tyrell laid siege to storms end stannis ate rats rather than open his gates well i remember renly lifted his chin to allow brienne to fasten his gorget in place near the end ser gawen wylde and three of his knights tried to steal out a postern gate to surrender stannis caught them and ordered them flung from the walls with catapults i can still see gawens face as they strapped him down he had been our masteratarms lord rowan appeared puzzled no men were hurled from the walls i would surely remember that maester cressen told stannis that we might be forced to eat our dead and there was no gain in flinging away good meat renly pushed back his hair brienne bound it with a velvet tie and pulled a padded cap down over his ears to cushion the weight of his helm thanks to the onion knight we were never reduced to dining on corpses but it was a close thing too close for ser gawen who died in his cell your grace catelyn had waited patiently but time grew short you promised me a word renly nodded see to your battles my lords oh and if barristan selmy is at my brothers side i want him spared theres been no word of ser barristan since joffrey cast him out lord rowan objected i know that old man he needs a king to guard or who is he yet he never came to me and lady catelyn says he is not with robb stark at riverrun where else but with stannis as you say your grace no harm will come to him the lords bowed deeply and departed say your say lady stark renly said brienne swept his cloak over his broad shoulders it was clothof gold heavy with the crowned stag of baratheon picked out in flakes of jet the lannisters tried to kill my son bran a thousand times i have asked myself why your brother gave me my answer there was a hunt the day he fell robert and ned and most of the other men rode out after boar but jaime lannister remained at winterfell as did the queen renly was not slow to take the implication so you believe the boy caught them at their incest page i beg you my lord grant me leave to go to your brother stannis and tell him what i suspect to what end robb will set aside his crown if you and your brother will do the same she said hoping it was true she would make it true if she must robb would listen to her even if his lords would not let the three of you call for a great council such as the realm has not seen for a hundred years we will send to winterfell so bran may tell his tale and all men may know the lannisters for the true usurpers let the assembled lords of the seven kingdoms choose who shall rule them renly laughed tell me my lady do direwolves vote on who should lead the pack brienne brought the kings gauntlets and greathelm crowned with golden antlers that would add a foot and a half to his height the time for talk is done now we see who is stronger renly pulled a lobstered greenandgold gauntlet over his left hand while brienne knelt to buckle on his belt heavy with the weight of longsword and dagger i beg you in the name of the mother catelyn began when a sudden gust of wind flung open the door of the tent she thought she glimpsed movement but when she turned her head it was only the kings shadow shifting against the silken walls she heard renly begin a jest his shadow moving lifting its sword black on green candles guttering shivering something was queer wrong and then she saw renlys sword still in its scabbard sheathed still but the shadowsword cold said renly in a small puzzled voice a heartbeat before the steel of his gorget parted like cheesecloth beneath the shadow of a blade that was not there he had time to make a small thick gasp before the blood came gushing out of his throat your grno cried brienne the blue when she saw that evil flow sounding as scared as any little girl the king stumbled into her arms a sheet of blood creeping down the front of his armor a dark red tide that drowned his green and gold more candles guttered out renly tried to speak but he was choking on his own blood his legs collapsed and only briennes strength held him up she threw back her head and screamed wordless in her anguish the shadow something dark and evil had happened here she knew something that she could not begin to understand renly never cast that shadow death came in that door and blew the life out of him as swift as the wind snuffed out his candles only a few instants passed before robar royce and emmon cuy came bursting in though it felt like half the night a pair of menatarms crowded in behind with torches when they saw renly in briennes arms and her drenched with the kings blood ser robar gave a cry of horror wicked woman screamed ser emmon he of the sunflowered steel away from him you vile creature gods be good brienne why asked ser robar brienne looked up from her kings body the rainbow cloak that hung from her shoulders had turned red where the kings blood had soaked into the cloth i i youll die for this ser emmon snatched up a longhandled battleaxe from the weapons piled near the door youll pay for the kings life with your own no catelyn stark screamed finding her voice at last but it was too late the blood madness was on page them and they rushed forward with shouts that drowned her softer words brienne moved faster than catelyn would have believed her own sword was not to hand so she snatched renlys from its scabbard and raised it to catch emmons axe on the downswing a spark flashed bluewhite as steel met steel with a rending crash and brienne sprang to her feet the body of the dead king thrust rudely aside ser emmon stumbled over it as he tried to close and briennes blade sheared through the wooden haft to send his axehead spinning another man thrust a flaming torch at her back but the rainbow cloak was too sodden with blood to burn brienne spun and cut and torch and hand went flying flames crept across the carpet the maimed man began to scream ser emmon dropped the axe and fumbled for his sword the second manatarms lunged brienne parried and their swords danced and clanged against each other when emmon cuy came wading back in brienne was forced to retreat yet somehow she held them both at bay on the ground renlys head rolled sickeningly to one side and a second mouth yawned wide the blood coming from him now in slow pulses ser robar had hung back uncertain but now he was reaching for his hilt robar no listen catelyn seized his arm you do her wrong it was not her help her hear me it was stannis the name was on her lips before she could think how it got there but as she said it she knew that it was true i swear it you know me it was stannis killed him the young rainbow knight stared at this madwoman with pale and frightened eyes stannis how i do not know sorcery some dark magic there was a shadow a shadow her own voice sounded wild and crazed to her but the words poured out in a rush as the blades continued to clash behind her a shadow with a sword i swear it i saw are you blind the girl loved him help her she glanced back saw the second guardsman fall his blade dropping from limp fingers outside there was shouting more angry men would be bursting in on them any instant she knew she is innocent robar you have my word on my husbands grave and my honor as a stark that resolved him i will hold them ser robar said get her away he turned and went out the fire had reached the wall and was creeping up the side of the tent ser emmon was pressing brienne hard him in his enameled yellow steel and her in wool he had forgotten catelyn until the iron brazier came crashing into the back of his head helmed as he was the blow did no lasting harm but it sent him to his knees brienne with me catelyn commanded the girl was not slow to see the chance a slash and the green silk parted they stepped out into darkness and the chill of dawn loud voices came from the other side of the pavilion this way catelyn urged and slowly we must not run or they will ask why walk easy as if nothing were amiss brienne thrust her sword blade through her belt and fell in beside catelyn the night air smelled of rain behind them the kings pavilion was well ablaze flames rising high against the dark no one made any move to stop them men rushed past them shouting of fire and murder and sorcery others stood in small groups and spoke in low voices a few were praying and one young squire was on his knees sobbing openly renlys battles were already coming apart as the rumors spread from mouth to mouth the nightfires had burned low and as the east began to lighten the immense mass of storms end emerged like a dream of stone while wisps of pale mist raced across the field flying from the sun on wings of wind morning ghosts she had heard old nan call them once spirits returning to their graves and renly one of them now gone like his brother robert like her own dear ned page i never held him but as he died brienne said quietly as they walked through the spreading chaos her voice sounded as if she might break at any instant he was laughing one moment and suddenly the blood was everywhere my lady i do not understand did you see did you i saw a shadow i thought it was renlys shadow at the first but it was his brothers lord stannis i felt him it makes no sense i know it made sense enough for brienne i will kill him the tall homely girl declared with my lords own sword i will kill him i swear it i swear it i swear it hal mollen and the rest of her escort were waiting with the horses ser wendel manderly was all in a lather to know what was happening my lady the camp has gone mad he blurted when he saw them lord renly is he he stopped suddenly staring at brienne and the blood that drenched her dead but not by our hands the battle hal mollen began there will be no battle catelyn mounted and her escort formed up about her with ser wendel to her left and ser perwyn frey on her right brienne we brought mounts enough for twice our number choose one and come with us i have my own horse my lady and my armor leave them we must be well away before they think to look for us we were both with the king when he was killed that will not be forgotten wordless brienne turned and did as she was bid ride catelyn commanded her escort when they were all ahorse if any man tries to stop us cut him down as the long fingers of dawn fanned across the fields color was returning to the world where grey men had sat grey horses armed with shadow spears the points of ten thousand lances now glinted silverly cold and on the myriad flapping banners catelyn saw the blush of red and pink and orange the richness of blues and browns the blaze of gold and yellow all the power of storms end and highgarden the power that had been renlys an hour ago they belong to stannis now she realized even if they do not know it themselves yet where else are they to turn if not to the last baratheon stannis has won all with a single evil stroke i am the rightful king he had declared his jaw clenched hard as iron and your son no less a traitor than my brother here his day will come as well a chill went through her chapter jon page the hill jutted above the dense tangle of forest rising solitary and sudden its windswept heights visible from miles off the wildlings called it the fist of the first men rangers said it did look like a fist jon snow thought punching up through earth and wood its bare brown slopes knuckled with stone he rode to the top with lord mormont and the officers leaving ghost below under the trees the direwolf had run off three times as they climbed twice returning reluctantly to jons whistle the third time the lord commander lost patience and snapped let him go boy i want to reach the crest before dusk find the wolf later the way up was steep and stony the summit crowned by a chesthigh wall of tumbled rocks they had to circle some distance west before they found a gap large enough to admit the horses this is good ground thoren the old bear proclaimed when at last they attained the top we could scarce hope for better well make our camp here to await halfhand the lord commander swung down off his saddle dislodging the raven from his shoulder complaining loudly the bird took to the air the views atop the hill were bracing yet it was the ringwall that drew jons eye the weathered grey stones with their white patches of lichen their beards of green moss it was said that the fist had been a ringfort of the first men in the dawn age an old place and strong thoren smallwood said old mormonts raven screamed as it flapped in noisy circles about their heads old old old quiet mormont growled up at the bird the old bear was too proud to admit to weakness but jon was not deceived the strain of keeping up with younger men was taking its toll these heights will be easy to defend if need be thoren pointed out as he walked his horse along the ring of stones his sabletrimmed cloak stirring in the wind yes this place will do the old bear lifted a hand to the wind and raven landed on his forearm claws scrabbling against his black ringmail what about water my lord jon wondered we crossed a brook at the foot of the hill a long climb for a drink jon pointed out and outside the ring of stones thoren said are you too lazy to climb a hill boy when lord mormont said were not like to find another place as strong well carry water and make certain we are well supplied jon knew better than to argue so the command was given and the brothers of the nights watch raised their camp behind the stone ring the first men had made black tents sprouted like mushrooms after a rain and blankets and bedrolls covered the bare ground stewards tethered the garrons in long lines and saw them fed and watered foresters took their axes to the trees in the waning afternoon light to harvest enough wood to see them through the night a score of builders set to clearing brush digging latrines and untying their bundles of firehardened stakes i will have every opening in the ringwall ditched and staked before dark the old bear had commanded once hed put up the lord commanders tent and seen to their horses jon snow descended the hill in page search of ghost the direwolf came at once all in silence one moment jon was striding beneath the trees whistling and shouting alone in the green pinecones and fallen leaves under his feet the next the great white direwolf was walking beside him pale as morning mist but when they reached the ringfort ghost balked again he padded forward warily to sniff at the gap in the stones and then retreated as if he did not like what hed smelled jon tried to grab him by the scruff of his neck and haul him bodily inside the ring no easy task the wolf weighed as much as he did and was stronger by far ghost whats wrong with you it was not like him to be so unsettled in the end jon had to give it up as you will he told the wolf go hunt the red eyes watched him as he made his way back through the mossy stones they ought to be safe here the hill offered commanding views and the slopes were precipitous to the north and west and only slightly more gentle to the east yet as the dusk deepened and darkness seeped into the hollows between the trees jons sense of foreboding grew this is the haunted forest he told himself maybe there are ghosts here the spirits of the first men this was their place once stop acting the boy he told himself clambering atop the piled rocks jon gazed off toward the setting sun he could see the light shimmering like hammered gold off the surface of the milkwater as it curved away to the south upriver the land was more rugged the dense forest giving way to a series of bare stony hills that rose high and wild to the north and west on the horizon stood the mountains like a great shadow range on range of them receding into the bluegrey distance their jagged peaks sheathed eternally in snow even from afar they looked vast and cold and inhospitable closer at hand it was the trees that ruled to south and east the wood went on as far as jon could see a vast tangle of root and limb painted in a thousand shades of green with here and there a patch of red where a weirwood shouldered through the pines and sentinels or a blush of yellow where some broadleafs had begun to turn when the wind blew he could hear the creak and groan of branches older than he was a thousand leaves fluttered and for a moment the forest seemed a deep green sea stormtossed and heaving eternal and unknowable ghost was not like to be alone down there he thought anything could be moving under that sea creeping toward the ringfort through the dark of the wood concealed beneath those trees anything how would they ever know he stood there for a long time until the sun vanished behind the sawtoothed mountains and darkness began to creep through the forest jon samwell tarly called up i thought it looked like you are you well well enough jon hopped down how did you fare today well i fared well truly jon was not about to share his disquiet with his friend not when samwell tarly was at last beginning to find his courage the old bear means to wait here for qhorin halfhand and the men from the shadow tower it seems a strong place said sam a ringfort of the first men do you think there were battles fought here no doubt youd best get a bird ready mormont will want to send back word page i wish i could send them all they hate being caged you would too if you could fly if i could fly id be back at castle black eating a pork pie said sam jon clapped him on the shoulder with his burned hand they walked back through the camp together cookfires were being lit all around them overhead the stars were coming out the long red tail of mormonts torch burned as bright as the moon jon heard the ravens before he saw them some were calling his name the birds were not shy when it came to making noise they feel it too id best see to the old bear he said he gets noisy when he isnt fed as well he found mormont talking with thoren smallwood and half a dozen other officers there you are the old man said gruffly bring us some hot wine if you would the night is chilly yes my lord jon built a cookfire claimed a small cask of mormonts favorite robust red from stores and poured it into a kettle he hung the kettle above the flames while he gathered the rest of his ingredients the old bear was particular about his hot spiced wine so much cinnamon and so much nutmeg and so much honey not a drop more raisins and nuts and dried berries but no lemon that was the rankest sort of southron heresywhich was queer since he always took lemon in his morning beer the drink must be hot to warm a man properly the lord commander insisted but the wine must never be allowed to come to a boil jon kept a careful eye on the kettle as he worked he could hear the voices from inside the tent jarman buckwell said the easiest road up into the frostfangs is to follow the milkwater back to its source yet if we go that path rayder will know of our approach certain as sunrise the giants stair might serve said ser mallador locke or the skirling pass if its clear the wine was steaming jon lifted the kettle off the fire filled eight cups and carried them into the tent the old bear was peering at the crude map sam had drawn him that night back in crasters keep he took a cup from jons tray tried a swallow of wine and gave a brusque nod of approval his raven hopped down his arm corn it said corn corn ser ottyn wythers waved the wine away i would not go into the mountains at all he said in a thin tired voice the frostfangs have a cruel bite even in summer and now if we should be caught by a storm i do not mean to risk the frostfangs unless i must said mormont wildlings can no more live on snow and stone than we can they will emerge from the heights soon and for a host of any size the only route is along the milkwater if so we are strongly placed here they cannot hope to slip by us they may not wish to they are thousands and we will be three hundred when the halfhand reaches us ser mallador accepted a cup from jon if it comes to battle we could not hope for better ground than here declared mormont well strengthen the defenses pits and spikes caltrops scattered on the slopes every breach mended jarman page ill want your sharpest eyes as watchers a ring of them all around us and along the river to warn of any approach hide them up in trees and we had best start bringing up water too more than we need well dig cisterns it will keep the men occupied and may prove needful later my rangers started thoren smallwood your rangers will limit their ranging to this side of the river until the halfhand reaches us after that well see i will not lose more of my men mance rayder might be massing his host a days ride from here and wed never know smallwood complained we know where the wildlings are massing mormont came back we had it from craster i mislike the man but i do not think he lied to us in this as you say smallwood took a sullen leave the others finished their wine and followed more courteously shall i bring you supper my lord jon asked corn the raven cried mormont did not answer at once when he did he said only did your wolf find game today hes not back yet we could do with fresh meat mormont dug into a sack and offered his raven a handful of corn you think im wrong to keep the rangers close thats not for me to say my lord it is if youre asked if the rangers must stay in sight of the fist i dont see how they can hope to find my uncle jon admitted they cant the raven pecked at the kernels in the old bears palm two hundred men or ten thousand the country is too vast the corn gone mormont turned his hand over you would not give up the search maester aemon thinks you clever mormont moved the raven to his shoulder the bird tilted its head to one side little eyes aglitter the answer was there is it it seems to me that it might be easier for one man to find two hundred than for two hundred to find one the raven gave a cackling scream but the old bear smiled through the grey of his beard this many men and horses leave a trail even aemon could follow on this hill our fires ought to be visible as far off as the foothills of the frostfangs if ben stark is alive and free he will come to us i have no doubt page yes said jon but what if hes dead mormont asked not unkindly jon nodded reluctantly dead the raven said dead dead he may come to us anyway the old bear said as othor did and jafer flowers i dread that as much as you jon but we must admit the possibility dead his raven cawed ruffling its wings its voice grew louder and more shrill dead mormont stroked the birds black feathers and stifled a sudden yawn with the back of his hand i will forsake supper i believe rest will serve me better wake me at first light sleep well my lord jon gathered up the empty cups and stepped outside he heard distant laughter the plaintive sound of pipes a great blaze was crackling in the center of the camp and he could smell stew cooking the old bear might not be hungry but jon was he drifted over toward the fire dywen was holding forth spoon in hand i know this wood as well as any man alive and i tell you i wouldnt care to ride through it alone tonight cant you smell it grenn was staring at him with wide eyes but dolorous edd said all i smell is the shit of two hundred horses and this stew which has a similar aroma now that i come to sniff it ive got your similar aroma right here hake patted his dirk grumbling he filled jons bowl from the kettle the stew was thick with barley carrot and onion with here and there a ragged shred of salt beef softened in the cooking what is it you smell dywen asked grenn the forester sucked on his spoon a moment he had taken out his teeth his face was leathery and wrinkled his hands gnarled as old roots seems to me like it smells well cold your heads as wooden as your teeth hake told him theres no smell to cold there is thought jon remembering the night in the lord commanders chambers it smells like death suddenly he was not hungry anymore he gave his stew to grenn who looked in need of an extra supper to warm him against the night the wind was blowing briskly when he left by morning frost would cover the ground and the tent ropes would be stiff and frozen a few fingers of spiced wine sloshed in the bottom of the kettle jon fed fresh wood to the fire and put the kettle over the flames to reheat he flexed his fingers as he waited squeezing and spreading until the hand tingled the first watch had taken up their stations around the perimeter of the camp torches flickered all along the ringwall the night was moonless but a thousand page stars shone overhead a sound rose out of the darkness faint and distant but unmistakable the howling of wolves their voices rose and fell a chilly song and lonely it made the hairs rise along the back of his neck across the fire a pair of red eyes regarded him from the shadows the light of the flames made them glow ghost jon breathed surprised so you came inside after all eh the white wolf often hunted all night he had not expected to see him again till daybreak was the hunting so bad he asked here to me ghost the direwolf circled the fire sniffing jon sniffing the wind never still it did not seem as if he were after meat right now when the dead came walking ghost knew he woke me warned me alarmed he got to his feet is something out there ghost do you have a scent dywen said he smelled cold the direwolf loped off stopped looked back he wants me to follow pulling up the hood of his cloak jon walked away from the tents away from the warmth of his fire past the lines of shaggy little garrons one of the horses whickered nervously when ghost padded by jon soothed him with a word and paused to stroke his muzzle he could hear the wind whistling through cracks in the rocks as they neared the ringwall a voice called out a challenge jon stepped into the torchlight i need to fetch water for the lord commander go on then the guard said be quick about it huddled beneath his black cloak with his hood drawn up against the wind the man never even looked to see if he had a bucket jon slipped sideways between two sharpened stakes while ghost slid beneath them a torch had been thrust down into a crevice its flames flying pale orange banners when the gusts came he snatched it up as he squeezed through the gap between the stones ghost went racing down the hill jon followed more slowly the torch thrust out before him as he made his descent the camp sounds faded behind him the night was black the slope steep stony and uneven a moments inattention would be a sure way to break an ankle or his neck what am i doing he asked himself as he picked his way down the trees stood beneath him warriors armored in bark and leaf deployed in their silent ranks awaiting the command to storm the hill black they seemed it was only when his torchlight brushed against them that jon glimpsed a flash of green faintly he heard the sound of water flowing over rocks ghost vanished in the underbrush jon struggled after him listening to the call of the brook to the leaves sighing in the wind branches clutched at his cloak while overhead thick limbs twined together and shut out the stars he found ghost lapping from the stream ghost he called to me now when the direwolf raised his head his eyes glowed red and baleful and water streamed down from his jaws like slaver there was something fierce and terrible about him in that instant and then he was off bounding past jon racing through the trees ghost no stay he shouted but the wolf paid no heed the lean white shape was swallowed by the dark and jon had only two choicesto climb the hill again alone or to follow he followed angry holding the torch out low so he could see the rocks that threatened to trip him with every step the thick roots that seemed to grab as his feet the holes where a man could twist an ankle every few feet he called again for ghost but the night wind was swirling amongst the trees and it drank the words this is madness he thought as he plunged deeper into the trees he was about to turn back when he glimpsed a flash of white off ahead and to the right back toward the hill he jogged after it cursing under his breath page a quarter way around the fist he chased the wolf before he lost him again finally he stopped to catch his breath amidst the scrub thorns and tumbled rocks at the base of the hill beyond the torchlight the dark pressed close a soft scrabbling noise made him turn jon moved toward the sound stepping carefully among boulders and thornbushes behind a fallen tree he came on ghost again the direwolf was digging furiously kicking up dirt what have you found jon lowered the torch revealing a rounded mound of soft earth a grave he thought but whose he knelt jammed the torch into the ground beside him the soil was loose sandy jon pulled it out by the fistful there were no stones no roots whatever was here had been put here recently two feet down his fingers touched cloth he had been expecting a corpse fearing a corpse but this was something else he pushed against the fabric and felt small hard shapes beneath unyielding there was no smell no sign of graveworms ghost backed off and sat on his haunches watching jon brushed the loose soil away to reveal a rounded bundle perhaps two feet across he jammed his fingers down around the edges and worked it loose when he pulled it free whatever was inside shifted and clinked treasure he thought but the shapes were wrong to be coins and the sound was wrong for metal a length of frayed rope bound the bundle together jon unsheathed his dagger and cut it groped for the edges of the cloth and pulled the bundle turned and its contents spilled out onto the ground glittering dark and bright he saw a dozen knives leafshaped spearheads numerous arrowheads jon picked up a dagger blade featherlight and shiny black hiltless torchlight ran along its edge a thin orange line that spoke of razor sharpness dragonglass what the maesters call obsidian had ghost uncovered some ancient cache of the children of the forest buried here for thousands of years the fist of the first men was an old place only beneath the dragonglass was an old warhorn made from an aurochs horn and banded in bronze jon shook the dirt from inside it and a stream of arrowheads fell out he let them fall and pulled up a corner of the cloth the weapons had been wrapped in rubbing it between his fingers good wool thick a double weave damp but not rotted it could not have been long in the ground and it was dark he seized a handful and pulled it close to the torch not dark black even before jon stood and shook it out he knew what he had the black cloak of a sworn brother of the nights watch chapter bran alebelly found him in the forge working the bellows for mikken maester wants you in the turret mlord prince theres been a bird from the king page from robb excited bran did not wait for hodor but let alebelly carry him up the steps he was a big man though not so big as hodor and nowhere near as strong by the time they reached the maesters turret he was redfaced and puffing rickon was there before them and both walder freys as well maester luwin sent alebelly away and closed his door my lords he said gravely we have had a message from his grace with both good news and ill he has won a great victory in the west shattering a lannister army at a place named oxcross and has taken several castles as well he writes us from ashemark formerly the stronghold of house marbrand rickon tugged at the maesters robe is robb coming home not just yet i fear there are battles yet to fight was it lord tywin he defeated asked bran no said the maester ser stafford lannister commanded the enemy host he was slain in the battle bran had never even heard of ser stafford lannister he found himself agreeing with big walder when he said lord tywin is the only one who matters tell robb i want him to come home said rickon he can bring his wolf home too and mother and father though he knew lord eddard was dead sometimes rickon forgot willfully bran suspected his little brother was stubborn as only a boy of four can be bran was glad for robbs victory but disquieted as well he remembered what osha had said the day that his brother had led his army out of winterfell hes marching the wrong way the wildling woman had insisted sadly no victory is without cost maester luwin turned to the walders my lords your uncle ser stevron frey was among those who lost their lives at oxcross he took a wound in the battle robb writes it was not thought to be serious but three days later he died in his tent asleep big walder shrugged he was very old fiveandsixty i think too old for battles he was always saying he was tired little walder hooted tired of waiting for our grandfather to die you mean does this mean ser emmons the heir now dont be stupid his cousin said the sons of the first son come before the second son ser ryman is next in line and then edwyn and black walder and petyr pimple and then aegon and all his sons ryman is old too said little walder past forty i bet and he has a bad belly do you think hell be lord ill be lord i dont care if he is maester luwin cut in sharply you ought to be ashamed of such talk my lords where is your grief your uncle is dead page yes said little walder were very sad they werent though bran got a sick feeling in his belly they like the taste of this dish better than i do he asked maester luwin to be excused very well the maester rang for help hodor must have been busy in the stables it was osha who came she was stronger than alebelly though and had no trouble lifting bran in her arms and carrying him down the steps osha bran asked as they crossed the yard do you know the way north to the wall and and even past the ways easy look for the ice dragon and chase the blue star in the riders eye she backed through a door and started up the winding steps and there are still giants there and the rest the others and the children of the forest too the giants ive seen the children ive heard tell of and the white walkers why do you want to know did you ever see a threeeyed crow no she laughed and i cant say id want to osha kicked open the door to his bedchamber and set him in his window seat where he could watch the yard below it seemed only a few heartbeats after she took her leave that the door opened again and jojen reed entered unbidden with his sister meera behind him you heard about the bird bran asked the other boy nodded it wasnt a supper like you said it was a letter from robb and we didnt eat it but the green dreams take strange shapes sometimes jojen admitted the truth of them is not always easy to understand tell me the bad thing you dreamed bran said the bad thing that is coming to winterfell does my lord prince believe me now will he trust my words no matter how queer they sound in his ears bran nodded it is the sea that comes the sea i dreamed that the sea was lapping all around winterfell i saw black waves crashing against the gates and towers and then the salt water came flowing over the walls and filled the castle drowned men were floating in the yard when i first dreamed the dream back at greywater i didnt know their faces but now i do that alebelly is one the guard who called our names at the feast your septons another your smith as well mikken bran was as confused as he was dismayed but the sea is hundreds and hundreds of leagues page away and winterfells walls are so high the water couldnt get in even if it did come in the dark of night the salt sea will flow over these walls said jojen i saw the dead bloated and drowned we have to tell them bran said alebelly and mikken and septon chayle tell them not to drown it will not save them replied the boy in green meera came to the window seat and put a hand on his shoulder they will not believe bran no more than you did jojen sat on brans bed tell me what you dream he was scared even then but he had sworn to trust them and a stark of winterfell keeps his sworn word theres different kinds he said slowly theres the wolf dreams those arent so bad as the others i run and hunt and kill squirrels and theres dreams where the crow comes and tells me to fly sometimes the tree is in those dreams too calling my name that frightens me but the worst dreams are when i fall he looked down into the yard feeling miserable i never used to fall before when i climbed i went everyplace up on the roofs and along the walls i used to feed the crows in the burned tower mother was afraid that i would fall but i knew i never would only i did and now when i sleep i fall all the time meera gave his shoulder a squeeze is that all i guess warg said jojen reed bran looked at him his eyes wide what warg shapechanger beastling that is what they will call ou if they should ever hear of your wolf dreams the names made him afraid again who will call me your own folk in fear some will hate you if they know what you are some will even try to kill you old nan told scary stories of beastlings and shapechangers sometimes in the stories they were always evil im not like that bran said im not its only dreams the wolf dreams are no true dreams you have your eye closed tight whenever youre awake but as you drift off it flutters open and your soul seeks out its other half the power is strong in you i dont want it i want to be a knight a knight is what you want a warg is what you are you cant change that bran you cant deny it or push it away you are the winged wolf but you will never fly jojen got up and walked to the window unless you open your eye he put two fingers together and poked bran in the forehead hard page when he raised his hand to the spot bran felt only the smooth unbroken skin there was no eye not even a closed one how can i open it if its not there you will never find the eye with your fingers bran you must search with your heart jojen studied brans face with those strange green eyes or are you afraid maester luwin says theres nothing in dreams that a man need fear there is said jojen what the past the future the truth they left him more muddled than ever when he was alone bran tried to open his third eye but he didnt know how no matter how he wrinkled his forehead and poked at it he couldnt see any different than hed done before in the days that followed he tried to warn others about what jojen had seen but it didnt go as he wanted mikken thought it was funny the sea is it happens i always wanted to see the sea never got where i could go to it though so now its coming to me is it the gods are good to take such trouble for a poor smith the gods will take me when they see fit septon chayle said qui etly though i scarcely think it likely that ill drown bran i grew up on the banks of the white knife you know im quite the strong swimmer alebelly was the only one who paid the warning any heed he went to talk to jojen himself and afterward stopped bathing and refused to go near the well finally he stank so bad that six of the other guards threw him into a tub of scalding water and scrubbed him raw while he screamed that they were going to drown him like the frogboy had said thereafter he scowled whenever he saw bran or jojen about the castle and muttered under his breath it was a few days after alebellys bath that ser rodrik returned to winterfell with his prisoner a fleshy young man with fat moist lips and long hair who smelled like a privy even worse than alebelly had reek hes called hayhead said when bran asked who it was i never heard his true name he served the bastard of bolton and helped him murder lady hornwood they say the bastard himself was dead bran learned that evening over supper ser rodriks men had caught him on hornwood land doing something horrible bran wasnt quite sure what but it seemed to be something you did without your clothes and shot him down with arrows as he tried to ride away they came too late for poor lady hornwood though after their wedding the bastard had locked her in a tower and neglected to feed her bran had heard men saying that when ser rodrik had smashed down the door he found her with her mouth all bloody and her fingers chewed off the monster has tied us a thorny knot the old knight told maester luwin like it or no lady hornwood was his wife he made her say the vows before both septon and heart tree and bedded her that very night before witnesses she signed a will naming him as heir and fixed her seal to it vows made at sword point are not valid the maester argued roose bolton may not agree not with land at issue ser rodrik looked unhappy would that i could page take this serving mans head off as well hes as bad as his master but i fear i must keep him alive until robb returns from his wars he is the only witness to the worst of the bastards crimes perhaps when lord bolton hears his tale he will abandon his claim but meantime we have manderly knights and dreadfort men killing one another in hornwood forests and i lack the strength to stop them the old knight turned in his seat and gave bran a stern look and what have you been about while ive been away my lord prince commanding our guardsmen not to wash do you want them smelling like this reek is that it the sea is coming here bran said jojen saw it in a green dream mebelly is going to drown maester luwin tugged at his chain collar the reed boy believes he sees the future in his dreams ser rodrik ive spoken to bran about the uncertainty of such prophecies but if truth be told there is trouble along the stony shore raiders in longships plundering fishing villages raping and burning leobald tallhart has sent his nephew benfred to deal with them but i expect theyll take to their ships and flee at the first sight of armed men aye and strike somewhere else the others take all such cowards they would never dare no more than the bastard of bolton if our main strength were not a thousand leagues south ser rodrik looked at bran what else did the lad tell you he said the water would flow over our walls he saw alebelly drowned and mikken and septon chayle too ser rodrik frowned well should it happen that i need to ride against these raiders myself i shant take alebelly then he didnt see me drowned did he no good it heartened bran to hear that maybe they wont drown then he thought ff they stay away from the sea meera thought so too later that night when she and joien met bran in his room to play a threesided game of tiles but her brother shook his head the things i see in green dreams cant be changed that made his sister angry why would the gods send a warning if we cant heed it and change whats to come i dont know joien said sadly if you were alebelly youd probably jump into the well to have done with it he should fight and bran should too me bran felt suddenly afraid what should i fight am i going to drown too meera looked at him guiltily i shouldnt have said he could tell that she was hiding something did you see me in a green dream he asked jojen nervously was i drowned not drowned jojen spoke as if every word pained him i dreamed of the man who came today the one they call reek you and your brother lay dead at his feet and he was skinning off your faces with a long red blade page meera rose to her feet if i went to the dungeon i could drive a spear right through his heart how could he murder bran if he was dead the gaolers will stop you joien said the guards and if you tell them why you want him dead theyll never believe i have guards too bran reminded them alebelly and poxy tym and hayhead and the rest jojens mossy eyes were full of pity they wont be able to stop him bran i couldnt see why but i saw the end of it i saw you and rickon in your crypts down in the dark with all the dead kings and their stone wolves no bran thought no if i went away to greywater or to the crow someplace far where they couldnt find me it will not matter the dream was green bran and the green dreams do not lie chapter tyrion vrys stood over the brazier warming his soft hands it would ppear renly was murdered most fearfully in the very midst of his army his throat was opened from ear to ear by a blade that passed through steel and bone as if they were soft cheese murdered by whose hand cersei demanded have you ever considered that too many answers are the same as no answer at all my informers are not always as highly placed as we might like when a king dies fancies sprout like mushrooms in the dark a groom says that renly was slain by a knight of his own rainbow guard a washerwoman claims stannis stole through the heart of his brothers army with his magic sword several menatarms believe a woman did the fell deed but cannot agree on which woman a maid that renly had spurned claims one a camp follower brought in to serve his pleasure on the eve of battle says a second the third ventures that it might have been the lady catelyn stark the queen was not pleased must you waste our time with every rumor the fools care to tell you pay me well for these rumors my gracious queen we pay you for the truth lord varys remember that or this small council may grow smaller still varys tittered nervously you and your noble brother will leave his grace with no council at all if you continue i daresay the realm could survive a few less councillors said littlefinger with a smile page dear dear petyr said varys are you not concerned that yours might be the next name on the hands little list before you varys i should never dream of it mayhaps we will be brothers on the wall together you and i varys giggled again sooner than youd like if the next words out of your mouth are not something useful eunuch from the look of her eyes cersei was prepared to castrate varys all over again might this be some ruse asked littlefinger if so it is a ruse of surpassing cleverness said varys it has certainly hoodwinked me tyrion had heard enough joff will be so disappointed he said he was saving such a nice spike for renlys head but whoever did the deed we must assume stannis was behind it the gain is clearly his he did not like this news he had counted on the brothers baratheon decimating each other in bloody battle he could feel his elbow throbbing where the morningstar had laid it open it did that sometimes in the damp he squeezed it uselessly in his hand and asked what of renlys host the greater part of his foot remains at bitterbridge varys abandoned the brazier to take his seat at the table most of the lords who rode with lord renly to storms end have gone over bannerandblade to stannis with all their chivalry led by the florents id wager said littlefinger varys gave him a simpering smile you would win my lord lord alester was indeed the first to bend the knee many others followed many tyrion said pointedly but not all not all agreed the eunuch not loras tyrell nor randyll tarly nor mathis rowan and storms end itself has not yielded ser cortnay penrose holds the castle in renlys name and will not believe his liege is dead he demands to see the mortal remains before he opens his gates but it seems that renlys corpse has unaccountably vanished carried away most likely a fifth of renlys knights departed with ser loras rather than bend the knee to stannis its said the knight of flowers went mad when he saw his kings body and slew three of renlys guards in his wrath among them emmon cuy and robar royce a pity he stopped at three thought tyrion ser loras is likely making for bitterbridge varys went on his sister is there renlys queen as well as a great many soldiers who suddenly find themselves kingless which side will they take now a ticklish question many serve the lords who remained at storms end and those lords now belong to stannis tyrion leaned forward there is a chance here it seems to me win loras tyrell to our cause and lord mace tyrell and his bannermen might join us as well they may have sworn their swords to stannis for the moment yet they cannot love the man or they would have been his from the start page is their love for us any greater asked cersei scarcely said tyrion they loved renly clearly but renly is slain perhaps we can give them good and sufficient reasons to prefer joffrey to stannis if we move quickly what sort of reasons do you mean to give them gold reasons littlefinger suggested at once varys made a tsking sound sweet petyr surely you do not mean to suggest that these puissant lords and noble knights could be bought like so many chickens in the market have you been to our markets of late lord varys asked littlefinger youd find it easier to buy a lord than a chicken i daresay of course lords cluck prouder than chickens and take it ill if you offer them coin like a tradesman but they are seldom adverse to taking gifts honors lands castles bribes might sway some of the lesser lords tyrion said but never highgarden true littlefinger admitted the knight of flowers is the key there mace tyrell has two older sons but loras has always been his favorite win him and highgarden will be yours yes tyrion thought it seems to me we should take a lesson from the late lord renly we can win the tyrell alliance as he did with a marriage varys understood the quickest you think to wed king joffrey to man gaery tyrell i do renlys young queen was no more than fifteen sixteen he seemed to recall older than joffrey but a few years were nothing it was so neat and sweet he could taste it joffrey is betrothed to sansa stark cersei objected marriage contracts can be broken what advantage is there in wedding the king to the daughter of a dead traitor littlefinger spoke up you might point out to his grace that the tyrells are much wealthier than the starks and that margaery is said to be lovely and beddable besides yes said tyrion joff ought to like that well enough my son is too young to care about such things you think so asked tyrion hes thirteen cersei the same age at which i married you shamed us all with that sorry episode joffrey is made of finer stuff so fine that he had ser boros rip off sansas gown he was angry with the girl he was angry with that cooks boy who spilled the soup last night as well but he didnt strip him naked page this was not a matter of some spilled soup no it was a matter of some pretty teats after that business in the yard tyrion had spoken with varys about how they might arrange for joffrey to visit chatayas a taste of honey might sweeten the boy he hoped he might even be grateful gods forbid and tyrion could do with a shade more gratitude from his sovereign it would need to be done secretly of course the tricky bit would be parting him from the hound the dog is never far from his masters heels hed observed to varys but all men sleep and some gamble and whore and visit winesinks as well the hound does all these things if that is your question no said tyrion my question is when varys had laid a finger on his cheek smiling enigmatically my lord a suspicious man might think you wished to find a time when sandor clegane was not protecting king joffrey the better to do the boy some harm surely you know me better than that lord varys tyrion said why all i want is for joffrey to love me the eunuch had promised to look into the matter the war made its own demands though joffreys initiation into manhood would need to wait doubtless you know your son better than i do he made himself tell cersei but regardless theres still much to be said for a tyrell marriage it may be the only way that joffrey lives long enough to reach his wedding night littlefinger agreed the stark girl brings joffrey nothing but her body sweet as that may be margaery tyrell brings fifty thousand swords and all the strength of highgarden indeed varys laid a soft hand on the queens sleeve you have a mothers heart and i know his grace loves his little sweetling yet kings must learn to put the needs of the realm before their own desires i say this offer must be made the queen pulled free of the eunuchs touch you would not speak so if you were women say what you will my lords but joffrey is too proud to settle for renlys leavings he will never consent tyrion shrugged when the king comes of age in three years he may give or withhold his consent as he pleases until then you are his regent and i am his hand and he will marry whomever we tell him to marry leavings or no cerseis quiver was empty make your offer then but gods save you all if joff does not like this girl im so pleased we can agree tyrion said now which of us shall go to bitterbridge we must reach ser loras with our offer before his blood can cool you mean to send one of the council i can scarcely expect the knight of flowers to treat with bronn or shagga can i the tyrells are proud page his sister wasted no time trying to twist the situation to her advantage ser jacelyn bywater is nobly born send him tyrion shook his head we need someone who can do more than repeat our words and fetch back a reply our envoy must speak for king and council and settle the matter quickly the hand speaks with the kings voice candlelight gleamed green as wildfire in cerseis eyes if we send you tyrion it will be as if joffrey went himself and who better you wield words as skillfully as jaime wields a sword are you that eager to get me out of the city cersei you are too kind sister but it seems to me that a boys mother is better fitted to arrange his marriage than any uncle and you have a gift for winning friends that i could never hope to match her eyes narrowed joff needs me at his side your grace my lord hand said littlefinger the king needs both of you here let me go in your stead you what gain does he see in this tyrion wondered i am of the kings council yet not the kings blood so i would make a poor hostage i knew ser loras passing well when he was here at court and gave him no cause to mislike me mace tyrell bears me no enmity that i know of and i flatter myself that i am not unskilled in negotiation he has us tyrion did not trust petyr baelish nor did he want the man out of his sight yet what other choice was left him it must be littlefinger or tyrion himself and he knew full well that if he left kings landing for any length of time all that he had managed to accomplish would be undone there is fighting between here and bitterbridge he said cautiously and you can be past certain that lord stannis will be dispatching his own shepherds to gather in his brothers wayward lambs ive never been frightened of shepherds its the sheep who trouble me still i suppose an escort might be in order i can spare a hundred gold cloaks tyrion said five hundred three hundred and forty moretwenty knights with as many squires if i arrive without a knightly tail the tyrells will think me of small account that was true enough agreed ill include horror and slobber in my party and send them on to their lord father afterward a gesture of goodwill we need paxter redwyne hes mace tyrells oldest friend and a great power in his own right and a traitor the queen said balking the arbor would have declared for renly with all the rest except that redwyne knew full well his whelps would suffer for it page renly is dead your grace littlefinger pointed out and neither stannis nor lord paxter will have forgotten how redwyne galleys closed the sea during the siege of storms end restore the twins and perchance we may win redwynes love cersei remained unconvinced the others can keep his love i want his swords and sails holding tight to those twins is the best way to make certain that well have them tyrion had the answer then let us send ser hobber back to the arbor and keep ser horas here lord paxter ought to be clever enough to riddle out the meaning of that i should think the suggestion was carried without protest but littlefinger was not done well want horses swift and strong the fighting will make remounts hard to come by a goodly supply of gold will also be needed for those gifts we spoke of earlier take as much as you require if the city falls stannis will steal it all anyway ill want my commission in writing a document that will leave mace tyrell in no doubt as to my authority granting me full power to treat with him concerning this match and any other arrangements that might be required and to make binding pledges in the kings name it should be signed by joffrey and every member of this council and bear all our seals tyrion shifted uncomfortably done will that be all i remind you theres a long road between here and bitterbridge ill be riding it before dawn breaks littlefinger rose i trust that on my return the king will see that i am suitably rewarded for my valiant efforts in his cause varys giggled joffrey is such a grateful sovereign im certain you will have no cause to complain my good brave lord the queen was more direct what do you want petyr littlefinger glanced at tyrion with a sly smile i shall need to give that some consideration no doubt ill think of something he sketched an airy bow and took his leave as casual as if he were off to one of his brothels tyrion glanced out the window the fog was so thick that he could not even see the curtain wall across the yard a few dim lights shone indistinct through that greyness a foul day for travel he thought he did not envy petyr baelish we had best see to drawing up those documents lord varys send for parchment and quill and someone will need to wake joffrey it was still grey and dark when the meeting finally ended varys scurried off alone his soft slippers whisking along the floor the lannisters lingered a moment by the door how comes your chain brother the queen asked as ser preston fastened a vairlined clothofsilver cloak about her shoulders link by link it grows longer we should thank the gods that ser cortnay penrose is as stubborn as he is stannis will never march north with storms end untaken in his rear tyrion i know we do not always agree on policy but it seems to me that i was wrong about you you are not so big a fool as i imagined in truth i realize now that you have been a great help for that i page thank you you must forgive me if i have spoken to you harshly in the past must i he gave her a shrug a smile sweet sister you have said nothing that requires forgiveness today you mean they both laughed and cersei leaned over and planted a quick soft kiss on his brow too astonished for words tyrion could only watch her stride off down the hall ser preston at her side have i lost my wits or did my sister just kiss me he asked bronn when she was gone was it so sweet it was unanticipated cersei had been behaving queerly of late tyrion found it very unsettling i am trying to recall the last time she kissed me i could not have been more than six or seven jaime had dared her to do it the womans finally taken note of your charms no tyrion said no the woman is hatching something best find out what bronn you know i hate surprises chapter theon theon wiped the spittle off his cheek with the back of his hand robb will gut you greyjoy benfred tallheart screamed hell feed your turncloaks heart to his wolf you piece of sheep dung aeron damphairs voice cut through the insults like a sword through cheese now you must kill him i have questions for him first said theon puck your questions benfred hung bleeding and helpless between stygg and werlag youll choke on them before you get any answers from me craven turncloak uncle aeron was relentless when he spits on you he spits on all of us he spits on the drowned god he must die my father gave me the command here uncle and sent me to counsel you and to watch me theon dare not push matters too far with his uncle the command was his yes but his men had a faith in the drowned god that they did not have in him and they were terrified of aeron damphair i cannot fault them for that youll lose your head for this greyjoy the crows will eat the jelly of your eyes benfred tried to spit page again but only managed a little blood the others bugger your wet god tallhart youve spit away your life theon thought stygg silence him he said they forced benfred to his knees werlag tore the rabbitskin off his belt and jammed it between his teeth to stop his shouting stygg unlimbered his axe no aeron damphair declared he must be given to the god the old way what does it matter dead is dead take him then you will come as well you command here the offering should come from you that was more than theon could stomach you are the priest uncle i leave the god to you do me the same kindness and leave the battles to me he waved his hand and werlag and stygg began to drag their captive off toward the shore aeron damphair gave his nephew a reproachful look then followed down to the pebbled beach they would go to drown benfred tallhart in salt water the old way perhaps its a kindness theon told himself as he stalked off in the other direction stygg was hardly the most expert of headsmen and benfred had a neck thick as a boars heavy with muscle and fat i used to mock him for it just to see how angry i could make him he remembered that had been what three years past when ned stark had ridden to torrhens square to see ser helman theon had accompanied him and spent a fortnight in benfreds company he could hear the rough noises of victory from the crook in the road where the battle had been fought if youd go so far as to call it a battle more like slaughtering sheep if truth be told sheep fleeced in steel but sheep nonetheless climbing a jumble of stone theon looked down on the dead men and dying horses the horses had deserved better tymor and his brothers had gathered up what mounts had come through the fight unhurt while urzen and black lorren silenced the animals too badly wounded to be saved the rest of his men were looting the corpses gevin harlaw knelt on a dead mans chest sawing off his finger to get at a ring paying the iron price my lord father would approve theon thought of seeking out the bodies of the two men hed slain himself to see if they had any jewelry worth the taking but the notion left a bitter taste in his mouth he could imagine what eddard stark would have said yet that thought made him angry too stark is dead and rotting and naught to me he reminded himself old botley who was called fishwhiskers sat scowling by his pile of plunder while his three sons added to it one of them was in a shoving match with a fat man named todric who was reeling among the slain with a horn of ale in one hand and an axe in the other clad in a cloak of white foxfur only slightly stained by the blood of its previous owner drunk theon decided watching him bellow it was said that the ironmen of old had oft been blooddrunk in battle so berserk that they felt no pain and feared no foe but this was a common aledrunk wex my bow and quiver the boy ran and fetched them theon bent the bow and slipped the string into its notches as todric knocked down the botley boy and flung ale into his eyes fishwhiskers leapt up cursing but theon was quicker he drew on the hand that clutched the drinking horn figuring to give them a shot to talk about but todric spoiled it by lurching to one side just as he loosed the arrow took him through the belly page the looters stopped to gape theon lowered his bow no drunkards i said and no squabbles over plunder on his knees todric was dying noisily botley silence him fishwhiskers and his sons were quick to obey they slit todrics throat as he kicked feebly and were stripping him of cloak and rings and weapons before he was even dead now they know i mean what i say lord balon might have given him the command but theon knew that some of his men saw only a soft boy from the green lands when they looked at him anyone else have a thirst no one replied good he kicked at benfreds fallen banner clutched in the dead hand of the squire whod borne it a rabbitskin had been tied below the flag why rabbitskins he had meant to ask but being spat on had made him forget his questions he tossed his bow back to wex and strode off remembering how elated hed felt after the whispering wood and wondering why this did not taste as sweet tallhart you bloody overproud fool you never even sent out a scout theyd been joking and even singing as theyd come on the three trees of tallhart streaming above them while rabbitskins flapped stupidly from the points of their lances the archers concealed behind the gorse had spoiled the song with a rain of arrows and theon himself had led his menatarms out to finish the butchers work with dagger axe and warhammer he had ordered their leader spared for questioning only he had not expected it to be benfred tallhart his limp body was being dragged from the surf when theon returned to his sea bitch the masts of his longships stood outlined against the sky along the pebbled beach of the fishing village nothing remained but cold ashes that stank when it rained the men had been put to the sword all but a handful that theon had allowed to flee to bring the word to torrhens square their wives and daughters had been claimed for salt wives those who were young enough and fair the crones and the ugly ones had simply been raped and killed or taken for thralls if they had useful skills and did not seem likely to cause trouble theon had planned that attack as well bringing his ships up to the shore in the chill darkness before the dawn and leaping from the prow with a longaxe in his hand to lead his men into the sleeping village he did not like the taste of any of this but what choice did he have his thricedamned sister was sailing her black wind north even now sure to win a castle of her own lord balon had let no word of the hosting escape the iron islands and theons bloody work along the stony shore would be put down to sea raiders out for plunder the northmen would not realize their true peril not until the hammers fell on deepwood motte and moat cailin and after all is done and won they will make songs for that bitch asha and forget that i was even here that is if he allowed it dagmer cleftjaw stood by the high carved prow of his longship foamdrinker theon had assigned him the task of guarding the ships otherwise men would have called it dagmers victory not his a more prickly man might have taken that for a slight but the cleftjaw had only laughed the day is won dagmer called down and yet you do not smile boy the living should smile for the dead cannot he smiled himself to show how it was done it made for a hideous sight under a snowy white mane of hair dagmer cleftjaw had the most gutchurning scar theon had ever seen the legacy of the longaxe that had near killed him as a boy the blow had splintered his jaw shattered his front teeth and left him four lips where other men had but two a shaggy beard covered his cheeks and neck but the hair would not grow over the scar so a shiny seam of puckered twisted flesh divided his face like a crevasse through a snowfield we could hear them singing the old warrior said it was a good song page and they sang it bravely they sang better than they fought harps would have done them as much good as their lances did how many men are lost of ours theon shrugged todric i killed him for getting drunk and fighting over loot some men are born to be killed a lesser man might have been afraid to show a smile as frightening as his yet dagmer grinned more often and more broadly than lord balon ever had ugly as it was that smile brought back a hundred memories theon had seen it often as a boy when hed jumped a horse over a mossy wall or flung an axe and split a target square hed seen it when he blocked a blow from dagmers sword when he put an arrow through a seagull on the wing when he took the tiller in hand and guided a longship safely through a snarl of foaming rocks he gave me more smiles than my father and eddard stark together even robb he ought to have won a smile the day hed saved bran from that wildling but instead hed gotten a scolding as if he were some cook whod burned the stew you and i must talk uncle theon said dagmer was no true uncle only a sworn man with perhaps a pinch of greyjoy blood four or five lives back and that from the wrong side of the blanket yet theon had always called him uncle nonetheless come onto my deck then there were no mlords from dagmer not when he stood on his own deck on the iron islands every captain was a king aboard his own ship he climbed the plank to the deck of the foamdrinker in four long strides and dagmer led him back to the cramped aft cabin where the old man poured a horn of sour ale and offered theon the same he declined we did not capture enough horses a few but well ill make do with what i have i suppose fewer men means more glory what need do we have of horses like most ironmen dagmer preferred to fight on foot or from the deck of a ship horses will only shit on our decks and get in our way if we sailed yes theon admitted i have another plan he watched the other carefully to see how he would take that without the cleftjaw he could not hope to succeed command or no the men would never follow him if both aeron and dagmer opposed him and he had no hope of winning over the sourfaced priest your lord father commanded us to harry the coast no more eyes pale as sea foam watched theon from under those shaggy white eyebrows was it disapproval he saw there or a spark of interest the latter he thought hoped you are my fathers man his best man and always have been pride theon thought he is proud i must use that his pride will be the key there is no man in the iron islands half so skilled with spear or sword you have been too long away boy when you left it was as you say but i am grown old in lord page greyjoys service the singers call andrik best now andrik the unsmiling they name him a giant of a man he serves lord drumm of old wyk and black lorren and qarl the maid are near as dread this andrik may be a great fighter but men do not fear him as they fear you aye thats so dagmer said the fingers curled around the drinking horn were heavy with rings gold and silver and bronze set with chunks of sapphire and garnet and dragonglass he had paid the iron price for every one theon knew if i had a man like you in my service i should not waste him on this childs business of harrying and burning this is no work for lord balons best man dagmers grin twisted his lips apart and showed the brown splinters of his teeth nor for his trueborn son he hooted i know you too well theon i saw you take your first step helped you bend your first bow tis not me who feels wasted by rights i should have my sisters command he admitted uncomfortably aware of how peevish that sounded you take this business too hard boy it is only that your lord father does not know you with your brothers dead and you taken by the wolves your sister was his solace he learned to rely on her and she has never failed him nor have i the starks knew my worth i was one of brynden blackfishs picked scouts and i charged with the first wave in the whispering wood i was that close to crossing swords with the kingslayer himself theon held his hands two feet apart daryn hornwood came between us and died for it why do you tell me this dagmer asked it was me who put your first sword in your hand i know you are no craven does my father the hoary old warrior looked as if he had bitten into something he did not like the taste of it is only theon the boy wolf is your friend and these starks had you for ten years i am no stark lord eddard saw to that i am a greyjoy and i mean to be my fathers heir how can i do that unless i prove myself with some great deed you are young other wars will come and you shall do your great deeds for now we are commanded to harry the stony shore let my uncle aeron see to it ill give him six ships all but foamdrinker and sea bitch and he can burn and drown to his gods surfeit the command was given you not aeron damphair so long as the harrying is done what does it matter no priest could do what i mean to nor what i ask of you i have a task that only dagmer cleftjaw can accomplish dagmer took a long draught from his horn tell me page he is tempted theon thought he likes this reavers work no better than i do if my sister can take a castle so can p asha has four or five times the men we do theon allowed himself a sly smile but we have four times the wits and five times the courage your father will thank me when i hand him his kingdom i mean to do a deed that the harpers will sing of for a thousand years he knew that would give dagmer pause a singer had made a song about the axe that cracked his jaw in half and the old man loved to hear it whenever he was in his cups he would call for a reaving song something loud and stormy that told of dead heroes and deeds of wild valor his hair is white and his teeth are rotten but he still has a taste for glory what would my part be in this scheme of yours boy dagmer cleftjaw asked after a long silence and theon knew he had won to strike terror into the heart of the foe as only one of your name could do youll take the great part of our force and march on torrhens square helman tallhart took his best men south and benfred died here with their sons his uncle leobald will remain with some small garrison if i had been able to question benfred i would know just how small make no secret of your approach sing all the brave songs you like i want them to close their gates is this torrhens square a strong keep strong enough the walls are stone thirty feet high with square towers at each corner and a square keep within stone walls cannot be fired how are we to take them we do not have the numbers to storm even a small castle you will make camp outside their walls and set to building catapults and siege engines that is not the old way have you forgotten ironmen fight with swords and axes not by flinging rocks there is no glory in starving out a foeman leobald will not know that when he sees you raising siege towers his old womans blood will run cold and he will bleat for help stay your archers uncle and let the raven fly the castellan at winterfell is a brave man but age has stiffened his wits as well as his limbs when he learns that one of his kings bannermen is under attack by the fearsome dagmer cleftjaw he will summon his strength and ride to tallharts aid it is his duty ser rodrik is nothing if not dutiful any force he summons will be larger than mine dagmer said and these old knights are more cunning than you think or they would never have lived to see their first grey hair you set us a battle we cannot hope to win theon this torrhens square will never fall page theon smiled its not torrhens square i mean to take chapter arya confusion and clangor ruled the castle men stood on the beds of wagons loading casks of wine sacks of flour and bundles of newfletched arrows smiths straightened swords knocked dents from breastplates and shoed destriers and pack mules alike mail shirts were tossed in barrels of sand and rolled across the lumpy surface of the flowstone yard to scour them clean weeses women had twenty cloaks to mend a hundred more to wash the high and humble crowded into the sept together to pray outside the walls tents and pavilions were coming down squires tossed pails of water over cookfires while soldiers took out their oilstones to give their blades one last good lick the noise was a swelling tide horses blowing and whickering lords shouting commands menatarms trading curses camp followers squabbling lord tywin lannister was marching at last ser addam marbrand was the first of the captains to depart a day before the rest he made a gallant show of it riding a spirited red courser whose mane was the same copper color as the long hair that streamed past ser addams shoulders the horse was barded in bronzecolored trappings dyed to match the riders cloak and emblazoned with the burning tree some of the castle women sobbed to see him go weese said he was a great horseman and sword fighter lord tywins most daring commander i hope he dies arya thought as she watched him ride out the gate his men streaming after him in a double column i hope they all die they were going to fight robb she knew listening to the talk as she went about her work arya had learned that robb had won some great victory in the west hed burned lannisport some said or else he meant to burn it hed captured casterly rock and put everyone to the sword or he was besieging the golden tooth but something had happened that much was certain weese had her running messages from dawn to dusk some of them even took her beyond the castle walls out into the mud and madness of the camp i could flee she thought as a wagon rumbled past her i could hop on the back of a wagon and hide or fall in with the camp followers no one would stop me she might have done it if not for weese hed told them more than once what hed do to anyone who tried to run off on him it wont be no beating oh no i wont lay a finger on you ill just save you for the qohorik yes i will ill save you for the crippler vargo hoat his name is and when he gets back hell cut off your feet maybe if weese were dead arya thought but not when she was with him he could look at you and smell what you were thinking he always said so weese never imagined she could read though so he never bothered to seal the messages he gave her arya peeked at them all but they were never anything good just stupid stuff sending this cart to the granary and that one to the armory one was a demand for payment on a gambling debt but the knight she gave it to couldnt read when she told him what it said he tried to hit her but arya ducked under the blow snatched a silverbanded drinking horn off his saddle and darted away the knight roared and came after her but she slid between two wayns wove through a crowd of archers and jumped a latrine page trench in his mail he couldnt keep up when she gave the horn to weese he told her that a smart little weasel like her deserved a reward ive got my eye on a plump crisp capon to sup on tonight well share it me and you youll like that everywhere she went arya searched for jaqen hghar wanting to whisper another name to him before those she hated were all gone out of her reach but amidst the chaos and confusion the lorathi sellsword was not to be found he still owed her two deaths and she was worried she would never get them if he rode off to battle with the rest finally she worked up the courage to ask one of the gate guards if hed gone one of lorchs men is he the man said he wont be going then his lordships named ser amory castellan of harrenhal that whole lots staying right here to hold the castle the bloody mummers will be left as well to do the foraging that goat vargo hoat is like to spit him and lorch have always hated each other the mountain would be leaving with lord tywin though he would command the van in battle which meant that dunsen polliver and raff would all slip between her fingers unless she could find jaqen and have him kill one of them before they left weasel weese said that afternoon get to the armory and tell lucan that ser lyonel notched his sword in practice and needs a new one heres his mark he handed her a square of paper be quick about it now hes to ride with ser kevan lannister arya took the paper and ran the armory adjoined the castle smithy a long highroofed tunnel of a building with twenty forges built into its walls and long stone water troughs for tempering the steel half of the forges were at work when she entered the walls rang with the sound of hammers and burly men in leather aprons stood sweating in the sullen heat as they bent over bellows and anvils when she spied gendry his bare chest was slick with sweat but the blue eyes under the heavy black hair had the stubborn look she remembered arya didnt know that she even wanted to talk to him it was his fault theyd all been caught which one is lucan she thrust out the paper im to get a new sword for ser lyonel never mind about ser lyonel he drew her aside by the arm last night hot pie asked me if i heard you yell winterfell back at the holdfast when we were all fighting on the wall i never did yes you did i heard you too everyone was yelling stuff arya said defensively hot pie yelled hot pie he must have yelled it a hundred times its what you yelled that matters i told hot pie he should clean the wax out of his ears that all you yelled was go to hell if he asks you you better say the same i will she said even though she thought go to hell was a stupid thing to yell she didnt dare tell hot pie who she really was maybe i should say hot pies name to laqen ill get lucan gendry said lucan grunted at the writing though arya did not think he could read it and pulled down a heavy longsword this is too good for that oaf and you tell him i said so he said as he gave her the blade page i will she lied if she did any such thing weese would beat her bloody lucan could deliver his own insults the longsword was a lot heavier than needle had been but arya liked the feel of it the weight of steel in her hands made her feel stronger maybe im not a water dancer yet but im not a mouse either a mouse couldnt use a sword but i can the gates were open soldiers coming and going drays rolling in empty and going out creaking and swaying under their loads she thought about going to the stables and telling them that ser lyonel wanted a new horse she had the paper the stableboys wouldnt be able to read it any better than lucan had i could take the horse and the sword and just ride out if the guards tried to stop me id show them the paper and say i was bringing everything to ser lyonel she had no notion what ser lyonel looked like or where to find him though if they questioned her theyd know and then weese weese as she chewed her lip trying not to think about how it would feel to have her feet cut off a group of archers in leather jerkins and iron helms went past their bows slung across their shoulders arya heard snatches of their talk giants i tell you hes got giants twenty foot tall come down from beyond the wall follow him like dogs not natural coming on them so fast in the night and all hes more wolf than man all them starks are shit on your wolves and giants the boyd piss his pants if he knew we was coming he wasnt man enough to march on harrenhal was he ran vother way didnt he hed run now if he knew what was best for him so you say but might be the boy knows something we dont maybe its us ought to be run yes arya thought yes its you who ought to run you and lord win and the mountain and ser addam and ser amory and stupid ser lyonel whoever he is all of you better run or my brother will kill you hes a stark hes more wolf than man and so am l weasel weeses voice cracked like a whip she never saw where he came from but suddenly he was right in front of her give me that took you long enough he snatched the sword from her fingers and dealt her a stinging slap with the back of his hand next time be quicker about it for a moment she had been a wolf again but weeses slap took it all away and left her with nothing but the taste of her own blood in her mouth shed bitten her tongue when he hit her she hated him for that you want another weese demanded youll get it too ill have none of your insolent looks get down to the brewhouse and tell tuffleberry that i have two dozen barrels for him but he better send his lads to fetch them or ill find someone wants em worse arya started off but not quick enough for weese you run if you want to eat tonight he shouted his promises of a plump crisp capon already forgotten and dont be getting lost again or i swear ill beat you bloody you wont arya thought you wont ever again but she ran the old gods of the north must have been guiding her steps halfway to the brewhouse as she passing under the stone bridge that arched between widows tower and kingspyre page she heard harsh growling laughter rorge came around a corner with three other men the manticore badge of ser amory sewn over their hearts when he saw her he stopped and grinned showing a mouthful of crooked brown teeth under the leather flap he wore sometimes to cover the hole in his face yorens little cunt he called her guess we know why that black bastard wanted you on the wall dont we he laughed again and the others laughed with him wheres your stick now rorge demanded suddenly the smile gone as quick as it had come seems to me i promised to fuck you with it he took a step toward her arya edged backward not so brave now that im not in chains are you i saved you she kept a good yard between them ready to run quick as a snake if he made a grab for her owe you another fucking for that seems like did yoren pump your cunny or did he like that tight little ass better im looking for jaqen she said theres a message rorge halted something in his eyes could it be that he was scared of jaqen hghar the bathhouse get out of my way arya whirled and ran swift as a deer her feet flying over the cobbles all the way to the bathhouse she found jaqen soaking in a tub steam rising around him as a serving girl sluiced hot water over his head his long hair red on one side and white on the other fell down across his shoulders wet and heavy she crept up quiet as a shadow but he opened his eyes all the same she steals in on little mice feet but a man hears he said how could he hear me she wondered and it seemed as if he heard that as well the scuff of leather on stone sings loud as warhorns to a man with open ears clever girls go barefoot i have a message arya eyed the serving girl uncertainly when she did not seem likely to go away she leaned in until her mouth was almost touching his ear weese she whispered jaqen hghar closed his eyes again floating languid half asleep tell his lordship a man shall attend him at his leisure his hand moved suddenly splashing hot water at her and arya had to leap back to keep from getting drenched when she told tuffleberry what weese had said the brewer cursed loudly you tell weese my lads got duties to attend to and you tell him hes a poxridden bastard too and the seven hells will freeze over before he gets another horn of my ale ill have them barrels within the hour or lord tywin will hear of it see if he dont weese cursed too when arya brought back that message even though she left out the poxridden bastard part he fumed and threatened but in the end he rounded up six men and sent them off grumbling to fetch the barrels down to the brewhouse supper that evening was a thin stew of barley onion and carrots with a wedge of stale brown bread one of the women had taken to sleeping in weeses bed and she got a piece of ripe blue cheese as well and a wing off the capon that weese had spoken of that morning he ate the rest himself the grease running down in a shiny line through the boils that festered at the corner of his mouth the bird was almost gone when he glanced up from his trencher and saw arya staring weasel come here page a few mouthfuls of dark meat still clung to one thigh he forgot but now hes remembered arya thought it made her feel bad for telling jaqen to kill him she got off the bench and went to the head of the table i saw you looking at me weese wiped his fingers on the front of her shift then he grabbed her throat with one hand and slapped her with the other what did i tell you he slapped her again backhand keep those eyes to yourself or next time ill spoon one out and feed it to my bitch a shove sent her stumbling to the floor her hem caught on a loose nail in the splintered wooden bench and ripped as she fell youll mend that before you sleep weese announced as he pulled the last bit of meat off the capon when he was finished he sucked his fingers noisily and threw the bones to his ugly spotted dog weese arya whispered that night as she bent over the tear in her shift dunsen polliver raff the sweetling she said calling a name every time she pushed the bone needle through the undyed wool the tickler and the hound ser gregor ser amory ser ilyn ser meryn king joffrey queen cersei she wondered how much longer she would have to include weese in her prayer and drifted off to sleep dreaming that on the morrow when she woke hed be dead but it was the sharp toe of weeses boot that woke her as ever the main strength of lord tywins host would ride this day he told them as they broke their fast on oatcakes dont none of you be thinking how easy itll be here once mlord of lannister is gone he warned the castle wont grow no smaller i promise you that only now therell be fewer hands to tend to it you lot of slugabeds are going to learn what work is now yes you are not from you arya picked at her oaten cake weese frowned at her as if he smelled her secret quickly she dropped her gaze to her food and dared not raise her eyes again pale light filled the yard when lord tywin lannister took his leave of harrenhal arya watched from an arched window halfway up the wailing tower his charger wore a blanket of enameled crimson scales and gilded crinet and charnfron while lord tywin himself sported a thick ermine cloak his brother ser kevan looked near as splendid no less than four standardbearers went before them carrying huge crimson banners emblazoned with the golden lion behind the lannisters came their great lords and captains their banners flared and flapped a pageant of color red ox and golden mountain purple unicorn and bantam rooster brindled boar and badger a silver ferret and a juggler in motley stars and sunbursts peacock and panther chevron and dagger black hood and blue beetle and green arrow last of all came ser gregor clegane in his grey plate steel astride a stallion as badtempered as his rider polliver rode beside him with the black dog standard in his hand and gendrys horned helm on his head he was a tall man but he looked no more than a halfgrown boy when he rode in his masters shadow a shiver crept up aryas spine as she watched them pass under the great iron portcullis of harrenhal suddenly she knew that she had made a terrible mistake im so stupid she thought weese did not matter no more than chiswyck had these were the men who mattered the ones she ought to have killed last night she could have whispered any of them dead if only she hadnt been so mad at weese for hitting her and lying about the capon lord tywin why didnt i say lord tywin perhaps it was not too late to change her mind weese was not killed yet if she could find jaqen tell him page hurriedly arya ran down the twisting steps her chores forgotten she heard the rattle of chains as the portcullis was slowly lowered its spikes sinking deep into the ground and then another sound a shriek of pain and fear a dozen people got there before her though none was coming any too close arya squirmed between them weese was sprawled across the cobbles his throat a red ruin eyes gaping sightlessly up at a bank of grey cloud his ugly spotted dog stood on his chest lapping at the blood pulsing from his neck and every so often ripping a mouthful of flesh out of the dead mans face finally someone brought a crossbow and shot the spotted dog dead while she was worrying at one of weeses ears damnedest thing she heard a man say he had that bitch dog since she was a pup this place is cursed the man with the crossbow said its harrens ghost thats what it is said goodwife amabel ill not sleep here another night i swear it arya lifted her gaze from the dead man and his dead dog jaqen hghar was leaning up against the side of the wailing tower when he saw her looking he lifted a hand to his face and laid two fingers casually against his cheek chapter catelyn two days ride from riverrun a scout spied them watering their horses beside a muddy steam catelyn had never been so glad to see the twin tower badge of house frey when she asked him to lead them to her uncle he said the blackfish is gone west with the king my lady martyn rivers commands the outriders in his stead i see she had met rivers at the twins a baseborn son of lord walder frey half brother to ser perwyn it did not surprise her to learn that robb had struck at the heart of lannister power clearly he had been contemplating just that when he sent her away to treat with renly where is rivers now his camp is two hours ride my lady take us to him she commanded brienne helped her back into her saddle and they set out at once have you come from bitterbridge my lady the scout asked no she had not dared with renly dead catelyn had been uncertain of the reception she might receive from his young widow and her protectors instead she had ridden through the heart of the war through fertile riverlands turned to blackened desert by the fury of the lannisters and each night her scouts brought back tales that made her ill lord renly is slain she added page wed hoped that tale was some lannister lie or would that it were my brother commands in riverrun yes my lady his grace left ser edmure to hold riverrun and guard his rear gods grant him the strength to do so catelyn thought and the wisdom as well is there word from robb in the west you have not heard the man seemed surprised his grace won a great victory at oxcross ser stafford lannister is dead his host scattered ser wendel manderly gave a whoop of pleasure but catelyn only nodded tomorrows trials concerned her more than yesterdays triumphs martyn rivers had made his camp in the shell of a shattered holdfast beside a roofless stable and a hundred fresh graves he went to one knee when catelyn dismounted well met my lady your brother charged us to keep an eye out for your party and escort you back to riverrun in all haste should we come upon you catelyn scarce liked the sound of that is it my father no my lady lord hoster is unchanged rivers was a ruddy man with scant resemblance to his half brothers it is only that we feared you might chance upon lannister scouts lord tywin has left harrenhal and marches west with all his power rise she told rivers frowning stannis baratheon would soon be on the march as well gods help them all how long until lord tywin is upon us three days perhaps four it is hard to know we have eyes out along all the roads but it would be best not to linger nor did they rivers broke his camp quickly and saddled up beside her and they set off again near fifty strong now flying beneath the direwolf the leaping trout the twin towers her men wanted to hear more of robbs victory at oxcross and rivers obliged theres a singer come to riverrun calls himself rymund the rhymer hes made a song of the fight doubtless youll hear it sung tonight my lady wolf in the night this rymund calls it he went on to tell how the remnants of ser staffords host had fallen back on lannisport without siege engines there was no way to storm casterly rock so the young wolf was paying the lannisters back in kind for the devastation theyd inflicted on the riverlands lords karstark and glover were raiding along the coast lady mormont had captured thousands of cattle and was driving them back toward riverrun while the greatjon had seized the gold mines at castamere nunns deep and the pendric hills ser wendel laughed nothings more like to bring a lannister running than a threat to his gold how did the king ever take the tooth ser perwyn frey asked his bastard brother thats a hard strong keep and it commands the hill road he never took it he slipped around it in the night its said the direwolf showed him the way that grey page wind of his the beast sniffed out a goat track that wound down a defile and up along beneath a ridge a crooked and stony way yet wide enough for men riding single file the lannisters in their watchtowers got not so much a glimpse of them rivers lowered his voice theres some say that after the battle the king cut out stafford lannisters heart and fed it to the wolf i would not believe such tales catelyn said sharply my son is no savage as you say my lady still its no more than the beast deserved that is no common wolf that one the greatjons been heard to say that the old gods of the north sent those direwolves to your children catelyn remembered the day when her boys had found the pups in the late summer snows there had been five three male and two female for the five trueborn children of house stark and a sixth white of fur and red of eye for neds bastard son jon snow no common wolves she thought no indeed that night as they made their camp brienne sought out her tent my lady you are safely back among your own now a days ride from your brothers castle give me leave to go catelyn should not have been surprised the homely young woman had kept to herself all through their journey spending most of her time with the horses brushing out their coats and pulling stones from their shoes she had helped shadd cook and clean game as well and soon proved that she could hunt as well as any any task catelyn asked her to turn her hand to brienne had performed deftly and without complaint and when she was spoken to she answered politely but she never chattered nor wept nor laughed she had ridden with them every day and slept among them every night without ever truly becoming one of them it was the same when she was with renly catelyn thought at the feast in the melee even in renlys pavilion with her brothers of the rainbow guard there are walls around this one higher than winterfells if you left us where would you go catelyn asked her back brienne said to storms end alone it was not a question the broad face was a pool of still water giving no hint of what might live in the depths below yes you mean to kill stannis brienne closed her thick callused fingers around the hilt of her sword the sword that had been his i swore a vow three times i swore you heard me i did catelyn admitted the girl had kept the rainbow cloak when she discarded the rest of her bloodstained clothing she knew briennes own things had been left behind during their flight and she had been forced to clothe herself in odd bits of ser wendels spare garb since no one else in their party had garments large enough to fit her vows should be kept i agree but stannis has a great host around him and his own guards sworn to keep him safe i am not afraid of his guards i am as good as any of them i should never have fled is that what troubles you that some fool might call you craven she sighed renlys death was no fault page of youts you served him valiantly but when you seek to follow him into the earth you serve no one she stretched out a hand to give what comfort a touch could give i know how hard it is brienne shook off her hand no one knows youre wrong catelyn said sharply every morning when i wake i remember that ned is gone i have no skill with swords but that does not mean that i do not dream of riding to kings landing and wrapping my hands around cersei lannisters white throat and squeezing until her face turns black the beauty raised her eyes the only part of her that was truly beautiful if you dream that why would you seek to hold me back is it because of what stannis said at the parley was it catelyn glanced across the camp two men were walking sentry spears in hand i was taught that good men must fight evil in this world and renlys death was evil beyond all doubt yet i was also taught that the gods make kings not the swords of men if stannis is our rightful king hes not robert was never the rightful king either even renly said as much jaime lannister murdered the rightful king after robert killed his lawful heir on the trident where were the gods then the gods dont care about men no more than kings care about peasants a good king does care lord renly his grace he he would have been the best king my lady he was so good he he is gone brienne she said as gently as she could stannis and joffrey remain and so does my son he wouldnt youd never make a peace with stannis would you bend the knee you wouldnt i will tell you true brienne i do not know my son may be a king but i am no queen only a mother who would keep her children safe however she could i am not made to be a mother i need to fight then fight but for the living not the dead renlys enemies are robbs enemies as well brienne stared at the ground and shuffled her feet i do not know your son my lady she looked up i could serve you if you would have me catelyn was startled why me the question seemed to trouble brienne you helped me in the pavilion when they thought that i had thati had you were innocent even so you did not have to do that you could have let them kill me i was nothing to you perhaps i did not want to be the only one who knew the dark truth of what had happened there catelyn page thought brienne i have taken many wellborn ladies into my service over the years but never one like you i am no battle commander no but you have courage not battle courage perhaps but i dont know a kind of womans courage and i think when the time comes you will not try and hold me back promise me that that you will not hold me back from stannis catelyn could still hear stannis saying that robbs turn too would come in time it was like a cold breath on the back of her neck when the time comes i will not hold you back the tall girl knelt awkwardly unsheathed renlys longsword and laid it at her feet then i am yours my lady your liege man or whatever you would have me be i will shield your back and keep your counsel and give my life for yours if need be i swear it by the old gods and the new and i vow that you shall always have a place by my hearth and meat and mead at my table and pledge to ask no service of you that might bring you into dishonor i swear it by the old gods and the new arise as she clasped the other womans hands between her own catelyn could not help but smile how many times did i watch ned accept a mans oath of service she wondered what he would think if he could see her now they forded the red fork late the next day upstream of riverrun where the river made a wide loop and the waters grew muddy and shallow the crossing was guarded by a mixed force of archers and pikemen wearing the eagle badge of the mallisters when they saw catelyns banners they emerged from behind their sharpened stakes and sent a man over from the far bank to lead her party across slow and careful like milady he warned as he took the bridle of her horse weve planted iron spikes under the water ysee and theres caltrops scattered among them rocks there its the same on all the fords by your brothers command edmure thinks to fight here the realization gave her a queasy feeling in the bowels but she held her tongue between the red fork and the tumblestone they joined a stream of smallfolk making for the safety of riverrun some were driving animals before them others pulling wayns but they made way as catelyn rode past and cheered her with cries of tully or stark half a mile from the castle she passed through a large encampment where the scarlet banner of the blackwoods waved above the lords tent lucas took his leave of her there to seek out his father lord tytos the rest rode on catelyn spied a second camp strung out along the bank north of the tumblestone familiar standards flapping in the windmarq pipers dancing maiden darrys plowman the twining redandwhite snakes of the paeges they were all her fathers bannermen lords of the trident most had left riverrun before she had to defend their own lands if they were here again it could only mean that edmure had called them back gods save us its true he means to offer battle to lord tywin something dark was dangling against the walls of riverrun catelyn saw from a distance when she rode close she saw dead men hanging from the battlements slumped at the ends of long ropes with hempen nooses tight around their necks their faces swollen and black the crows had been at them but their crimson cloaks still showed bright against the sandstone walls they have hanged some lannisters hal mollen observed page a pretty sight ser wendel manderly said cheerfully our friends have begun without us perwyn frey jested the others laughed all but brienne who gazed up at the row of bodies unblinking and neither spoke nor smiled if they have slain the kingslayer then my daughters are dead as well catelyn spurred her horse to a canter hal mollen and robin flint raced past at a gallop halooing to the gatehouse the guards on the walls had doubtless spied her banners some time ago for the portcullis was up as they approached edmure rode out from the castle to meet her surrounded by three of her fathers sworn mengreatbellied ser desmond grell the masteratarms utherydes wayn the steward and ser robin ryger riverruns big bald captain of guards they were all three of an age with lord hoster men who had spent their lives in her fathers service old men catelyn realized edmure wore a blueandred cloak over a tunic embroidered with silver fish from the look of him he had not shaved since she rode south his beard was a fiery bush cat it is good to have you safely back when we heard of renlys death we feared for your life and lord tywin is on the march as well so i am told how fares our father one day he seems stronger the next he shook his head hes asked for you i did not know what to tell him i will go to him soon she vowed has there been word from storms end since renly died or from bitterbridge no ravens came to men on the road and catelyn was anxious to know what had happened behind her nothing from bitterbridge from storms end three birds from the castellan ser cortnay penrose all carrying the same plea stannis has him surrounded by land and sea he offers his allegiance to whatsoever king will break the siege he fears for the boy he says what boy would that be do you know edric storm brienne told them roberts bastard son edmure looked at her curiously stannis has sworn that the garrison might go free unharmed provided they yield the castle within the fortnight and deliver the boy into his hands but ser cortnay will not consent he risks all for a baseborn boy whose blood is not even his own catelyn thought did you send him an answer edmure shook his head why when we have neither help nor hope to offer and stannis is no enemy of ours ser robin ryger spoke my lady can you tell us the manner of lord renlys death the tales weve heard have been queer cat her brother said some say you killed renly others claim it was some southron woman his page glance lingered on brienne my king was murdered the girl said quietly and not by lady catelyn i swear it on my sword by the gods old and new this is brienne of tarth the daughter of lord selwyn the evenstar who served in renlys rainbow guard catelyn told them brienne i am honored to acquaint you with my brother ser edmure tully heir to riverrun his steward utherydes wayn ser robin ryger and ser desmond grell honored said ser desmond the others echoed him the girl flushed embarrassed even at this commonplace courtesy if edmure thought her a curious sort of lady at least he had the grace not to say so brienne was with renly when he was killed as was i said catelyn but we had no part in his death she did not care to speak of the shadow here in the open with men all around so she waved a hand at the bodies who are these men youve hanged edmure glanced up uncomfortably they came with ser cleos when he brought the queens answer to our peace offer catelyn was shocked youve killed envoys false envoys edmure declared they pledged me their peace and surrendered their weapons so i allowed them freedom of the castle and for three nights they ate my meat and drank my mead whilst i talked with ser cleos on the fourth night they tried to free the kingslayer he pointed up that big brute killed two guards with naught but those ham hands of his caught them by the throats and smashed their skulls together while that skinny lad beside him was opening lannisters cell with a bit of wire gods curse him the one on the end was some sort of damned mummer he used my own voice to command that the river gate be opened the guardsmen swear to it enger and delp and long lew all three if you ask me the man sounded nothing like me and yet the oafs were raising the portcullis all the same this was the imps work catelyn suspected it stank of the same sort of cunning he had displayed at the eyrie once she would have named tyrion the least dangerous of the lannisters now she was not so certain how is it you caught them ah as it happened i was not in the castle id crossed the tumblestone to ah you were whoring or wenching get on with the tale edmures cheeks flamed as red as his beard it was the hour before dawn and i was only then returning when long lew saw my boat and recognized me he finally thought to wonder who was standing below barking commands and raised a cry tell me the kingslayer was retaken yes though not easily jaime got hold of a sword slew poul pernford and ser desmonds squire myles and wounded delp so badly that maester vyman fears hell soon die as well it was a bloody mess at the sound of steel some of the other red cloaks rushed to join him barehand or no i hanged those beside the four who freed him and threw the rest in the dungeons jaime too well have no more escapes from that one hes down in the dark this time chained hand and foot and bolted to the wall page and cleos frey he swears he knew naught of the plot who can say the man is half lannister half frey and all liar i put him in jaimes old tower cell you say he brought terms if you can call them that youll like them no more than i did i promise can we hope for no help from the south lady stark asked utherydes wayn her fathers steward this charge of incest lord tywin does not suffer such slights lightly he will seek to wash the stain from his daughters name with the blood of her accuser lord stannis must see that he has no choice but to make common cause with us stannis has made common cause with a power greater and darker let us speak of these matters later catelyn trotted over the drawbridge putting the grisly row of dead lannisters behind her her brother kept pace as they rode out into the bustle of riverruns upper bailey a naked toddler ran in front of the horses catelyn jerked her reins hard to avoid him glancing about in dismay hundreds of smallfolk had been admitted to the castle and allowed to erect crude shelters against the walls their children were everywhere underfoot and the yard teemed with their cows sheep and chickens who are all these folk my people edmure answered they were afraid only my sweet brother would crowd all these useless mouths into a castle that might soon be under siege catelyn knew that edmure had a soft heart sometimes she thought his head was even softer she loved him for it yet still can robb be reached by raven hes in the field my lady ser desmond replied the bird would have no way to find him utherydes wayn coughed before he left us the young king instructed us to send you on to the twins upon your return lady stark he asks that you learn more of lord walders daughters to help him select his bride when the time comes well provide you with fresh mounts and provisions her brother promised youll want to refresh yourself before ill want to stay catelyn said dismounting she had no intention of leaving riverrun and her dying father to pick robbs wife for him robb wants me safe i cannot fault him for that but his pretext is growing threadbare boy she called and an urchin from the stables ran out to take the reins of her horse edmure swung down from his saddle he was a head taller than she was but he would always be her little brother cat he said unhappily lord tywin is coming he is making for the west to defend his own lands if we close our gates and shelter behind the walls we can watch him pass with safety page this is tully land edmure declared if tywin lannister thinks to cross it unbloodied i mean to teach him a hard lesson the same lesson you taught his son her brother could be stubborn as river rock when his pride was touched but neither of them was likely to forget how ser jaime had cut edmures host to bloody pieces the last time he had offered battle we have nothing to gain and everything to lose by meeting lord tywin in the field catelyn said tactfully the yard is not the place to discuss my battle plans as you will where shall we go her brothers face darkened for a moment she thought he was about to lose his temper with her but finally he snapped the godswood if you will insist she followed him along a gallery to the godswood gate edmures anger had always been a sulky sullen thing catelyn was sorry she had wounded him but the matter was too important for her to concern herself with his pride when they were alone beneath the trees edmure turned to face her you do not have the strength to meet the lannisters in the field she said bluntly when all my strength is marshaled i should have eight thousand foot and three thousand horse edmure said which means lord tywin will have near twice your numbers robbs won his battles against worse odds edmure replied and i have a plan youve forgotten roose bolton lord tywin defeated him on the green fork but failed to pursue when lord tywin went to han renhal bolton took the ruby ford and the crossroads he has ten thousand men ive sent word to helman tallhart to join him with the garrison robb left at the twins edmure robb left those men to hold the twins and make certain lord walder keeps faith with us he has edmure said stubbornly the freys fought bravely in the whispering wood and old ser stevron died at oxcross we hear ser ryman and black walder and the rest are with robb in the west martyn has been of great service scouting and ser perwyn helped see you safe to renly gods be good how much more can we ask of them robbs betrothed to one of lord walders daughters and roose bolton wed another i hear and havent you taken two of his grandsons to be fostered at winterfell a ward can easily become a hostage if need be she had not known that ser stevron was dead nor of boltons marriage if were two hostages to the good all the more reason lord walder dare not play us false bolton needs freys men and ser helmans as well ive commanded him to retake harrenhal thats like to be a bloody business yes but once the castle falls lord tywin will have no safe retreat my own levies will defend the fords of red fork against his crossing if he attacks across the river hell end as rhaegar did when he tried to page cross the trident if he holds back hell be caught between riverrun and harrenhal and when robb returns from the west we can finish him for good and all her brothers voice was full of brusque confidence but catelyn found herself wishing that robb had not taken her uncle brynden west with him the blackfish was the veteran of half a hundred battles edmure was the veteran of one and that one lost the plans a good one he concluded lord tytos says so and lord jonos as well when did blackwood and bracken agree about anything that was not certain i ask you be that as it may she was suddenly weary perhaps she was wrong to oppose him perhaps it was a splendid plan and her misgivings only a womans fears she wished ned were here or her uncle brynden or have you asked father about this father is in no state to weigh strategies two days ago he was making plans for your marriage to brandon stark go see him yourself if you do not believe me this plan will work cat youll see i hope so edmure i truly do she kissed him on the cheek to let him know she meant it and went to find her father lord hoster tully was much as she had left himabed haggard flesh pale and clammy the room smelled of sickness a cloying odor made up in equal parts of stale sweat and medicine when she pulled back the drapes her father gave a low moan and his eyes fluttered open he stared at her as if he could not comprehend who she was or what she wanted father she kissed him i am returned he seemed to know her then youve come he whispered faintly lips barely moving yes she said robb sent me south but i hurried back south where is the eyrie south sweetling i dont recall oh dear heart i was afraid have you forgiven me child tears ran down his cheeks youve done nothing that needs forgiveness father she stroked his limp white hair and felt his brow the fever still burned him from within despite all the maesters potions it was best her father whispered jons a good man good strong kind take care of you he will and well born listen to me you must im your father your father youll wed when cat does yes you will he thinks im lysa catelyn realized gods be good he talks as if we were not married yet her fathers hands clutched at hers fluttering like two frightened white birds that stripling wretched boy not speak that name to me your duty your mother she would lord hoster cried as a spasm of pain washed over him oh gods forgive me forgive me forgive me my medicine and then maester vyman was there holding a cup to his lips lord hoster sucked at the thick white page potion as eager as a babe at the breast and catelyn could see peace settle over him once more hell sleep now my lady the maester said when the cup was empty the milk of the poppy had left a thick white film around her fathers mouth maester vyman wiped it away with a sleeve catelyn could watch no more hoster tully had been a strong man and proud it hurt her to see him reduced to this she went out to the terrace the yard below was crowded with refugees and chaotic with their noises but beyond the walls the rivers flowed clean and pure and endless those are his rivers and soon he will return to them for his last voyage maester vyman had followed her out my lady he said softly i cannot keep the end at bay much longer we ought send a rider after his brother ser brynden would wish to be here yes catelyn said her voice thick with her grief and the lady lysa as well perhaps lysa will not come if you wrote her yourself perhaps i will put some words to paper if that please you she wondered who lysas wretched stripling had been some young squire or hedge knight like as not though by the vehemence with which lord hoster had opposed him he might have been a tradesmans son or baseborn apprentice even a singer lysa had always been too fond of singers i must not blame her ion arryn was twenty years older than our father however noble the tower her brother had set aside for her use was the very same that she and lysa had shared as maids it would feel good to sleep on a featherbed again with a warm fire in the hearth when she was rested the world would seem less bleak but outside her chambers she found utherydes wayn waiting with two women clad in grey their faces cowled save for their eyes catelyn knew at once why they were here ned the sisters lowered their gaze utherydes said ser cleos brought him from kings landing my lady take me to him she commanded they had laid him out on a trestle table and covered him with a banner the white banner of house stark with its grey direwolf sigil i would look on him catelyn said only the bones remain my lady i would look on him she repeated one of the silent sisters turned down the banner bones catelyn thought this is not ned this is not the man i loved the father of my children his hands were clasped together over his chest skeletal fingers curled about the hilt of some longsword but they were not neds hands so strong and full of life they had dressed the bones in neds surcoat the fine white velvet with the direwolf badge over the heart but nothing remained of the warm flesh that had pillowed her head so many nights the arms that had held her the head had been rejoined to the body page with fine silver wire but one skull looks much like another and in those empty hollows she found no trace of her lords dark grey eyes eyes that could be soft as a fog or hard as stone they gave his eyes to crows she remembered catelyn turned away that is not his sword ice was not returned to us my lady utherydes said only lord eddards bones i suppose i must thank the queen for even that much thank the imp my lady it was his doing one day i will thank them all i am grateful for your service sisters catelyn said but i must lay another task upon you lord eddard was a stark and his bones must be laid to rest beneath winterfell they will make a statue of him a stone likeness that will sit in the dark with a direwolf at his feet and a sword across his knees make certain the sisters have fresh horses and aught else they need for the journey she told utherydes wayn hal mollen will escort them back to winterfell it is his place as captain of guards she gazed down at the bones that were all that remained of her lord and love now leave me all of you i would be alone with ned tonight the women in grey bowed their heads the silent sisters do not speak to the living catelyn remembered dully but some say they can talk to the dead and how she envied that chapter daenerys the drapes kept out the dust and heat of the streets but they could not keep out disappointment dany climbed inside wearily glad for the refuge from the sea of qartheen eyes make way jhogo shouted at the crowd from horseback snapping his whip make way make way for the mother of dragons reclining on cool satin cushions xaro xhoan daxos poured rubyred wine into matched goblets of jade and gold his hands sure and steady despite the sway of the palanquin i see a deep sadness written upon your face my light of love he offered her a goblet could it be the sadness of a lost dream a dream delayed no more danys tight silver collar was chafing against her throat she unfastened it and flung it aside the collar was set with an enchanted amethyst that xaro swore would ward her against all poisons the pureborn were notorious for offering poisoned wine to those they thought dangerous but they had not given dany so much as a cup of water they never saw me for a queen she thought bitterly i was only an afternoons amusement a horse girl with a curious pet rhaegal hissed and dug sharp black claws into her bare shoulder as dany stretched out a hand for the wine wincing she shifted him to her other shoulder where he could claw her gown instead of her skin she was garbed after the qartheen fashion xaro had warned her that the enthroned would never listen to a dothraki so she had taken care to go before them in flowing green samite with one breast bared silvered page sandals on her feet with a belt of blackandwhite pearls about her waist for all the help they offered i could have gone naked perhaps i should have she drank deep descendants of the ancient kings and queens of qarth the pureborn commanded the civic guard and the fleet of ornate galleys that ruled the straits between the seas daenerys targaryen had wanted that fleet or part of it and some of their soldiers as well she made the traditional sacrifice in the temple of memory offered the traditional bribe to the keeper of the long list sent the traditional persimmon to the opener of the door and finally received the traditional blue silk slippers summoning her to the hall of a thousand thrones the pureborn heard her pleas from the great wooden seats of their ancestors rising in curved tiers from a marble floor to a highdomed ceiling painted with scenes of qarths vanished glory the chairs were immense fantastically carved bright with goldwork and studded with amber onyx lapis and jade each one different from all the others and each striving to be the most fabulous yet the men who sat in them seemed so listless and worldweary that they might have been asleep they listened but they did not hear or care she thought they are milk men indeed they never meant to help me they came because they were curious they came because they were bored and the dragon on my shoulder interested them more than i did tell me the words of the pureborn prompted xaro xhoan daxos tell me what they said to sadden the queen of my heart they said no the wine tasted of pomegranates and hot summer days they said it with great courtesy to be sure but under all the lovely words it was still no did you flatter them shamelessly did you weep the blood of the dragon does not weep she said testily xaro sighed you ought to have wept the qartheen wept often and easily it was considered a mark of the civilized man the men we bought what did they say mathos said nothing wendello praised the way i spoke the exquisite refused me with the rest but he wept afterward alas that qartheen should be so faithless xaro was not himself of the pureborn but he had told her whom to bribe and how much to offer weep weep for the treachery of men dany would sooner have wept for her gold the bribes shed tendered to mathos mallarawan wendello qar deeth and egon emeros the exquisite might have bought her a ship or hired a score of sellswords suppose i sent ser jorah to demand the return of my gifts she asked suppose a sorrowful man came to my palace one night and killed you as you slept said xaro the sorrowful men were an ancient sacred guild of assassins so named because they always whispered i am so sorry to their victims before they killed them the qartheen were nothing if not polite it is wisely said that it is easier to milk the stone cow of faros than to wring gold from the pureborn page dany did not know where faros was but it seemed to her that qarth was full of stone cows the merchant princes grown vastly rich off the trade between the seas were divided into three jealous factions the ancient guild of spicers the tourmaline brotherhood and the thirteen to which xaro belonged each vied with the others for dominance and all three contended endlessly with the pureborn and brooding over all were the warlocks with their blue lips and dread powers seldom seen but much feared she would have been lost without xaro the gold that she had squandered to open the doors of the hall of a thousand thrones was largely a product of the merchants generosity and quick wits as the rumor of living dragons had spread through the east ever more seekers had come to learn if the tale was trueand xaro xhoan daxos saw to it that the great and the humble alike offered some token to the mother of dragons the trickle he started soon swelled to a flood trader captains brought lace from myr chests of saffron from yi ti amber and dragonglass out of asshai merchants offered bags of coin silversmiths rings and chains pipers piped for her tumblers tumbled and jugglers juggled while dyers draped her in colors she had never known existed a pair of jogos nhai presented her with one of their striped zorses black and white and fierce a widow brought the dried corpse of her husband covered with a crust of silvered leaves such remnants were believed to have great power especially if the deceased had been a sorcerer as this one had and the tourmaline brotherhood pressed on her a crown wrought in the shape of a threeheaded dragon the coils were yellow gold the wings silver the heads carved from jade ivory and onyx the crown was the only offering shed kept the rest she sold to gather the wealth she had wasted on the pureborn xaro would have sold the crown toothe thirteen would see that she had a much finer one he sworebut dany forbade it viserys sold my mothers crown and men called him a beggar i shall keep this one so men will call me a queen and so she did though the weight of it made her neck ache yet even crowned i am a beggar still dany thought i have become the most splendid beggar in the world but a beggar all the same she hated it as her brother must have all those years of running from city to city one step ahead of the usurpers knives pleading for help from archons and princes and magisters buying our food with flattery he must have known how they mocked him small wonder he turned so angry and bitter in the end it had driven him mad it will do the same to me if i let it part of her would have liked nothing more than to lead her people back to vaes tolorro and make the dead city bloom no that is defeat i have something viserys never had i have the dragons the dragons are all the difference she stroked rhaegal the green dragon closed his teeth around the meat of her hand and nipped hard outside the great city murmured and thrummed and seethed all its myriad voices blending into one low sound like the surge of the sea make way you milk men make way for the mother of dragons jhogo cried and the qartheen moved aside though perhaps the oxen had more to do with that than his voice through the swaying draperies dany caught glimpses of him astride his grey stallion from time to time he gave one of the oxen a flick with the silverhandled whip she had given him aggo guarded on her other side while rakharo rode behind the procession watching the faces in the crowd for any sign of danger ser jorah she had left behind today to guard her other dragons the exile knight had been opposed to this folly from the start he distrusts everyone she reflected and perhaps for good reason as dany lifted her goblet to drink rhaegal sniffed at the wine and drew his head back hissing your dragon has a good nose xaro wiped his lips the wine is ordinary it is said that across the jade sea page they make a golden vintage so fine that one sip makes all other wines taste like vinegar let us take my pleasure barge and go in search of it you and i the arbor makes the best wine in the world dany declared lord redwyne had fought for her father against the usurper she remembered one of the few to remain true to the last will he fight for me as well there was no way to be certain after so many years come with me to the arbor xaro and youll have the finest vintages you ever tasted but well need to go in a warship not a pleasure barge i have no warships war is bad for trade many times i have told you xaro xhoan daxos is a man of peace xaro xhoan daxos is a man of gold she thought and gold will buy me all the ships and swords i need i have not asked you to take up a sword only to lend me your ships he smiled modestly of trading ships i have a few that is so who can say how many one may be sinking even now in some stormy corner of the summer sea on the morrow another will fall afoul of corsairs the next day one of my captains may look at the wealth in his hold and think all this should belong to me such are the perils of trade why the longer we talk the fewer ships i am likely to have i grow poorer by the instant give me ships and i will make you rich again marry me bright light and sail the ship of my heart i cannot sleep at night for thinking of your beauty dany smiled xaros flowery protestations of passion amused her but his manner was at odds with his words while ser jorah had scarcely been able to keep his eyes from her bare breast when hed helped her into the palanquin xaro hardly deigned to notice it even in these close confines and she had seen the beautiful boys who surrounded the merchant prince flitting through his palace halls in wisps of silk you speak sweetly xaro but under your words i hear another no this iron throne you speak of sounds monstrous cold and hard i cannot bear the thought of jagged barbs cutting your sweet skin the jewels in xaros nose gave him the aspect of some strange glittery bird his long elegant fingers waved dismissal let this be your kingdom most exquisite of queens and let me be your king i will give you a throne of gold if you like when qarth begins to pall we can journey round yi ti and search for the dreaming city of the poets to sip the wine of wisdom from a dead mans skull i mean to sail to westeros and drink the wine of vengeance from the skull of the usurper she scratched rhaegal under one eye and his jadegreen wings unfolded for a moment stirring the still air in the palanquin a single perfect tear ran down the cheek of xaro xhoan daxos will nothing turn you from this madness nothing she said wishing she was as certain as she sounded if each of the thirteen would lend me ten ships you would have one hundred thirty ships and no crew to sail them the justice of your cause means naught to the common men of qarth why should my sailors care who sits upon the throne of some kingdom at the edge of the world page i will pay them to care with what coin sweet star of my heaven with the gold the seekers bring that you may do xaro acknowledged but so much caring will cost dear you will need to pay them far more than i do and all of qarth laughs at my ruinous generosity if the thirteen will not aid me perhaps i should ask the guild of spicers or the tourmaline brotherhood xaro gave a languid shrug they will give you nothing but flattery and lies the spicers are dissemblers and braggarts and the brotherhood is full of pirates then i must heed pyat free and go to the warlocks the merchant prince sat up sharply pyat pree has blue lips and it is truly said that blue lips speak only lies heed the wisdom of one who loves you warlocks are bitter creatures who eat dust and drink of shadows they will give you naught they have naught to give i would not need to seek sorcerous help if my friend xaro xhoan daxos would give me what i ask i have given you my home and heart do they mean nothing to you i have given you perfume and pomegranates tumbling monkeys and spitting snakes scrolls from lost valyria an idols head and a serpents foot i have given you this palanquin of ebony and gold and a matched set of bullocks to bear it one white as ivory and one black as jet with horns inlaid with jewels yes dany said but it was ships and soldiers i wanted did i not give you an army sweetest of women a thousand knights each in shining armor the armor had been made of silver and gold the knights of jade and beryl and onyx and tourmaline of amber and opal and amethyst each as tall as her little finger a thousand lovely knights she said but not the sort my enemies need fear and my bullocks cannot carry me across the water iwhy are we stopping the oxen had slowed notably khaleesi aggo called through the drapes as the palanquin jerked to a sudden halt dany rolled onto an elbow to lean out they were on the fringes of the bazaar the way ahead blocked by a solid wall of people what are they looking at jhogo rode back to her a firemage khaleesi i want to sec then you must the dothraki offered a hand down when she took it he pulled her up onto his horse and sat her in front of him where she could see over the heads of the crowd the firemage had conjured a ladder in the air a crackling orange ladder of swirling flame that rose unsupported from the floor of the bazaar reaching toward the high latticed roof page most of the spectators she noticed were not of the city she saw sailors off trading ships merchants come by caravan dusty men out of the red waste wandering soldiers craftsmen slavers jhogo slid one hand about her waist and leaned close the milk men shun him khaleesi do you see the girl in the felt hat there behind the fat priest she is a cutpurse finished dany she was no pampered lady blind to such things she had seen cutpurses aplenty in the streets of the free cities during the years shed spent with her brother running from the usurpers hired knives the mage was gesturing urging the flames higher and higher with broad sweeps of his arms as the watchers craned their necks upward the cutpurses squirmed through the press small blades hidden in their palms they relieved the prosperous of their coin with one hand while pointing upward with the other when the fiery ladder stood forty feet high the mage leapt forward and began to climb it scrambling up hand over hand as quick as a monkey each rung he touched dissolved behind him leaving no more than a wisp of silver smoke when he reached the top the ladder was gone and so was he a fine trick announced jhogo with admiration no trick a woman said in the common tongue dany had not noticed quaithe in the crowd yet there she stood eyes wet and shiny behind the implacable red lacquer mask what mean you my lady half a year gone that man could scarcely wake fire from dragonglass he had some small skill with powders and wildfire sufficient to entrance a crowd while his cutpurses did their work he could walk across hot coals and make burning roses bloom in the air but he could no more aspire to climb the fiery ladder than a common fisherman could hope to catch a kraken in his nets dany looked uneasily at where the ladder had stood even the smoke was gone now and the crowd was breaking up each man going about his business in a moment more than a few would find their purses flat and empty and now and now his powers grow khaleesi and you are the cause of it me she laughed how could that be the woman stepped closer and lay two fingers on danys wrist you are the mother of dragons are you not she is and no spawn of shadows may touch her jhogo brushed quaithes fingers away with the handle of his whip the woman took a step backward you must leave this city soon daenerys targaryen or you will never be permitted to leave it at all danys wrist still tingled where quaithe had touched her where would you have me go she asked to go north you must journey south to reach the west you must go east to go forward you must go page back and to touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow asshai dany thought she would have me go to asshai will the asshaii give me an army she demanded will there be gold for me in asshai will there be ships what is there in asshai that i will not find in qarth truth said the woman in the mask and bowing she faded back into the crowd rakharo snorted contempt through his drooping black mustachios khaleesi better a man should swallow scorpions than trust in the spawn of shadows who dare not show their face beneath the sun it is known it is known aggo agreed xaro xhoan daxos had watched the whole exchange from his cushions when dany climbed back into the palanquin beside him he said your savages are wiser than they know such truths as the asshaii hoard are not like to make you smile then he pressed another cup of wine on her and spoke of love and lust and other trifles all the way back to his manse in the quiet of her chambers dany stripped off her finery and donned a loose robe of purple silk her dragons were hungry so she chopped up a snake and charred the pieces over a brazier they are growing she realized as she watched them snap and squabble over the blackened flesh they must weigh twice what they had in vaes tolorro even so it would be years before they were large enough to take to war and they must be trained as well or they will lay my kingdom waste for all her targaryen blood dany had not the least idea of how to train a dragon ser jorah mormont came to her as the sun was going down the pureborn refused you as you said they would come sit give me your counsel dany drew him down to the cushions beside her and jhiqui brought them a bowl of purple olives and onions drowned in wine you will get no help in this city khaleesi ser jorah took an onion between thumb and forefinger each day i am more convinced of that than the day before the pureborn see no farther than the walls of qarth and xaro he asked me to marry him again yes and i know why when the knight frowned his heavy black brows joined together above his deepset eyes he dreams of me day and night she laughed forgive me my queen but it is your dragons he dreams of xaro assures me that in qarth man and woman each retain their own property after they are wed the dragons are mine she smiled as drogon came hopping and flapping across the marble floor to crawl up on the cushion beside her he tells it true as far as it goes but theres one thing he failed to mention the qartheen have a curious wedding custom my queen on the day of their union a wife may ask a token of love from her husband whatsoever she desires of his worldly goods he must grant and he may ask the same of her one thing page only may be asked but whatever is named may not be denied one thing she repeated and it may not be denied with one dragon xaro xhoan daxos would rule this city but one ship will further our cause but little dany nibbled at an onion and reflected ruefully on the faithlessness of men we passed through the bazaar on our way back from the hall of a thousand thrones she told ser jorah quaithe was there she told him of the firemage and the fiery ladder and what the woman in the red mask had told her i would be glad to leave this city if truth be told the knight said when she was done but not for asshai where then east he said i am half a world away from my kingdom even here if i go any farther east i may never find my way home to westeros if you go west you risk your life house targaryen has friends in the free cities she reminded him truer friends than xaro or the pureborn if you mean illyrio mopatis i wonder for sufficient gold illyrio would sell you as quickly as he would a slave my brother and i were guests in illyrios manse for half a year if he meant to sell us he could have done it then he did sell you ser jorah said to khal drogo dany flushed he had the truth of it but she did not like the sharpness with which he put it illyrio protected us from the usurpers knives and he believed in my brothers cause illyrio believes in no cause but illyrio gluttons are greedy men as a rule and magisters are devious illyrio mopatis is both what do you truly know of him i know that he gave me my dragon eggs he snorted if hed known they were like to hatch hed would have sat on them himself that made her smile despite herself oh i have no doubt of that ser i know illyrio better than you think i was a child when i left his manse in pentos to wed my sunandstars but i was neither deaf nor blind and i am no child now even if illyrio is the friend you think him the knight said stubbornly he is not powerful enough to enthrone you by himself no more than he could your brother he is rich she said not so rich as xaro perhaps but rich enough to hire ships for me and men as page well sellswords have their uses ser jorah admitted but you will not win your fathers throne with sweepings from the free cities nothing knits a broken realm together so quick as an invading army on its soil i am their rightful queen dany protested you are a stranger who means to land on their shores with an army of outlanders who cannot even speak the common tongue the lords of westeros do not know you and have every reason to fear and mistrust you you must win them over before you sail a few at least and how am i to do that if i go east as you counsel he ate an olive and spit out the pit into his palm i do not know your grace he admitted but i do know that the longer you remain in one place the easier it will be for your enemies to find you the name targaryen still frightens them so much so that they sent a man to murder you when they heard you were with child what will they do when they learn of your dragons drogon was curled up beneath her arm as hot as a stone that has soaked all day in the blazing sun rhaegal and viserion were fighting over a scrap of meat buffeting each other with their wings as smoke hissed from their nostrils my furious children she thought they must not come to harm the comet led me to qarth for a reason i had hoped to find my army here but it seems that will not be what else remains i ask myself i am afraid she realized but i must be brave come the morrow you must go to pyat pree chapter tyrion the girl never wept young as she was myrcella baratheon was a princess born and a lannister despite her name tyrion reminded himself as much faimes blood as cerseis to be sure her smile was a shade tremulous when her brothers took their leave of her on the deck of the seaswift but the girl knew the proper words to say and she said them with courage and dignity when the time came to part it was prince tornmen who cried and myrcella who gave him comfort tyrion looked down upon the farewells from the high deck of king roberts hammer a great war galley of four hundred oars robs hammer as her oarsmen called her would form the main strength of myrcellas escort lionstar bold wind and lady lyanna would sail with her as well it made tyrion more than a little uneasy to detach so great a part of their already inadequate fleet depleted as it was by the loss of all those ships that had sailed with lord stannis to dragonstone and never returned but cersei would hear of nothing less perhaps she was wise if the girl was captured before she reached sunspear the dornish alliance would fall to pieces so far doran martell had done no more than call his banners once myrcella was safe in braavos he had pledged to move his strength to the high passes where the threat might make some of the marcher lords rethink their loyalties and give page stannis pause about marching north it was purely a feint however the martells would not commit to actual battle unless dorne itself was attacked and stannis was not so great a fool though some of his bannermen may be tyrion reflected i should think on that he cleared his throat you know your orders captain i do my lord we are to follow the coast staying always in sight of land until we reach crackclaw point from there we are to strike out across the narrow sea for braavos on no account are we to sail within sight of dragonstone and if our foes should chance upon you nonetheless if a single ship we are to run them off or destroy them if there are more the bold wind will cleave to the seaswift to protect her while the rest of the fleet does battle tyrion nodded if the worst happened the little seaswift ought to be able to outrun pursuit a small ship with big sails she was faster than any warship afloat or so her captain had claimed once myrcella reached braavos she ought to be safe he was sending ser arys oakheart as her sworn shield and had engaged the braavosi to bring her the rest of the way to sunspear even lord stannis would hesitate to wake the anger of the greatest and most powerful of the free cities traveling from kings landing to dorne by way of braavos was scarcely the most direct of routes but it was the safest or so he hoped if lord stannis knew of this sailing he could not choose a better time to send his fleet against us tyrion glanced back to where the rush emptied out into blackwater bay and was relieved to see no signs of sails on the wide green horizon at last report the baratheon fleet still lay off storms end where ser cortnay penrose continued to defy the besiegers in dead renlys name meanwhile tyrions winch towers stood threequarters complete even now men were hoisting heavy blocks of stone into place no doubt cursing him for making them work through the festivities let them curse another fortnight stannis thats all i require another fortnight and it will be done tyrion watched his niece kneel before the high septon to receive his blessing on her voyage sunlight caught in his crystal crown and spilled rainbows across myrcellas upturned face the noise from the riverside made it impossible to hear the prayers he hoped the gods had sharper ears the high septon was as fat as a house and more pompous and long of wind than even pycelle enough old man make an end to it tyrion thought irritably the gods have better things to do than listen to you and so do i when at last the droning and mumbling was done tyrion took his farewell of the captain of robs hammer deliver my niece safely to braavos and there will be a knighthood waiting for you on your return he promised as he made his way down the steep plank to the quay tyrion could feel unkind eyes upon him the galley rocked gently and the movement underfoot made his waddle worse than ever ill wager theyd love to snigger no one dared not openly though he heard mutterings mingled with the creak of wood and rope and the rush of the river around the pilings they do not love me he thought well small wonder im well fed and ugly and they are starving bronn escorted him through the crowd to join his sister and her sons cersei ignored him preferring to lavish her smiles on their cousin he watched her charming lancel with eyes as green as the rope of emeralds around her slim white throat and smiled a small sly smile to himself i know your secret cersei page he thought his sister had oft called upon the high septon of late to seek the blessings of the gods in their coming struggle with lord stannis or so she would have him believe in truth after a brief call at the great sept of baelor cersei would don a plain brown travelers cloak and steal off to meet a certain hedge knight with the unlikely name of ser osmund kettleblack and his equally unsavory brothers osney and osfryd lancel had told him all about them cersei meant to use the kettleblacks to buy her own force of sellswords well let her enjoy her plots she was much sweeter when she thought she was outwitting him the kettleblacks would charm her take her coin and promise her anything she asked and why not when bronn was matching every copper penny coin for coin amiable rogues all three the brothers were in truth much more skilled at deceit than theyd ever been at bloodletting cersei had managed to buy herself three hollow drums they would make all the fierce booming sounds she required but there was nothing inside it amused tyrion no end horns blew fanfares as lionstar and lady lyanna pushed out from shore moving downriver to clear the way for seaswift a few cheers went up from the crush along the banks as thin and ragged as the clouds scuttling overhead myrcella smiled and waved from the deck behind her stood arys oakheart his white cloak streaming the captain ordered lines cast off and oars pushed the seaswift out into the lusty current of the blackwater rush where her sails blossomed in the windcommon white sails as tyrion had insisted not sheets of lannister crimson prince tornmen sobbed you mew like a suckling babe his brother hissed at him princes arent supposed to cry prince aemon the dragonknight cried the day princess naerys wed his brother aegon sansa stark said and the twins ser arryk and ser erryk died with tears on their cheeks after each had given the other a mortal wound be quiet or ill have ser meryn give you a mortal wound joffrey told his betrothed tyrion glanced at his sister but cersei was engrossed in something ser balon swann was telling her can she truly be so blind as to what he is he wondered out on the river bold wind unshipped her oars and glided downstream in the wake of seaswift last came king roberts hammer the might of the royal fleet or at least that portion that had not fled to dragonstone last year with stannis tyrion had chosen the ships with care avoiding any whose captains might be of doubtful loyalty according to varys but as varys himself was of doubtful loyalty a certain amount of apprehension remained i rely too much on varys he reflected i need my own informers not that id trust them either trust would get you killed he wondered again about littlefinger there had been no word from petyr baelish since he had ridden off for bitterbridge that might mean nothingor everything even varys could not say the eunuch had suggested that perhaps littlefinger had met some misfortune on the roads he might even be slain tyrion had snorted in derision if littlefinger is dead then im a giant more likely the tyrells were balking at the proposed marriage tyrion could scarcely blame them if i were mace rell i would sooner have loffreys head on a pike than his cock in my daughter the little fleet was well out into the bay when cersei indicated that it was time to go bronn brought tyrions horse and helped him mount that was podrick paynes task but they had left pod back at the red keep the gaunt sellsword made for a much more reassuring presence than the boy would have the narrow streets were lined by men of the city watch holding back the crowd with the shafts of their spears ser jacelyn bywater went in front heading a wedge of mounted lancers in black ringmail and page golden cloaks behind him came ser aron santagar and ser balon swann bearing the kings banners the lion of lannister and crowned stag of baratheon king joffrey followed on a tall grey palfrey a golden crown set upon his golden curls sansa stark rode a chesnut mare at his side looking neither right nor left her thick auburn hair flowing to her shoulders beneath a net of moonstones two of the kingsguard flanked the couple the hound on the kings right hand and ser mandon moore to the left of the stark girl next came tommen snuffling with ser preston greenfield in his white armor and cloak and then cersei accompanied by ser lancel and protected by meryn trant and boros blount tyrion fell in with his sister after them followed the high septon in his litter and a long tail of other courtiersser horas redwyne lady tanda and her daughter jalabhar xho lord gyles rosby and the rest a double column of guardsmen brought up the rear the unshaven and the unwashed stared at the riders with dull resentment from behind the line of spears i like this not one speck tyrion thought bronn had a score of sellswords scattered through the crowd with orders to stop any trouble before it started perhaps cersei had similarly disposed her kettleblacks somehow tyrion did not think it would help much if the fire was too hot you could hardly keep the pudding from scorching by tossing a handful of raisins in the pot they crossed fishmongers square and rode along muddy way before turning onto the narrow curving hook to begin their climb up aegons high hill a few voices raised a cry of loffrey all hail all hail as the young king rode by but for every man who picked up the shout a hundred kept their silence the larmisters moved through a sea of ragged men and hungry women breasting a tide of sullen eyes just ahead of him cersei was laughing at something lancel had said though he suspected her merriment was feigned she could not be oblivious to the unrest around them but his sister always believed in putting on the brave show halfway along the route a wailing woman forced her way between two watchmen and ran out into the street in front of the king and his companions holding the corpse of her dead baby above her head it was blue and swollen grotesque but the real horror was the mothers eyes joffrey looked for a moment as if he meant to ride her down but sansa stark leaned over and said something to him the king fumbled in his purse and flung the woman a silver stag the coin bounced off the child and rolled away under the legs of the gold cloaks and into the crowd where a dozen men began to fight for it the mother never once blinked her skinny arms were trembling from the dead weight of her son leave her your grace cersei called out to the king shes beyond our help poor thing the mother heard her somehow the queens voice cut through the womans ravaged wits her slack face twisted in loathing whore she shrieked kingslayers whore brotherfucker her dead child dropped from her arms like a sack of flour as she pointed at cersei brotherfucker brotherfucker brotherfucker tyrion never saw who threw the dung he only heard sansas gasp and joffreys bellowed curse and when he turned his head the king was wiping brown filth from his cheek there was more caked in his golden hair and spattered over sansas legs who threw that joffrey screamed he pushed his fingers into his hair made a furious face and flung away another handful of dung i page want the man who threw that he shouted a hundred golden dragons to the man who gives him up he was up there someone shouted from the crowd the king wheeled his horse in a circle to survey the rooftops and open balconies above them in the crowd people were pointing shoving cursing one another and the king please your grace let him go sansa pleaded the king paid her no heed bring me the man who flung that filth joffrey commanded hell lick it off me or ill have his head dog you bring him here obedient sandor clegane swung down from his saddle but there was no way through that wall of flesh let alone to the roof those closest to him began to squirm and shove to get away while others pushed forward to see tyrion smelled disaster clegane leave off the man is long fled i want him joffrey pointed at the roof he was up there dog cut through them and bring a tumult of sound drowned his last words a rolling thunder of rage and fear and hatred that engulfed them from all sides bastard someone screamed at joffrey bastard monster other voices flung calls of whore and brotherfucker at the queen while tyrion was pelted with shouts of freak and halfman mixed in with the abuse he heard a few cries of justice and robb king robb the young wolf of stannis and even renly from both sides of the street the crowd surged against the spear shafts while the gold cloaks struggled to hold the line stones and dung and fouler things whistled overhead feed us a woman shrieked bread boomed a man behind her we want bread bastard in a heartbeat a thousand voices took up the chant king joffrey and king robb and king stannis were forgotten and king bread ruled alone bread they clamored bread bread tyrion spurred to his sisters side yelling back to the castle now cersei gave a curt nod and ser lancel unsheathed his sword ahead of the column jacelyn bywater was roaring commands his riders lowered their lances and drove forward in a wedge the king was wheeling his palfrey around in anxious circles while hands reached past the line of gold cloaks grasping for him one managed to get hold of his leg but only for an instant ser mandons sword slashed down parting hand from wrist ride tyrion shouted at his nephew giving the horse a sharp smack on the rump the animal reared trumpeting and plunged ahead the press shattering before him tyrion drove into the gap hard on the kings hooves bronn kept pace sword in hand a jagged rock flew past his head as he rode and a rotten cabbage exploded against ser mandons shield to their left three gold cloaks went down under the surge and then the crowd was rushing forward trampling the fallen men the hound had vanished behind though his riderless horse galloped beside them tyrion saw aron santagar pulled from the saddle the goldandblack baratheon stag torn from his grasp ser balon swann dropped the lannister lion to draw his longsword he slashed right and left as the fallen banner was ripped apart the thousand ragged pieces swirling away like crimson leaves in a stormwind in an instant they were gone someone staggered in front of joffreys horse and shrieked as the king rode him down whether it had been man woman or child tyrion could not have said joffrey was galloping at his side wheyfaced with ser mandon moore a white shadow on his left and suddenly the madness was behind and they were clattering across the cobbled square that fronted on the castle barbican a line of spearmen held the gates ser jacelyn was wheeling his lances around for another charge the spears parted to let the kings party pass under the portcullis pale red walls loomed page up about them reassuringly high and aswarm with crossbowmen tyrion did not recall dismounting ser mandon was helping the shaken king off his horse when cersei tommen and lancel rode through the gates with ser meryn and ser boros close behind boros had blood smeared along his blade while meryns white cloak had been torn from his back ser balon swann rode in helmetless his mount lathered and bleeding at the mouth horas redwyne brought in lady tanda half crazed with fear for her daughter lollys who had been knocked from the saddle and left behind lord gyles more grey of face than ever stammered out a tale of seeing the high septon spilled from his litter screeching prayers as the crowd swept over him jalabhar xho said he thought hed seen ser preston greenfield of the kingsguard riding back toward the high septons overturned litter but he was not certain tyrion was dimly aware of a maester asking if he was injured he pushed his way across the yard to where his nephew stood his dungencrusted crown askew traitors joffrey was babbling excitedly ill have all their heads ill the dwarf slapped his flushed face so hard the crown flew from joffreys head then he shoved him with both hands and knocked him sprawling you blind bloody fool they were traitors joffrey squealed from the ground they called me names and attacked me you set your dog on them what did you imagine they would do bend the knee meekly while the hound lopped off some limbs you spoiled witless little boy youve killed clegane and gods know how many more and yet you come through unscratched damn you and he kicked him it felt so good he might have done more but ser mandon moore pulled him off as joffrey howled and then bronn was there to take him in hand cersei knelt over her son while ser balon swann restrained ser lancel tyrion wrenched free of bronns grip how many are still out there he shouted to no one and everyone my daughter cried lady tanda please someone must go back for lollys ser preston is not returned ser boros blount reported nor aron santagar nor wet nurse said ser horas redwyne that was the mocking name the other squires had hung on young tyrek lannister tyrion glanced round the yard wheres the stark girl for a moment no one answered finally joffrey said she was riding by me i dont know where she went tyrion pressed blunt fingers into his throbbing temples if sansa stark had come to harm jaime was as good as dead ser mandon you were her shield ser mandon moore remained untroubled when they mobbed the hound i thought first of the king and rightly so cersei put in boros meryn go back and find the girl and my daughter lady tanda sobbed please sers page ser boros did not look pleased at the prospect of leaving the safety of the castle your grace he told the queen the sight of our white cloaks might enrage the mob tyrion had stomached all he cared to the others take your fucking cloaks take them off if youre afraid to wear them you bloody oaf but find me sansa stark or i swear ill have shagga split that ugly head of yours in two to see if theres anything inside but black pudding ser boros went purple with rage you would call me ugly you he started to raise the bloody sword still clutched in his mailed fist bronn shoved tyrion unceremoniously behind him stop it cersei snapped boros youll do as youre bid or well find someone else to wear that cloak your oath there she is joffrey shouted pointing sandor clegane cantered briskly through the gates astride sansas chestnut courser the girl was seated behind both arms tight around the hounds chest tyrion called to her are you hurt lady sansa blood was trickling down sansas brow from a deep gash on her scalp they they were throwing things rocks and filth eggs i tried to tell them i had no bread to give them a man tried to pull me from the saddle the hound killed him i think his arm her eyes widened and she put a hand over her mouth he cut off his arm clegane lifted her to the ground his white cloak was torn and stained and blood seeped through a jagged tear in his left sleeve the little birds bleeding someone take her back to her cage and see to that cut maester frenken scurried forward to obey they did for santagar the hound continued four men held him down and took turns bashing at his head with a cobblestone i gutted one not that it did ser aron much good lady tanda approached him my daughter never saw her the hound glanced around the yard scowling wheres my horse if anythings happened to that horse someones going to pay he was running with us for a time tyrion said but i dont know what became of him after that fire a voice screamed down from atop the barbican my lords theres smoke in the city flea bottoms afire tyrion was inutterably weary but there was no time for despair bronn take as many men as you need and see that the water wagons are not molested gods be good the wildfire if any blaze should reach that we can lose all of flea bottom if we must but on no account must the fire reach the guildhall of the alchemists is that understood clegane youll go with him for half a heartbeat tyrion thought he glimpsed fear in the hounds dark eyes fire he realized the others take me of course he hates flre hes tasted it too well the look was gone in an instant replaced by cleganes familiar scowl ill go he said though not by your command i need to find that horse page tyrion turned to the three remaining knights of the kingsguard each of you will ride escort to a herald command the people to return to their homes any man found on the streets after the last peal of the evenfall bell will be killed our place is beside the king ser meryn said complacent cersei reared up like a viper your place is where my brother says it is she spit the hand speaks with the kings own voice and disobedience is treason boros and meryn exchanged a look should we wear our cloaks your grace ser boros asked go naked for all i care it might remind the mob that youre men theyre like to have forgotten after seeing the way you behaved out there in the street tyrion let his sister rage his head was throbbing he thought he could smell smoke though perhaps it was just the scent of his nerves fraying two of the stone crows guarded the door of the tower of the hand find me timett son of timett stone crows do not run squeaking after burned men one of the wildlings informed him haughtily for a moment tyrion had forgotten who he was dealing with then find me shagga shagga sleeps it was an effort not to scream wake him it is no easy thing to wake shagga son of dolf the man complained his wrath is fearsome he went off grumbling the clansman wandered in yawning and scratching half the city is rioting the other half is burning and shagga lies snoring tyrion said shagga mislikes your muddy water here so he must drink your weak ale and sour wine and after his head hurts i have shae in a manse near the iron gate i want you to go to her and keep her safe whatever may come the huge man smiled his teeth a yellow crevasse in the hairy wilderness of his beard shagga will fetch her here just see that no harm comes to her tell her i will come to her as soon as i may this very night perhaps or on the morrow for a certainty yet by evenfall the city was still in turmoil though brorm reported that the fires were quenched and most of the roving mobs dispersed much as tyrion yearned for the comfort of shaes arms he realized he would go nowhere that night ser jacelyn bywater delivered the butchers bill as he was supping on a cold capon and brown bread in page the gloom of his solar dusk had faded to darkness by then but when his servants came to light his candles and start a fire in the hearth tyrion had roared at them and sent them running his mood was as black as the chamber and bywater said nothing to lighten it the list of the slain was topped by the high septon ripped apart as he squealed to his gods for mercy starving men take a hard view of priests too fat to walk tyrion reflected ser prestons corpse had been overlooked at first the gold cloaks had been searching for a knight in white armor and he had been stabbed and hacked so cruelly that he was redbrown from head to heel ser aron santagar had been found in a gutter his head a red pulp inside a crushed helm lady tandas daughter had surrendered her maidenhood to half a hundred shouting men behind a tanners shop the gold cloaks found her wandering naked on sowbelly row tyrek was still missing as was the high septons crystal crown nine gold cloaks had been slain two score wounded no one had troubled to count how many of the mob had died i want tyrek found alive or dead tyrion said curtly when bywater was done hes no more than a boy son to my late uncle tygett his father was always kind to me well find him the septons crown as well the others can bugger each other with the septons crown for all i care when you named me to command the watch you told me you wanted plain truth always somehow i have a feeling i am not going to like whatever youre about to say tyrion said gloomily we held the city today my lord but i make no promises for the morrow the kettle is close to boiling so many thieves and murderers are abroad that no mans house is safe the bloody flux is spreading in the stews along pisswater bend theres no food to be had for copper nor silver where before you heard only mutterings from the gutter now theres open talk of treason in guildhalls and markets do you need more men i do not trust half the men i have now slynt tripled the size of the watch but it takes more than a gold cloak to make a watchman there are good men and loyal among the new recruits but also more brutes sots cravens and traitors than youd care to know theyre halftrained and undisciplined and what loyalty they have is to their own skins if it comes to battle theyll not hold i fear i never expected them to said tyrion once our walls are breeched we are lost ive known that from the start my men are largely drawn from the smallfolk they walk the same streets drink in the same winesinks spoon down their bowls of brown in the same potshops your eunuch must have told you there is small love for the lannisters in kings landing many still remember how your lord father sacked the city when aerys opened the gates to him they whisper that the gods are punishing us for the sins of your housefor your brothers murder of king aerys for the butchery of rhaegars children for the execution page of eddard stark and the savagery of joffreys justice some talk openly of how much better things were when robert was king and hint that times would be better again with stannis on the throne in potshops and winesinks and brothels you hear these thingsand in the barracks and guardhalls as well i fear they hate my family is that what you are telling me aye and will turn on them if the chance comes me as well ask your eunuch im asking you bywaters deepset eyes met the dwarfs mismatched ones and did not blink you most of all my lord most of all the injustice was like to choke him it was joffrey who told them to eat their dead joffrey who set his dog on them how could they blame me his grace is but a boy in the streets it is said that he has evil councillors the queen has never been known as a friend to the commons nor is lord varys called the spider out of love but it is you they blame most your sister and the eunuch were here when times were better under king robert but you were not they say that youve filled the city with swaggering sellswords and unwashed savages brutes who take what they want and follow no laws but their own they say you exiled janos slynt because you found him too bluff and honest for your liking they say you threw wise and gentle pycelle into the dungeons when he dared raise his voice against you some even claim that you mean to seize the iron throne for your own yes and i am a monster besides hideous and misshapen never forget that his hand coiled into a fist ive heard enough we both have work to attend to leave me perhaps my lord father was right to despise me all these years if this is the best i can achieve tyrion thought when he was alone he stared down at the remains of his supper his belly roiling at the sight of the cold greasy capon disgusted he pushed it away shouted for pod and sent the boy running to summon varys and bronn my most trusted advisers are a eunuch and a sellsword and my ladys a whore what does that say of me bronn complained of the gloom when he arrived and insisted on a fire in the hearth it was blazing by the time varys made his appearance where have you been tyrion demanded about the kings business my sweet lord ah yes the king tyrion muttered my nephew is not fit to sit a privy let alone the iron throne varys shrugged an apprentice must be taught his trade half the prentices on reeking lane could rule better than this king of yours bronn seated himself across the table and pulled a wing off the capon tyrion had made a practice of ignoring the sellswords frequent insolences but tonight he found it galling page i dont recall giving you leave to finish my supper
