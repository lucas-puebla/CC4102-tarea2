harry potter and the sorcerers stonechapter onethe boy who livedmr and mrs dursley of number four privet drive were proud to say that they were perfectly normal thank you very much they were the last people youd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious because they just didnt hold with such nonsensemr dursley was the director of a firm called grunnings which made drills he was a big beefy man with hardly any neck although he did have a very large mustache mrs dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences spying on the neighbors the dursleys had a small son called dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywherethe dursleys had everything they wanted but they also had a secret and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it they didnt think they could bear it if anyone found out about the potters mrs potter was mrs dursleys sister but they hadnt met for several years in fact mrs dursley pretended she didnt have a sister because her sister and her goodfornothing husband were as undursleyish as it was possible to be the dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the potters arrived in the street the dursleys knew that the potters had a small son too but they had never even seen him this boy was another good reason for keeping the potters away they didnt want dudley mixing with a child like thatwhen mr and mrs dursley woke up on the dull gray tuesday our story starts there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country mr dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work and mrs dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming dudley into his high chairnone of them noticed a large tawny owl flutter past the windowat half past eight mr dursley picked up his briefcase pecked mrs dursley on the cheek and tried to kiss dudley goodbye but missed because dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls little tyke chortled mr dursley as he left the house he got into his car and backed out of number fours driveit was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar a cat reading a map for a second mr dursley didnt realize what he had seen then he jerked his head around to look again there was a tabby cat standing on the corner of privet drive but there wasnt a map in sight what could he have been thinking of it must have been a trick of the light mr dursley blinked and stared at the cat it stared back as mr dursley drove around the corner and up the road he watched the cat in his mirror it was now reading the sign that said privet drive no looking at the sign cats couldnt read maps or signs mr dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind as he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that daybut on the edge of town drills were driven out of his mind by something else as he sat in the usual morning traffic jam he couldnt help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about people in cloaks mr dursley couldnt bear people who dressed in funny clothes the getups you saw on young people he supposed this was some stupid new fashion he drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by they were whispering excitedly together mr dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them werent young at all why that man had to be older than he was and wearing an emeraldgreen cloak the nerve of him but then it struck mr dursley that this was probably some silly stunt these people were obviously collecting for somethingyes that would be it the traffic moved on and a few minutes later mr dursley arrived in the grunnings parking lot his mind back on drillsmr dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor if he hadnt he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning he didnt see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight though people down in the street did they pointed and gazed open mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime mr dursley however had a perfectly normal owlfree morning he yelled at five different people he made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more he was in a very good mood until lunchtime when he thought hed stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakeryhed forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the bakers he eyed them angrily as he passed he didnt know why but they made him uneasy this bunch were whispering excitedly too and he couldnt see a single collecting tin it was on his way back past them clutching a large doughnut in a bag that he caught a few words of what they were sayingthe potters thats right thats what i heard yes their son harrymr dursley stopped dead fear flooded him he looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them but thought better of ithe dashed back across the road hurried up to his office snapped at his secretary not to disturb him seized his telephone and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind he put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache thinking no he was being stupid potter wasnt such an unusual name he was sure there were lots of people called potter who had a son called harry come to think of it he wasnt even sure his nephew was called harry hed never even seen the boy it might have been harvey or harold there was no point in worrying mrs dursley she always got so upset at any mention of her sister he didnt blame her if hed had a sister like that but all the same those people in cloakshe found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five oclock he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the doorsorry he grunted as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell it was a few seconds before mr dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak he didnt seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground on the contrary his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare dont be sorry my dear sir for nothing could upset me today rejoice for youknowwho has gone at last even muggles like yourself should be celebrating this happy happy dayand the old man hugged mr dursley around the middle and walked offmr dursley stood rooted to the spot he had been hugged by a complete stranger he also thought he had been called a muggle whatever that was he was rattled he hurried to his car and set off for home hoping he was imagining things which he had never hoped before because he didnt approve of imaginationas he pulled into the driveway of number four the first thing he saw and it didnt improve his mood was the tabby cat hed spotted that morning it was now sitting on his garden wall he was sure it was the same one it had the same markings around its eyesshoo said mr dursley loudly the cat didnt move it just gave him a stern look was this normal cat behavior mr dursley wondered trying to pull himself together he let himself into the house he was still determined not to mention anything to his wifemrs dursley had had a nice normal day she told him over dinner all about mrs next doors problems with her daughter and how dudley had learned a new word wont mr dursley tried to act normally when dudley had been put to bed he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news and finally birdwatchers everywhere have reported that the nations owls have been behaving very unusually today although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern the newscaster allowed himself a grinmost mysterious and now over to jim mcguffin with the weather going to be any more showers of owls tonight jimwell ted said the weatherman i dont know about that but its not only the owls that have been acting oddly today viewers as far apart as kent yorkshire and dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain i promised yesterday theyve had a downpour of shooting stars perhaps people have been celebrating bonfire night early its not until next week folks but i can promise a wet night tonightmr dursley sat frozen in his armchair shooting stars all over britain owls flying by daylight mysterious people in cloaks all over the place and a whisper a whisper about the pottersmrs dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea it was no good hed have to say something to her he cleared his throat nervously er petunia dear you havent heard from your sister lately have youas he had expected mrs dursley looked shocked and angry after all they normally pretended she didnt have a sisterno she said sharply whyfunny stuff on the news mr dursley mumbled owls shooting stars and there were a lot of funnylooking people in town todayso snapped mrs dursleywell i just thought maybe it was something to do with you know her crowdmrs dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips mr dursley wondered whether he dared tell her hed heard the name potter he decided he didnt dare instead he said as casually as he could their son hed be about dudleys age now wouldnt hei suppose so said mrs dursley stifflywhats his name again howard isnt itharry nasty common name if you ask meoh yes said mr dursley his heart sinking horribly yes i quite agreehe didnt say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bedwhile mrs dursley was in the bathroom mr dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden the cat was still thereit was staring down privet drive as though it were waiting for somethingwas he imagining things could all this have anything to do with the potters if it did if it got out that they were related to a pair of well he didnt think he could bear itthe dursleys got into bed mrs dursley fell asleep quickly but mr dursley lay awake turning it all over in his mind his last comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the potters were involved there was no reason for them to come near him and mrs dursley the potters knew very well what he and petunia thought about them and their kind he couldnt see how he and petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on he yawned and turned over it couldnt affect themhow very wrong he wasmr dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness it was sitting as still as a statue its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of privet drive it didnt so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street nor when two owls swooped overhead in fact it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at alla man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching appeared so suddenly and silently youd have thought hed just popped out of the ground the cats tail twitched and its eyes narrowednothing like this man had ever been seen on privet drive he was tall thin and very old judging by the silver of his hair and beard which were both long enough to tuck into his belt he was wearing long robes a purple cloak that swept the ground and highheeled buckled bootshis blue eyes were light bright and sparkling behind halfmoon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked as though it had been broken at least twice this mans name was albus dumbledorealbus dumbledore didnt seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome he was busy rummaging in his cloak looking for something but he did seem to realize he was being watched because he looked up suddenly at the cat which was still staring at him from the other end of the street for some reason the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him he chuckled and muttered i should have knownhe found what he was looking for in his inside pocket it seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter he flicked it open held it up in the air and clicked it the nearest street lamp went out with a little pop he clicked it again the next lamp flickered into darkness twelve times he clicked the putouter until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance which were the eyes of the cat watching him if anyone looked out of their window now even beadyeyed mrs dursley they wouldnt be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement dumbledore slipped the putouter back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four where he sat down on the wall next to the cat he didnt look at it but after a moment he spoke to itfancy seeing you here professor mcgonagallhe turned to smile at the tabby but it had gone instead he was smiling at a rather severelooking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes she too was wearing a cloak an emerald one her black hair was drawn into a tight bun she looked distinctly ruffledhow did you know it was me she askedmy dear professor i ve never seen a cat sit so stifflyyoud be stiff if youd been sitting on a brick wall all day said professor mcgonagallall day when you could have been celebrating i must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way hereprofessor mcgonagall sniffed angrilyoh yes everyones celebrating all right she said impatientlyyoud think theyd be a bit more careful but no even the muggles have noticed somethings going on it was on their news she jerked her head back at the dursleys dark livingroom window i heard it flocks of owls shooting stars well theyre not completely stupid they were bound to notice something shooting stars down in kent ill bet that was dedalus diggle he never had much senseyou cant blame them said dumbledore gently weve had precious little to celebrate for eleven yearsi know that said professor mcgonagall irritably but thats no reason to lose our heads people are being downright careless out on the streets in broad daylight not even dressed in muggle clothes swapping rumorsshe threw a sharp sideways glance at dumbledore here as though hoping he was going to tell her something but he didnt so she went on a fine thing it would be if on the very day youknowwho seems to have disappeared at last the muggles found out about us all i suppose he really has gone dumbledoreit certainly seems so said dumbledore we have much to be thankful for would you care for a lemon dropa whata lemon drop theyre a kind of muggle sweet im rather fond ofno thank you said professor mcgonagall coldly as though she didnt think this was the moment for lemon drops as i say even if youknowwho has gone my dear professor surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name all this you knowwho nonsense for eleven years i have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name voldemort professor mcgonagall flinched but dumbledore who was unsticking two lemon drops seemed not to notice it all gets so confusing if we keep saying youknowwho i have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying voldemorts namei know you haven t said professor mcgonagall sounding half exasperated half admiring but youre different everyone knows youre the only one youknow oh all right voldemort was frightened ofyou flatter me said dumbledore calmly voldemort had powers i will never haveonly because youre too well noble to use themits lucky its dark i havent blushed so much since madam pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffsprofessor mcgonagall shot a sharp look at dumbledore and said the owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around you know what everyones saying about why hes disappeared about what finally stopped himit seemed that professor mcgonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss the real reason she had been waiting on a cold hard wall all day for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now it was plain that whatever everyone was saying she was not going to believe it until dumbledore told her it was true dumbledore however was choosing another lemon drop and did not answerwhat theyre saying she pressed on is that last night voldemort turned up in godrics hollow he went to find the potters the rumor is that lily and james potter are are that theyre dead Ã¢â‚¬Å“dumbledore bowed his head professor mcgonagall gaspedlily and james i cant believe it i didnt want to believe itoh albusdumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder i know i know he said heavilyprofessor mcgonagalls voice trembled as she went on thats not alltheyre saying he tried to kill the potters son harry but he couldnt he couldnt kill that little boy no one knows why or how but theyre saying that when he couldnt kill harry potter voldemorts power somehow broke and thats why hes gonedumbledore nodded glumlyits its true faltered professor mcgonagall after all hes done all the people hes killed he couldnt kill a little boy its just astounding of all the things to stop him but how in the name of heaven did harry survivewe can only guess said dumbledore we may never knowprofessor mcgonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it it was a very odd watchit had twelve hands but no numbers instead little planets were moving around the edge it must have made sense to dumbledore though because he put it back in his pocket and said hagrids late i suppose it was he who told you id be here by the wayyes said professor mcgonagall and i dont suppose youre going to tell me why youre here of all placesive come to bring harry to his aunt and uncle theyre the only family he has left nowyou dont mean you cant mean the people who live here cried professor mcgonagall jumping to her feet and pointing at number fourdumbledore you cant ive been watching them all day you couldnt find two people who are less like us and theyve got this son i saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street screaming for sweetsharry potter come and live hereits the best place for him said dumbledore firmly his aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when hes older ive written them a lettera letter repeated professor mcgonagall faintly sitting back down on the wall really dumbledore you think you can explain all this in a letter these people will never understand him hell be famous a legend i wouldnt be surprised if today was known as harry potter day in the future there will be books written about harry every child in our world will know his nameexactly said dumbledore looking very seriously over the top of his halfmoon glasses it would be enough to turn any boys head famous before he can walk and talk famous for something he wont even remember cara you see how much better off hell be growing up away from all that until hes ready to take itprofessor mcgonagall opened her mouth changed her mind swallowed and then said yes yes youre right of course but how is the boy getting here dumbledore she eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding harry underneath ithagrids bringing himyou think it wise to trust hagrid with something as important as thisi would trust hagrid with my life said dumbledoreim not saying his heart isnt in the right place said professor mcgonagall grudgingly but you cant pretend hes not careless he does tend to what was thata low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them it grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of themif the motorcycle was huge it was nothing to the man sitting astride it he was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide he looked simply too big to be allowed and so wild long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face he had hands the size of trash can lids and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins in his vast muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blanketshagrid said dumbledore sounding relieved at last and where did you get that motorcycleborrowed it professor dumbledore sit said the giant climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke young sirius black lent it to me ive got him sirno problems were thereno sir house was almost destroyed but i got him out all right before the muggles started swarmin around he fell asleep as we was flyin over bristoldumbledore and professor mcgonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets inside just visible was a baby boy fast asleep under a tuft of jetblack hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut like a bolt of lightningis that where whispered professor mcgonagallyes said dumbledore hell have that scar forevercouldnt you do something about it dumbledoreeven if i could i wouldnt scars can come in handy i have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the london underground well give him here hagrid wed better get this over withdumbledore took harry in his arms and turned toward the dursleys housecould i could i say goodbye to him sir asked hagrid he bent his great shaggy head over harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy whiskery kiss then suddenly hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dogshhh hissed professor mcgonagall youll wake the mugglessssorry sobbed hagrid taking out a large spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it but i cccant stand it lily an james dead an poor little harry off ter live with muggles yes yes its all very sad but get a grip on yourself hagrid or well be found professor mcgonagall whispered patting hagrid gingerly on the arm as dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door he laid harry gently on the doorstep took a letter out of his cloak tucked it inside harrys blankets and then came back to the other two for a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle hagrids shoulders shook professor mcgonagall blinked furiously and the twinkling light that usually shone from dumbledores eyes seemed to have gone outwell said dumbledore finally thats that weve no business staying here we may as well go and join the celebrationsyeah said hagrid in a very muffled voice ill be takin sirius his bike back gnight professor mcgonagall professor dumbledore sirwiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life with a roar it rose into the air and off into the nighti shall see you soon i expect professor mcgonagall said dumbledore nodding to her professor mcgonagall blew her nose in replydumbledore turned and walked back down the street on the corner he stopped and took out the silver putouter he clicked it once and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that privet drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street he could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number fourgood luck harry he murmured he turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak he was gonea breeze ruffled the neat hedges of privet drive which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen harry potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up one small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on not knowing he was special not knowing he was famous not knowing he would be woken in a few hours time by mrs dursleys scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin dudley he couldnt know that at this very moment people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices to harry potter the boy who livedchapter twothe vanishing glassnearly ten years had passed since the dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step but privet drive had hardly changed at all the sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the dursleys front door it crept into their living room which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when mr dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passedten years ago there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing differentcolored bonnets but dudley dursley was no longer a baby and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle on a carousel at the fair playing a computer game with his father being hugged and kissed by his motherthe room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house tooyet harry potter was still there asleep at the moment but not for long his aunt petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the dayup get up nowharry woke with a start his aunt rapped on the door againup she screeched harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove he rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having it had been a good one there had been a flying motorcycle in it he had a funny feeling hed had the same dream beforehis aunt was back outside the doorare you up yet she demandednearly said harrywell get a move on i want you to look after the bacon and dont you dare let it burn i want everything perfect on duddys birthdayharry groanedwhat did you say his aunt snapped through the doornothing nothingdudleys birthday how could he have forgotten harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks he found a pair under his bed and after pulling a spider off one of them put them on harry was used to spiders because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them and that was where he sleptwhen he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen the table was almost hidden beneath all dudleys birthday presents it looked as though dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted not to mention the second television and the racing bike exactly why dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to harry as dudley was very fat and hated exercise unless of course it involved punching somebody dudleys favorite punching bag was harry but he couldnt often catch him harry didnt look it but he was very fastperhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard but harry had always been small and skinny for his age he looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of dudleys and dudley was about four times bigger than he was harry had a thin face knobbly knees black hair and bright green eyes he wore round glasses held together with a lot of scotch tape because of all the times dudley had punched him on the nose the only thing harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning he had had it as long as he could remember and the first question he could ever remember asking his aunt petunia was how he had gotten itin the car crash when your parents died she had said and dont ask questionsdont ask questions that was the first rule for a quiet life with the dursleysuncle vernon entered the kitchen as harry was turning over the baconcomb your hair he barked by way of a morning greetingabout once a week uncle vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that harry needed a haircut harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together but it made no difference his hair simply grew that way all over the placeharry was frying eggs by the time dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother dudley looked a lot like uncle vernon he had a large pink face not much neck small watery blue eyes and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick fat head aunt petunia often said that dudley looked like a baby angel harry often said that dudley looked like a pig in a wigharry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table which was difficult as there wasnt much room dudley meanwhile was counting his presentshis face fellthirtysix he said looking up at his mother and father thats two less than last yeardarling you havent counted auntie marges present see its here under this big one from mommy and daddyall right thirtyseven then said dudley going red in the faceharry who could see a huge dudley tantrum coming on began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case dudley turned the table overaunt petunia obviously scented danger too because she said quickly and well buy you another two presents while were out today hows that popkin two more presents is that all right dudley thought for a moment it looked like hard work finally he said slowly so ill have thirty thirtythirtynine sweetums said aunt petuniaoh dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel all right thenuncle vernon chuckled little tyke wants his moneys worth just like his father atta boy dudley he ruffled dudleys hairat that moment the telephone rang and aunt petunia went to answer it while harry and uncle vernon watched dudley unwrap the racing bike a video camera a remote control airplane sixteen new computer games and a vcr he was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when aunt petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worriedbad news vernon she said mrs figgs broken her leg she cant take him she jerked her head in harrys directiondudleys mouth fell open in horror but harrys heart gave a leap every year on dudleys birthday his parents took him and a friend out for the day to adventure parks hamburger restaurants or the movies every year harry was left behind with mrs figg a mad old lady who lived two streets away harry hated it there the whole house smelled of cabbage and mrs figg made him look at photographs of all the cats shed ever ownednow what said aunt petunia looking furiously at harry as though hed planned this harry knew he ought to feel sorry that mrs figg had broken her leg but it wasnt easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at tibbles snowy mr paws and tufty againwe could phone marge uncle vernon suggesteddont be silly vernon she hates the boythe dursleys often spoke about harry like this as though he wasnt there or rather as though he was something very nasty that couldnt understand them like a slugwhat about whatshername your friend yvonneon vacation in majorca snapped aunt petuniayou could just leave me here harry put in hopefully hed be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on dudleys computeraunt petunia looked as though shed just swallowed a lemonand come back and find the house in ruins she snarledi wont blow up the house said harry but they werent listeningi suppose we could take him to the zoo said aunt petunia slowly and leave him in the carthat cars new hes not sitting in it alonedudley began to cry loudly in fact he wasnt really crying it had been years since hed really cried but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed his mother would give him anything he wanteddinky duddydums dont cry mummy wont let him spoil your special day she cried flinging her arms around himi dont want him ttto come dudley yelled between huge pretend sobs he always sp spoils everything he shot harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mothers armsjust then the doorbell rang oh good lord theyre here said aunt petunia frantically and a moment later dudleys best friend piers polkiss walked in with his mother piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat he was usually the one who held peoples arms behind their backs while dudley hit them dudley stopped pretending to cry at oncehalf an hour later harry who couldnt believe his luck was sitting in the back of the dursleys car with piers and dudley on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life his aunt and uncle hadnt been able to think of anything else to do with him but before theyd left uncle vernon had taken harry asideim warning you he had said putting his large purple face right up close to harrys im warning you now boy any funny business anything at all and youll be in that cupboard from now until christmasim not going to do anything said harry honestlybut uncle vernon didnt believe him no one ever didthe problem was strange things often happened around harry and it was just no good telling the dursleys he didnt make them happenonce aunt petunia tired of harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadnt been at all had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs which she left to hide that horrible scar dudley had laughed himself silly at harry who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glassesnext morning however he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before aunt petunia had sheared it off he had been given a week in his cupboard for this even though he had tried to explain that he couldnt explain how it had grown back so quicklyanother time aunt petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of dudleys brown with orange puff balls the harder she tried to pull it over his head the smaller it seemed to become until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet but certainly wouldnt fit harry aunt petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and to his great relief harry wasnt punishedon the other hand hed gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens dudleys gang had been chasing him as usual when as much to harrys surprise as anyone elses there he was sitting on the chimney the dursleys had received a very angry letter from harrys headmistress telling them harry had been climbing school buildings but all hed tried to do as he shouted at uncle vernon through the locked door of his cupboard was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid jumpbut today nothing was going to go wrong it was even worth being with dudley and piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasnt school his cupboard or mrs figgs cabbagesmelling living roomwhile he drove uncle vernon complained to aunt petunia he liked to complain about things people at work harry the council harry the bank and harry were just a few of his favorite subjects this morning it was motorcyclesroaring along like maniacs the young hoodlums he said as a motorcycle overtook themi had a dream about a motorcycle said harry remembering suddenly it was flyinguncle vernon nearly crashed into the car in front he turned right around in his seat and yelled at harry his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache motorcycles dont flydudley and piers sniggeredi know they dont said harry it was only a dreambut he wished he hadnt said anything if there was one thing the dursleys hated even more than his asking questions it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldnt no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideasit was a very sunny saturday and the zoo was crowded with families the dursleys bought dudley and piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then because the smiling lady in the van had asked harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop it wasnt bad either harry thought licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like dudley except that it wasnt blondharry had the best morning hed had in a long time he was careful to walk a little way apart from the dursleys so that dudley and piers who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime wouldnt fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him they ate in the zoo restaurant and when dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didnt have enough ice cream on top uncle vernon bought him another one and harry was allowed to finish the firstharry felt afterward that he should have known it was all too good to lastafter lunch they went to the reptile house it was cool and dark in there with lit windows all along the walls behind the glass all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone dudley and piers wanted to see huge poisonous cobras and thick mancrushing pythons dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place it could have wrapped its body twice around uncle vernons car and crushed it into a trash can but at the moment it didnt look in the mood in fact it was fast asleepdudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass staring at the glistening brown coilsmake it move he whined at his father uncle vernon tapped on the glass but the snake didnt budgedo it again dudley ordered uncle vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles but the snake just snoozed onthis is boring dudley moaned he shuffled awayharry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake he wouldnt have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long it was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom where the only visitor was aunt petunia hammering on the door to wake you up at least he got to visit the rest of the housethe snake suddenly opened its beady eyes slowly very slowly it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with harrysit winkedharry stared then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching they werent he looked back at the snake and winked toothe snake jerked its head toward uncle vernon and dudley then raised its eyes to the ceiling it gave harry a look that said quite plainly i get that all the timei know harry murmured through the glass though he wasnt sure the snake could hear him it must be really annoyingthe snake nodded vigorouslywhere do you come from anyway harry askedthe snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass harry peered at itboa constrictor brazilwas it nice therethe boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and harry read on this specimen was bred in the zoo oh i see so youve never been to brazilas the snake shook its head a deafening shout behind harry made both of them jumpdudley mr dursley come and look at this snake you wont believe what its doingdudley came waddling toward them as fast as he couldout of the way you he said punching harry in the ribs caught by surprise harry fell hard on the concrete floor what came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened one second piers and dudley were leaning right up close to the glass the next they had leapt back with howls of horrorharry sat up and gasped the glass front of the boa constrictors tank had vanished the great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly slithering out onto the floor people throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exitsas the snake slid swiftly past him harry could have sworn a low hissing voice said brazil here i come thanksss amigothe keeper of the reptile house was in shockbut the glass he kept saying where did the glass gothe zoo director himself made aunt petunia a cup of strong sweet tea while he apologized over and over again piers and dudley could only gibber as far as harry had seen the snake hadnt done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed but by the time they were all back in uncle vernons car dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg while piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death but worst of all for harry at least was piers calming down enough to say harry was talking to it werent you harryuncle vernon waited until piers was safely out of the house before starting on harry he was so angry he could hardly speak he managed to say go cupboard stay no meals before he collapsed into a chair and aunt petunia had to run and get him a large brandyharry lay in his dark cupboard much later wishing he had a watch he didnt know what time it was and he couldnt be sure the dursleys were asleep yet until they were he couldnt risk sneaking to the kitchen for some foodhed lived with the dursleys almost ten years ten miserable years as long as he could remember ever since hed been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash he couldnt remember being in the car when his parents had died sometimes when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard he came up with a strange vision a blinding flash of green light and a burn ing pain on his forehead this he supposed was the crash though he couldnt imagine where all the green light came from he couldnt remember his parents at all his aunt and uncle never spoke about them and of course he was forbidden to ask questions there were no photographs of them in the housewhen he had been younger harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away but it had never happened the dursleys were his only family yet sometimes he thought or maybe hoped that strangers in the street seemed to know him very strange strangers they were too a tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with aunt petunia and dudley after asking harry furiously if he knew the man aunt petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything a wildlooking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus a bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word the weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second harry tried to get a closer lookat school harry had no one everybody knew that dudleys gang hated that odd harry potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses and nobody liked to disagree with dudleys gangchapter threethe letters from no onethe escape of the brazilian boa constrictor earned harry his longestever punishment by the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again the summer holidays had started and dudley had already broken his new video camera crashed his remote control airplane and first time out on his racing bike knocked down old mrs figg as she crossed privet drive on her crutchesharry was glad school was over but there was no escaping dudleys gang who visited the house every single day piers dennis malcolm and gordon were all big and stupid but as dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot he was the leader the rest of them were all quite happy to join in dudleys favorite sport harry huntingthis was why harry spent as much time as possible out of the house wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays where he could see a tiny ray of hope when september came he would be going off to secondary school and for the first time in his life he wouldnt be with dudley dudley had been accepted at uncle vernons old private school smeltings piers polkiss was going there too harry on the other hand was going to stonewall high the local public school dudley thought this was very funny
