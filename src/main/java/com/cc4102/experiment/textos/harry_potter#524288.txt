harry potter and the sorcerers stonechapter onethe boy who livedmr and mrs dursley of number four privet drive were proud to say that they were perfectly normal thank you very much they were the last people youd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious because they just didnt hold with such nonsensemr dursley was the director of a firm called grunnings which made drills he was a big beefy man with hardly any neck although he did have a very large mustache mrs dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences spying on the neighbors the dursleys had a small son called dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywherethe dursleys had everything they wanted but they also had a secret and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it they didnt think they could bear it if anyone found out about the potters mrs potter was mrs dursleys sister but they hadnt met for several years in fact mrs dursley pretended she didnt have a sister because her sister and her goodfornothing husband were as undursleyish as it was possible to be the dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the potters arrived in the street the dursleys knew that the potters had a small son too but they had never even seen him this boy was another good reason for keeping the potters away they didnt want dudley mixing with a child like thatwhen mr and mrs dursley woke up on the dull gray tuesday our story starts there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country mr dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work and mrs dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming dudley into his high chairnone of them noticed a large tawny owl flutter past the windowat half past eight mr dursley picked up his briefcase pecked mrs dursley on the cheek and tried to kiss dudley goodbye but missed because dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls little tyke chortled mr dursley as he left the house he got into his car and backed out of number fours driveit was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar a cat reading a map for a second mr dursley didnt realize what he had seen then he jerked his head around to look again there was a tabby cat standing on the corner of privet drive but there wasnt a map in sight what could he have been thinking of it must have been a trick of the light mr dursley blinked and stared at the cat it stared back as mr dursley drove around the corner and up the road he watched the cat in his mirror it was now reading the sign that said privet drive no looking at the sign cats couldnt read maps or signs mr dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind as he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that daybut on the edge of town drills were driven out of his mind by something else as he sat in the usual morning traffic jam he couldnt help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about people in cloaks mr dursley couldnt bear people who dressed in funny clothes the getups you saw on young people he supposed this was some stupid new fashion he drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by they were whispering excitedly together mr dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them werent young at all why that man had to be older than he was and wearing an emeraldgreen cloak the nerve of him but then it struck mr dursley that this was probably some silly stunt these people were obviously collecting for somethingyes that would be it the traffic moved on and a few minutes later mr dursley arrived in the grunnings parking lot his mind back on drillsmr dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor if he hadnt he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning he didnt see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight though people down in the street did they pointed and gazed open mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime mr dursley however had a perfectly normal owlfree morning he yelled at five different people he made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more he was in a very good mood until lunchtime when he thought hed stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakeryhed forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the bakers he eyed them angrily as he passed he didnt know why but they made him uneasy this bunch were whispering excitedly too and he couldnt see a single collecting tin it was on his way back past them clutching a large doughnut in a bag that he caught a few words of what they were sayingthe potters thats right thats what i heard yes their son harrymr dursley stopped dead fear flooded him he looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them but thought better of ithe dashed back across the road hurried up to his office snapped at his secretary not to disturb him seized his telephone and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind he put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache thinking no he was being stupid potter wasnt such an unusual name he was sure there were lots of people called potter who had a son called harry come to think of it he wasnt even sure his nephew was called harry hed never even seen the boy it might have been harvey or harold there was no point in worrying mrs dursley she always got so upset at any mention of her sister he didnt blame her if hed had a sister like that but all the same those people in cloakshe found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five oclock he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the doorsorry he grunted as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell it was a few seconds before mr dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak he didnt seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground on the contrary his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare dont be sorry my dear sir for nothing could upset me today rejoice for youknowwho has gone at last even muggles like yourself should be celebrating this happy happy dayand the old man hugged mr dursley around the middle and walked offmr dursley stood rooted to the spot he had been hugged by a complete stranger he also thought he had been called a muggle whatever that was he was rattled he hurried to his car and set off for home hoping he was imagining things which he had never hoped before because he didnt approve of imaginationas he pulled into the driveway of number four the first thing he saw and it didnt improve his mood was the tabby cat hed spotted that morning it was now sitting on his garden wall he was sure it was the same one it had the same markings around its eyesshoo said mr dursley loudly the cat didnt move it just gave him a stern look was this normal cat behavior mr dursley wondered trying to pull himself together he let himself into the house he was still determined not to mention anything to his wifemrs dursley had had a nice normal day she told him over dinner all about mrs next doors problems with her daughter and how dudley had learned a new word wont mr dursley tried to act normally when dudley had been put to bed he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news and finally birdwatchers everywhere have reported that the nations owls have been behaving very unusually today although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern the newscaster allowed himself a grinmost mysterious and now over to jim mcguffin with the weather going to be any more showers of owls tonight jimwell ted said the weatherman i dont know about that but its not only the owls that have been acting oddly today viewers as far apart as kent yorkshire and dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain i promised yesterday theyve had a downpour of shooting stars perhaps people have been celebrating bonfire night early its not until next week folks but i can promise a wet night tonightmr dursley sat frozen in his armchair shooting stars all over britain owls flying by daylight mysterious people in cloaks all over the place and a whisper a whisper about the pottersmrs dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea it was no good hed have to say something to her he cleared his throat nervously er petunia dear you havent heard from your sister lately have youas he had expected mrs dursley looked shocked and angry after all they normally pretended she didnt have a sisterno she said sharply whyfunny stuff on the news mr dursley mumbled owls shooting stars and there were a lot of funnylooking people in town todayso snapped mrs dursleywell i just thought maybe it was something to do with you know her crowdmrs dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips mr dursley wondered whether he dared tell her hed heard the name potter he decided he didnt dare instead he said as casually as he could their son hed be about dudleys age now wouldnt hei suppose so said mrs dursley stifflywhats his name again howard isnt itharry nasty common name if you ask meoh yes said mr dursley his heart sinking horribly yes i quite agreehe didnt say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bedwhile mrs dursley was in the bathroom mr dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden the cat was still thereit was staring down privet drive as though it were waiting for somethingwas he imagining things could all this have anything to do with the potters if it did if it got out that they were related to a pair of well he didnt think he could bear itthe dursleys got into bed mrs dursley fell asleep quickly but mr dursley lay awake turning it all over in his mind his last comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the potters were involved there was no reason for them to come near him and mrs dursley the potters knew very well what he and petunia thought about them and their kind he couldnt see how he and petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on he yawned and turned over it couldnt affect themhow very wrong he wasmr dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness it was sitting as still as a statue its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of privet drive it didnt so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street nor when two owls swooped overhead in fact it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at alla man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching appeared so suddenly and silently youd have thought hed just popped out of the ground the cats tail twitched and its eyes narrowednothing like this man had ever been seen on privet drive he was tall thin and very old judging by the silver of his hair and beard which were both long enough to tuck into his belt he was wearing long robes a purple cloak that swept the ground and highheeled buckled bootshis blue eyes were light bright and sparkling behind halfmoon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked as though it had been broken at least twice this mans name was albus dumbledorealbus dumbledore didnt seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome he was busy rummaging in his cloak looking for something but he did seem to realize he was being watched because he looked up suddenly at the cat which was still staring at him from the other end of the street for some reason the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him he chuckled and muttered i should have knownhe found what he was looking for in his inside pocket it seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter he flicked it open held it up in the air and clicked it the nearest street lamp went out with a little pop he clicked it again the next lamp flickered into darkness twelve times he clicked the putouter until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance which were the eyes of the cat watching him if anyone looked out of their window now even beadyeyed mrs dursley they wouldnt be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement dumbledore slipped the putouter back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four where he sat down on the wall next to the cat he didnt look at it but after a moment he spoke to itfancy seeing you here professor mcgonagallhe turned to smile at the tabby but it had gone instead he was smiling at a rather severelooking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes she too was wearing a cloak an emerald one her black hair was drawn into a tight bun she looked distinctly ruffledhow did you know it was me she askedmy dear professor i ve never seen a cat sit so stifflyyoud be stiff if youd been sitting on a brick wall all day said professor mcgonagallall day when you could have been celebrating i must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way hereprofessor mcgonagall sniffed angrilyoh yes everyones celebrating all right she said impatientlyyoud think theyd be a bit more careful but no even the muggles have noticed somethings going on it was on their news she jerked her head back at the dursleys dark livingroom window i heard it flocks of owls shooting stars well theyre not completely stupid they were bound to notice something shooting stars down in kent ill bet that was dedalus diggle he never had much senseyou cant blame them said dumbledore gently weve had precious little to celebrate for eleven yearsi know that said professor mcgonagall irritably but thats no reason to lose our heads people are being downright careless out on the streets in broad daylight not even dressed in muggle clothes swapping rumorsshe threw a sharp sideways glance at dumbledore here as though hoping he was going to tell her something but he didnt so she went on a fine thing it would be if on the very day youknowwho seems to have disappeared at last the muggles found out about us all i suppose he really has gone dumbledoreit certainly seems so said dumbledore we have much to be thankful for would you care for a lemon dropa whata lemon drop theyre a kind of muggle sweet im rather fond ofno thank you said professor mcgonagall coldly as though she didnt think this was the moment for lemon drops as i say even if youknowwho has gone my dear professor surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name all this you knowwho nonsense for eleven years i have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name voldemort professor mcgonagall flinched but dumbledore who was unsticking two lemon drops seemed not to notice it all gets so confusing if we keep saying youknowwho i have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying voldemorts namei know you haven t said professor mcgonagall sounding half exasperated half admiring but youre different everyone knows youre the only one youknow oh all right voldemort was frightened ofyou flatter me said dumbledore calmly voldemort had powers i will never haveonly because youre too well noble to use themits lucky its dark i havent blushed so much since madam pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffsprofessor mcgonagall shot a sharp look at dumbledore and said the owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around you know what everyones saying about why hes disappeared about what finally stopped himit seemed that professor mcgonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss the real reason she had been waiting on a cold hard wall all day for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now it was plain that whatever everyone was saying she was not going to believe it until dumbledore told her it was true dumbledore however was choosing another lemon drop and did not answerwhat theyre saying she pressed on is that last night voldemort turned up in godrics hollow he went to find the potters the rumor is that lily and james potter are are that theyre dead Ã¢â‚¬Å“dumbledore bowed his head professor mcgonagall gaspedlily and james i cant believe it i didnt want to believe itoh albusdumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder i know i know he said heavilyprofessor mcgonagalls voice trembled as she went on thats not alltheyre saying he tried to kill the potters son harry but he couldnt he couldnt kill that little boy no one knows why or how but theyre saying that when he couldnt kill harry potter voldemorts power somehow broke and thats why hes gonedumbledore nodded glumlyits its true faltered professor mcgonagall after all hes done all the people hes killed he couldnt kill a little boy its just astounding of all the things to stop him but how in the name of heaven did harry survivewe can only guess said dumbledore we may never knowprofessor mcgonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it it was a very odd watchit had twelve hands but no numbers instead little planets were moving around the edge it must have made sense to dumbledore though because he put it back in his pocket and said hagrids late i suppose it was he who told you id be here by the wayyes said professor mcgonagall and i dont suppose youre going to tell me why youre here of all placesive come to bring harry to his aunt and uncle theyre the only family he has left nowyou dont mean you cant mean the people who live here cried professor mcgonagall jumping to her feet and pointing at number fourdumbledore you cant ive been watching them all day you couldnt find two people who are less like us and theyve got this son i saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street screaming for sweetsharry potter come and live hereits the best place for him said dumbledore firmly his aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when hes older ive written them a lettera letter repeated professor mcgonagall faintly sitting back down on the wall really dumbledore you think you can explain all this in a letter these people will never understand him hell be famous a legend i wouldnt be surprised if today was known as harry potter day in the future there will be books written about harry every child in our world will know his nameexactly said dumbledore looking very seriously over the top of his halfmoon glasses it would be enough to turn any boys head famous before he can walk and talk famous for something he wont even remember cara you see how much better off hell be growing up away from all that until hes ready to take itprofessor mcgonagall opened her mouth changed her mind swallowed and then said yes yes youre right of course but how is the boy getting here dumbledore she eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding harry underneath ithagrids bringing himyou think it wise to trust hagrid with something as important as thisi would trust hagrid with my life said dumbledoreim not saying his heart isnt in the right place said professor mcgonagall grudgingly but you cant pretend hes not careless he does tend to what was thata low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them it grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of themif the motorcycle was huge it was nothing to the man sitting astride it he was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide he looked simply too big to be allowed and so wild long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face he had hands the size of trash can lids and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins in his vast muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blanketshagrid said dumbledore sounding relieved at last and where did you get that motorcycleborrowed it professor dumbledore sit said the giant climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke young sirius black lent it to me ive got him sirno problems were thereno sir house was almost destroyed but i got him out all right before the muggles started swarmin around he fell asleep as we was flyin over bristoldumbledore and professor mcgonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets inside just visible was a baby boy fast asleep under a tuft of jetblack hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut like a bolt of lightningis that where whispered professor mcgonagallyes said dumbledore hell have that scar forevercouldnt you do something about it dumbledoreeven if i could i wouldnt scars can come in handy i have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the london underground well give him here hagrid wed better get this over withdumbledore took harry in his arms and turned toward the dursleys housecould i could i say goodbye to him sir asked hagrid he bent his great shaggy head over harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy whiskery kiss then suddenly hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dogshhh hissed professor mcgonagall youll wake the mugglessssorry sobbed hagrid taking out a large spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it but i cccant stand it lily an james dead an poor little harry off ter live with muggles yes yes its all very sad but get a grip on yourself hagrid or well be found professor mcgonagall whispered patting hagrid gingerly on the arm as dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door he laid harry gently on the doorstep took a letter out of his cloak tucked it inside harrys blankets and then came back to the other two for a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle hagrids shoulders shook professor mcgonagall blinked furiously and the twinkling light that usually shone from dumbledores eyes seemed to have gone outwell said dumbledore finally thats that weve no business staying here we may as well go and join the celebrationsyeah said hagrid in a very muffled voice ill be takin sirius his bike back gnight professor mcgonagall professor dumbledore sirwiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life with a roar it rose into the air and off into the nighti shall see you soon i expect professor mcgonagall said dumbledore nodding to her professor mcgonagall blew her nose in replydumbledore turned and walked back down the street on the corner he stopped and took out the silver putouter he clicked it once and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that privet drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street he could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number fourgood luck harry he murmured he turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak he was gonea breeze ruffled the neat hedges of privet drive which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen harry potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up one small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on not knowing he was special not knowing he was famous not knowing he would be woken in a few hours time by mrs dursleys scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin dudley he couldnt know that at this very moment people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices to harry potter the boy who livedchapter twothe vanishing glassnearly ten years had passed since the dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step but privet drive had hardly changed at all the sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the dursleys front door it crept into their living room which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when mr dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passedten years ago there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing differentcolored bonnets but dudley dursley was no longer a baby and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle on a carousel at the fair playing a computer game with his father being hugged and kissed by his motherthe room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house tooyet harry potter was still there asleep at the moment but not for long his aunt petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the dayup get up nowharry woke with a start his aunt rapped on the door againup she screeched harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove he rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having it had been a good one there had been a flying motorcycle in it he had a funny feeling hed had the same dream beforehis aunt was back outside the doorare you up yet she demandednearly said harrywell get a move on i want you to look after the bacon and dont you dare let it burn i want everything perfect on duddys birthdayharry groanedwhat did you say his aunt snapped through the doornothing nothingdudleys birthday how could he have forgotten harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks he found a pair under his bed and after pulling a spider off one of them put them on harry was used to spiders because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them and that was where he sleptwhen he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen the table was almost hidden beneath all dudleys birthday presents it looked as though dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted not to mention the second television and the racing bike exactly why dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to harry as dudley was very fat and hated exercise unless of course it involved punching somebody dudleys favorite punching bag was harry but he couldnt often catch him harry didnt look it but he was very fastperhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard but harry had always been small and skinny for his age he looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of dudleys and dudley was about four times bigger than he was harry had a thin face knobbly knees black hair and bright green eyes he wore round glasses held together with a lot of scotch tape because of all the times dudley had punched him on the nose the only thing harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning he had had it as long as he could remember and the first question he could ever remember asking his aunt petunia was how he had gotten itin the car crash when your parents died she had said and dont ask questionsdont ask questions that was the first rule for a quiet life with the dursleysuncle vernon entered the kitchen as harry was turning over the baconcomb your hair he barked by way of a morning greetingabout once a week uncle vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that harry needed a haircut harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together but it made no difference his hair simply grew that way all over the placeharry was frying eggs by the time dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother dudley looked a lot like uncle vernon he had a large pink face not much neck small watery blue eyes and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick fat head aunt petunia often said that dudley looked like a baby angel harry often said that dudley looked like a pig in a wigharry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table which was difficult as there wasnt much room dudley meanwhile was counting his presentshis face fellthirtysix he said looking up at his mother and father thats two less than last yeardarling you havent counted auntie marges present see its here under this big one from mommy and daddyall right thirtyseven then said dudley going red in the faceharry who could see a huge dudley tantrum coming on began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case dudley turned the table overaunt petunia obviously scented danger too because she said quickly and well buy you another two presents while were out today hows that popkin two more presents is that all right dudley thought for a moment it looked like hard work finally he said slowly so ill have thirty thirtythirtynine sweetums said aunt petuniaoh dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel all right thenuncle vernon chuckled little tyke wants his moneys worth just like his father atta boy dudley he ruffled dudleys hairat that moment the telephone rang and aunt petunia went to answer it while harry and uncle vernon watched dudley unwrap the racing bike a video camera a remote control airplane sixteen new computer games and a vcr he was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when aunt petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worriedbad news vernon she said mrs figgs broken her leg she cant take him she jerked her head in harrys directiondudleys mouth fell open in horror but harrys heart gave a leap every year on dudleys birthday his parents took him and a friend out for the day to adventure parks hamburger restaurants or the movies every year harry was left behind with mrs figg a mad old lady who lived two streets away harry hated it there the whole house smelled of cabbage and mrs figg made him look at photographs of all the cats shed ever ownednow what said aunt petunia looking furiously at harry as though hed planned this harry knew he ought to feel sorry that mrs figg had broken her leg but it wasnt easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at tibbles snowy mr paws and tufty againwe could phone marge uncle vernon suggesteddont be silly vernon she hates the boythe dursleys often spoke about harry like this as though he wasnt there or rather as though he was something very nasty that couldnt understand them like a slugwhat about whatshername your friend yvonneon vacation in majorca snapped aunt petuniayou could just leave me here harry put in hopefully hed be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on dudleys computeraunt petunia looked as though shed just swallowed a lemonand come back and find the house in ruins she snarledi wont blow up the house said harry but they werent listeningi suppose we could take him to the zoo said aunt petunia slowly and leave him in the carthat cars new hes not sitting in it alonedudley began to cry loudly in fact he wasnt really crying it had been years since hed really cried but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed his mother would give him anything he wanteddinky duddydums dont cry mummy wont let him spoil your special day she cried flinging her arms around himi dont want him ttto come dudley yelled between huge pretend sobs he always sp spoils everything he shot harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mothers armsjust then the doorbell rang oh good lord theyre here said aunt petunia frantically and a moment later dudleys best friend piers polkiss walked in with his mother piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat he was usually the one who held peoples arms behind their backs while dudley hit them dudley stopped pretending to cry at oncehalf an hour later harry who couldnt believe his luck was sitting in the back of the dursleys car with piers and dudley on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life his aunt and uncle hadnt been able to think of anything else to do with him but before theyd left uncle vernon had taken harry asideim warning you he had said putting his large purple face right up close to harrys im warning you now boy any funny business anything at all and youll be in that cupboard from now until christmasim not going to do anything said harry honestlybut uncle vernon didnt believe him no one ever didthe problem was strange things often happened around harry and it was just no good telling the dursleys he didnt make them happenonce aunt petunia tired of harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadnt been at all had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs which she left to hide that horrible scar dudley had laughed himself silly at harry who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glassesnext morning however he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before aunt petunia had sheared it off he had been given a week in his cupboard for this even though he had tried to explain that he couldnt explain how it had grown back so quicklyanother time aunt petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of dudleys brown with orange puff balls the harder she tried to pull it over his head the smaller it seemed to become until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet but certainly wouldnt fit harry aunt petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and to his great relief harry wasnt punishedon the other hand hed gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens dudleys gang had been chasing him as usual when as much to harrys surprise as anyone elses there he was sitting on the chimney the dursleys had received a very angry letter from harrys headmistress telling them harry had been climbing school buildings but all hed tried to do as he shouted at uncle vernon through the locked door of his cupboard was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid jumpbut today nothing was going to go wrong it was even worth being with dudley and piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasnt school his cupboard or mrs figgs cabbagesmelling living roomwhile he drove uncle vernon complained to aunt petunia he liked to complain about things people at work harry the council harry the bank and harry were just a few of his favorite subjects this morning it was motorcyclesroaring along like maniacs the young hoodlums he said as a motorcycle overtook themi had a dream about a motorcycle said harry remembering suddenly it was flyinguncle vernon nearly crashed into the car in front he turned right around in his seat and yelled at harry his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache motorcycles dont flydudley and piers sniggeredi know they dont said harry it was only a dreambut he wished he hadnt said anything if there was one thing the dursleys hated even more than his asking questions it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldnt no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideasit was a very sunny saturday and the zoo was crowded with families the dursleys bought dudley and piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then because the smiling lady in the van had asked harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop it wasnt bad either harry thought licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like dudley except that it wasnt blondharry had the best morning hed had in a long time he was careful to walk a little way apart from the dursleys so that dudley and piers who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime wouldnt fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him they ate in the zoo restaurant and when dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didnt have enough ice cream on top uncle vernon bought him another one and harry was allowed to finish the firstharry felt afterward that he should have known it was all too good to lastafter lunch they went to the reptile house it was cool and dark in there with lit windows all along the walls behind the glass all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone dudley and piers wanted to see huge poisonous cobras and thick mancrushing pythons dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place it could have wrapped its body twice around uncle vernons car and crushed it into a trash can but at the moment it didnt look in the mood in fact it was fast asleepdudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass staring at the glistening brown coilsmake it move he whined at his father uncle vernon tapped on the glass but the snake didnt budgedo it again dudley ordered uncle vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles but the snake just snoozed onthis is boring dudley moaned he shuffled awayharry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake he wouldnt have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long it was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom where the only visitor was aunt petunia hammering on the door to wake you up at least he got to visit the rest of the housethe snake suddenly opened its beady eyes slowly very slowly it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with harrysit winkedharry stared then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching they werent he looked back at the snake and winked toothe snake jerked its head toward uncle vernon and dudley then raised its eyes to the ceiling it gave harry a look that said quite plainly i get that all the timei know harry murmured through the glass though he wasnt sure the snake could hear him it must be really annoyingthe snake nodded vigorouslywhere do you come from anyway harry askedthe snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass harry peered at itboa constrictor brazilwas it nice therethe boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and harry read on this specimen was bred in the zoo oh i see so youve never been to brazilas the snake shook its head a deafening shout behind harry made both of them jumpdudley mr dursley come and look at this snake you wont believe what its doingdudley came waddling toward them as fast as he couldout of the way you he said punching harry in the ribs caught by surprise harry fell hard on the concrete floor what came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened one second piers and dudley were leaning right up close to the glass the next they had leapt back with howls of horrorharry sat up and gasped the glass front of the boa constrictors tank had vanished the great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly slithering out onto the floor people throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exitsas the snake slid swiftly past him harry could have sworn a low hissing voice said brazil here i come thanksss amigothe keeper of the reptile house was in shockbut the glass he kept saying where did the glass gothe zoo director himself made aunt petunia a cup of strong sweet tea while he apologized over and over again piers and dudley could only gibber as far as harry had seen the snake hadnt done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed but by the time they were all back in uncle vernons car dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg while piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death but worst of all for harry at least was piers calming down enough to say harry was talking to it werent you harryuncle vernon waited until piers was safely out of the house before starting on harry he was so angry he could hardly speak he managed to say go cupboard stay no meals before he collapsed into a chair and aunt petunia had to run and get him a large brandyharry lay in his dark cupboard much later wishing he had a watch he didnt know what time it was and he couldnt be sure the dursleys were asleep yet until they were he couldnt risk sneaking to the kitchen for some foodhed lived with the dursleys almost ten years ten miserable years as long as he could remember ever since hed been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash he couldnt remember being in the car when his parents had died sometimes when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard he came up with a strange vision a blinding flash of green light and a burn ing pain on his forehead this he supposed was the crash though he couldnt imagine where all the green light came from he couldnt remember his parents at all his aunt and uncle never spoke about them and of course he was forbidden to ask questions there were no photographs of them in the housewhen he had been younger harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away but it had never happened the dursleys were his only family yet sometimes he thought or maybe hoped that strangers in the street seemed to know him very strange strangers they were too a tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with aunt petunia and dudley after asking harry furiously if he knew the man aunt petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything a wildlooking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus a bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word the weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second harry tried to get a closer lookat school harry had no one everybody knew that dudleys gang hated that odd harry potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses and nobody liked to disagree with dudleys gangchapter threethe letters from no onethe escape of the brazilian boa constrictor earned harry his longestever punishment by the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again the summer holidays had started and dudley had already broken his new video camera crashed his remote control airplane and first time out on his racing bike knocked down old mrs figg as she crossed privet drive on her crutchesharry was glad school was over but there was no escaping dudleys gang who visited the house every single day piers dennis malcolm and gordon were all big and stupid but as dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot he was the leader the rest of them were all quite happy to join in dudleys favorite sport harry huntingthis was why harry spent as much time as possible out of the house wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays where he could see a tiny ray of hope when september came he would be going off to secondary school and for the first time in his life he wouldnt be with dudley dudley had been accepted at uncle vernons old private school smeltings piers polkiss was going there too harry on the other hand was going to stonewall high the local public school dudley thought this was very funnythey stuff peoples heads down the toilet the first day at stonewallhe told harry want to come upstairs and practiceno thanks said harry the poor toilets never had anything as horrible as your head down it it might be sick then he ran before dudley could work out what hed saidone day in july aunt petunia took dudley to london to buy his smeltings uniform leaving harry at mrs figgs mrs figg wasn t as bad as usual it turned out shed broken her leg tripping over one of her cats and she didnt seem quite as fond of them as before she let harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though shed had it for several yearsthat evening dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brandnew uniform smeltings boys wore maroon tailcoats orange knickerbockers and flat straw hats called boaters they also carried knobbly sticks used for hitting each other while the teachers werent looking this was supposed to be good training for later lifeas he looked at dudley in his new knickerbockers uncle vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life aunt petunia burst into tears and said she couldnt believe it was her ickle dudleykins he looked so handsome and grownup harry didnt trust himself to speak he thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laughthere was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when harry went in for breakfast it seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink he went to have a look the tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray waterwhats this he asked aunt petunia her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a questionyour new school uniform she saidharry looked in the bowl againoh he said i didnt realize it had to be so wetdota be stupid snapped aunt petunia im dyeing some of dudleys old things gray for you itll look just like everyone elses when ive finishedharry seriously doubted this but thought it best not to argue he sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at stonewall high like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin probablydudley and uncle vernon came in both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from harrys new uniform uncle vernon opened his newspaper as usual and dudley banged his smelting stick which he carried everywhere on the tablethey heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormatget the mail dudley said uncle vernon from behind his papermake harry get itget the mail harrymake dudley get itpoke him with your smelting stick dudleyharry dodged the smelting stick and went to get the mail three things lay on the doormat a postcard from uncle vernons sister marge who was vacationing on the isle of wight a brown envelope that looked like a bill and a letter for harryharry picked it up and stared at it his heart twanging like a giant elastic band no one ever in his whole life had written to him who would he had no friends no other relatives he didnt belong to the library so hed never even got rude notes asking for books back yet here it was a letter addressed so plainly there could be no mistake mr h potter the cupboard under the stairs privet drive little whinging surrey the envelope was thick and heavy made of yellowish parchment and the address was written in emeraldgreen ink there was no stampturning the envelope over his hand trembling harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms a lion an eagle a badger and a snake surrounding a large letter hhurry up boy shouted uncle vernon from the kitchen what are you doing checking for letter bombs he chuckled at his own jokeharry went back to the kitchen still staring at his letter he handed uncle vernon the bill and the postcard sat down and slowly began to open the yellow envelopeuncle vernon ripped open the bill snorted in disgust and flipped over the postcardmarges ill he informed aunt petunia ate a funny whelk dad said dudley suddenly dad harrys got somethingharry was on the point of unfolding his letter which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by uncle vernonthats mine said harry trying to snatch it backwhod be writing to you sneered uncle vernon shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it his face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights and it didnt stop there within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridgepppetunia he gaspeddudley tried to grab the letter to read it but uncle vernon held it high out of his reach aunt petunia took it curiously and read the first line for a moment it looked as though she might faint she clutched her throat and made a choking noisevernon oh my goodness vernonthey stared at each other seeming to have forgotten that harry and dudley were still in the room dudley wasnt used to being ignored he gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his smelting sticki want to read that letter he said loudly want to read it said harry furiously as its mineget out both of you croaked uncle vernon stuffing the letter back inside its envelopeharry didnt movei want my letter he shoutedlet me see it demanded dudleyout roared uncle vernon and he took both harry and dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall slamming the kitchen door behind them harry and dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole dudley won so harry his glasses dangling from one ear lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floorvernon aunt petunia was saying in a quivering voice look at the address how could they possibly know where he sleeps you dont think theyre watching the housewatching spying might be following us muttered uncle vernon wildlybut what should we do vernon should we write back tell them we dont want harry could see uncle vernons shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchenno he said finally no well ignore it if they dont get an answer yes thats best we wont do anythingbut im not having one in the house petunia didnt we swear when we took him in wed stamp out that dangerous nonsensethat evening when he got back from work uncle vernon did something hed never done before he visited harry in his cupboardwheres my letter said harry the moment uncle vernon had squeezed through the door whos writing to meno one it was addressed to you by mistake said uncle vernon shortlyi have burned itit was not a mistake said harry angrily it had my cupboard on itsilence yelled uncle vernon and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling he took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile which looked quite painfuler yes harry about this cupboard your aunt and i have been thinking youre really getting a bit big for it we think it might be nice if you moved into dudleys second bedroomwhy said harrydont ask questions snapped his uncle take this stuff upstairs nowthe dursleys house had four bedrooms one for uncle vernon and aunt petunia one for visitors usually uncle vernons sister marge one where dudley slept and one where dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldnt fit into his first bedroom it only took harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room he sat down on the bed and stared around him nearly everything in here was broken the monthold video camera was lying on top of a small working tank dudley had once driven over the next door neighbors dog in the corner was dudleys firstever television set which hed put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled there was a large birdcage which had once held a parrot that dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because dudley had sat on it other shelves were full of books they were the only things in the room that looked as though theyd never been touchedfrom downstairs came the sound of dudley bawling at his mother i dont want him in there i need that room make him get outharry sighed and stretched out on the bed yesterday hed have given anything to be up here today hed rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without itnext morning at breakfast everyone was rather quiet dudley was in shock hed screamed whacked his father with his smelting stick been sick on purpose kicked his mother and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof and he still didnt have his room back harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing hed opened the letter in the hall uncle vernon and aunt petunia kept looking at each other darklywhen the mail arrived uncle vernon who seemed to be trying to be nice to harry made dudley go and get it they heard him banging things with his smelting stick all the way down the hall then he shouted theres another one mr h potter the smallest bedroom privet drive Ã¢â‚¬Å“with a strangled cry uncle vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall harry right behind him uncle vernon had to wrestle dudley to the ground to get the letter from him which was made difficult by the fact that harry had grabbed uncle vernon around the neck from behind after a minute of confused fighting in which everyone got hit a lot by the smelting stick uncle vernon straightened up gasping for breath with harrys letter clutched in his handgo to your cupboard i mean your bedroom he wheezed at harrydudley go just goharry walked round and round his new room someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadnt received his first letter surely that meant theyd try again and this time hed make sure they didnt fail he had a planthe repaired alarm clock rang at six oclock the next morning harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently he mustnt wake the dursleys he stole downstairs without turning on any of the lightshe was going to wait for the postman on the corner of privet drive and get the letters for number four first his heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door harry leapt into the air hed trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat something alive lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror harry realized that the big squashy something had been his uncles face uncle vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag clearly making sure that harry didnt do exactly what hed been trying to do he shouted at harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back the mail had arrived right into uncle vernons lapharry could see three letters addressed in green inki want he began but uncle vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes uncle vernon didnt go to work that day he stayed at home and nailed up the mail slotsee he explained to aunt petunia through a mouthful of nails if they cant deliver them theyll just give upim not sure thatll work vernonoh these peoples minds work in strange ways petunia theyre not like you and me said uncle vernon trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake aunt petunia had just brought himon friday no less than twelve letters arrived for harry as they couldnt go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door slotted through the sides and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroomuncle vernon stayed at home again after burning all the letters he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out he hummed tiptoe through the tulipsas he worked and jumped at small noiseson saturday things began to get out of hand twentyfour letters to harry found their way into the house rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed aunt petunia through the living room window while uncle vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to aunt petunia shredded the letters in her food processorwho on earth wants to talk to you this badly dudley asked harry in amazementon sunday morning uncle vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill but happyno post on sundays he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers no damn letters today something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head next moment thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets the dursleys ducked but harry leapt into the air trying to catch oneout outuncle vernon seized harry around the waist and threw him into the hallwhen aunt petunia and dudley had run out with their arms over their faces uncle vernon slammed the door shut they could hear the letters still streaming into the room bouncing off the walls and floorthat does it said uncle vernon trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time i want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave were going away just pack some clothes no argumentshe looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boardedup doors and were in the car speeding toward the highwaydudley was sniffling in the back seat his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television vcr and computer in his sports bagthey drove and they drove even aunt petunia didnt dare ask where they were going every now and then uncle vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while shakeem off shake em off he would mutter whenever he did thisthey didnt stop to eat or drink all day by nightfall dudley was howling hed never had such a bad day in his life he was hungry hed missed five television programs hed wanted to see and hed never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computeruncle vernon stopped at last outside a gloomylooking hotel on the outskirts of a big city dudley and harry shared a room with twin beds and damp musty sheets dudley snored but harry stayed awake sitting on the windowsill staring down at the lights of passing cars and wonderingthey ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day they had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their tablescuse me but is one of you mr h potter only i got about an undred of these at the front deskshe held up a letter so they could read the green ink address mr h potter room railview hotel cokeworth harry made a grab for the letter but uncle vernon knocked his hand out of the way the woman staredill take them said uncle vernon standing up quickly and following her from the dining roomwouldnt it be better just to go home dear aunt petunia suggested timidly hours later but uncle vernon didnt seem to hear her exactly what he was looking for none of them knew he drove them into the middle of a forest got out looked around shook his head got back in the car and off they went again the same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field halfway across a suspension bridge and at the top of a multilevel parking garagedaddys gone mad hasnt he dudley asked aunt petunia dully late that afternoon uncle vernon had parked at the coast locked them all inside the car and disappearedit started to rain great drops beat on the roof of the car dud ley sniveledits monday he told his mother the great humbertos on tonight i want to stay somewhere with a television Ã¢â‚¬Å“monday this reminded harry of something if it was monday and you could usually count on dudley to know the days the week because of television then tomorrow tuesday was harrys eleventh birthday of course his birthdays were never exactly fun last year the dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of uncle vernons old socksstill you werent eleven every dayuncle vernon was back and he was smiling he was also carrying a long thin package and didnt answer aunt petunia when she asked what hed boughtfound the perfect place he said come on everyone outit was very cold outside the car uncle vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine one thing was certain there was no television in therestorm forecast for tonight said uncle vernon gleefully clapping his hands together and this gentlemans kindly agreed to lend us his boata toothless old man came ambling up to them pointing with a rather wicked grin at an old rowboat bobbing in the irongray water below themive already got us some rations said uncle vernon so all aboardit was freezing in the boat icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces after what seemed like hours they reached the rock where uncle vernon slipping and sliding led the way to the brokendown housethe inside was horrible it smelled strongly of seaweed the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls and the fireplace was damp and empty there were only two roomsuncle vernons rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas he tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled upcould do with some of those letters now eh he said cheerfullyhe was in a very good mood obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail harry privately agreed though the thought didnt cheer him up at allas night fell the promised storm blew up around them spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows aunt petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for dudley on the motheaten sofa she and uncle vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door and harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest most ragged blanketthe storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on harry couldnt sleep he shivered and turned over trying to get comfortable his stomach rumbling with hunger dudleys snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight the lighted dial of dudleys watch which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist told harry hed be eleven in ten minutes time he lay and watched his birthday tick nearer wondering if the dursleys would remember at all wondering where the letter writer was nowfive minutes to go harry heard something creak outside he hoped the roof wasnt going to fall in although he might be warmer if it didfour minutes to go maybe the house in privet drive would be so full of letters when they got back that hed be able to steal one somehowthree minutes to go was that the sea slapping hard on the rock like that and two minutes to go what was that funny crunching noise was the rock crumbling into the sea one minute to go and hed be eleven thirty seconds twenty tennine maybe hed wake dudley up just to annoy him three twooneboomthe whole shack shivered and harry sat bolt upright staring at the door someone was outside knocking to come inchapter fourthe keeper of the keysboom they knocked again dudley jerked awake wheres the cannon he said stupidlythere was a crash behind them and uncle vernon came skidding into the room he was holding a rifle in his hands now they knew what had been in the long thin package he had brought with themwhos there he shouted i warn you im armedthere was a pause then Ã¢â‚¬â€œsmashthe door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floora giant of a man was standing in the doorway his face was almost completely hidden by a long shaggy mane of hair and a wild tangled beard but you could make out his eyes glinting like black beetles under all the hairthe giant squeezed his way into the hut stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling he bent down picked up the door and fitted it easily back into its frame the noise of the storm outside dropped a little he turned to look at them allcouldnt make us a cup o tea could yeh its not been an easy journeyhe strode over to the sofa where dudley sat frozen with fearbudge up yeh great lump said the strangerdudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother who was crouching terrified behind uncle vernonan heres harry said the giantharry looked up into the fierce wild shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smilelas time i saw you you was only a baby said the giant yeh look a lot like yet dad but yehve got yet moms eyesuncle vernon made a funny rasping noisei demand that you leave at once sit he said you are breaking and enteringah shut up dursley yeh great prune said the giant he reached over the back of the sofa jerked the gun out of uncle vernons hands bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber and threw it into a corner of the roomuncle vernon made another funny noise like a mouse being trodden onanyway harry said the giant turning his back on the dursleys a very happy birthday to yeh got summat fer yeh here i mighta sat on it at some point but itll taste all rightfrom an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed box harry opened it with trembling fingers inside was a large sticky chocolate cake with happy birthday harry written on it in green icingharry looked up at the giant he meant to say thank you but the words got lost on the way to his mouth and what he said instead was who are youthe giant chuckledtrue i havent introduced meself rubeus hagrid keeper of keys and grounds at hogwartshe held out an enormous hand and shook harrys whole armwhat about that tea then eh he said rubbing his hands togetherid not say no ter summat stronger if yehve got it mindhis eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he snorted he bent down over the fireplace they couldnt see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later there was a roaring fire there it filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and harry felt the warmth wash over him as though hed sunk into a hot baththe giant sat back down on the sofa which sagged under his weight and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat a copper kettle a squashy package of sausages a poker a teapot several chipped mugs and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage nobody said a thing while the giant was working but as he slid the first six fat juicy slightly burnt sausages from the poker dudley fidgeted a little uncle vernon said sharply dont touch anything he gives you dudleythe giant chuckled darklyyet great puddin of a son don need fattenin anymore dursley don worryhe passed the sausages to harry who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful but he still couldnt take his eyes off the giant finally as nobody seemed about to explain anything he said im sorry but i still dont really know who you arethe giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his handcall me hagrid he said everyone does an like i told yeh im keeper of keys at hogwarts yehll know all about hogwarts o courseer no said harryhagrid looked shockedsorry harry said quicklysony barked

after a few minutes he stammered what does it mean they await my owlgallopin gorgons that reminds me said hagrid clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl a real live rather ruffledlooking owl a long quill and a roll of parchmentwith his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that harry could read upside down dear professor dumbledore given harry his lettertaking him to buy his things tomorrowweathers horrible hope youre wellhagrid hagrid rolled up the note gave it to the owl which clamped it in its beak went to the door and threw the owl out into the storm then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephoneharry realized his mouth was open and closed

an james potter its an outrage a scandal harry potter not knowin his own story when every kid in our world knows his name but why what happened harry asked urgentlythe anger faded from hagrids face he

some o the best witches an wizards of the age the mckinnons the bones the prewetts an you was only a baby an you livedsomething very painful was going on in harrys mind as hagrids story came to a close he saw again the blinding flash of green light more clearly than he had ever remembered it before and he remembered something else for the first time in his life a high cold cruel laughhagrid was watching him sadlytook yeh from the ruined house myself on dumbledores orders brought yeh ter this lotload of old tosh said uncle vernon harry jumped he had almost forgotten that the dursleys were there uncle vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage he was glaring at hagrid and his fists were clenchednow you listen here boy he snarled i accept theres something strange about you probably nothing a good beating wouldnt have cured and as for all this about your parents well they were weirdos no denying it and the worlds better off without them in my opinion asked for all they got getting mixed up with these wizarding types just what i expected always knew theyd come to a sticky end but at that moment hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat pointing this at uncle vernon like a sword he said im warning you dursley im warning you one more word Ã¢â‚¬Å“in danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant uncle vernons courage failed again he flattened himself against the wall and fell silentthats better said hagrid breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa which this time sagged right down to the floorharry meanwhile still had questions to ask hundreds of thembut what happened to vol sorry i mean youknowwhogood question harry disappeared vanished same night he tried ter kill you makes yeh even more famous thats the biggest mystry seehe was gettin more an more powerful whyd he go some say he died codswallop in my opinion dunno if he had enough human left in him to die some say hes still out there bidin his time like but i don believe it people who was on his side came back ter ours some of em came outta kinda trances don reckon they couldve done if he was comin backmost of us reckon hes still out there somewhere but lost his powerstoo weak to carry on cause somethin about you finished him harrythere was somethin goin on that night he hadnt counted on i dunno what it was no one does but somethin about you stumped him all righthagrid looked at harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes but harry instead of feeling pleased and proud felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake a wizard him how could he possibly be hed spent his life being clouted by dudley and bullied by aunt petunia and uncle vernon if he was really a wizard why hadnt they been turned into warty toads every time theyd tried to lock him in his cupboard if hed once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world how come dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football hagrid he said quietly i think you must have made a mistake i dont think i can be a wizardto his surprise hagrid chucklednot a wizard eh never made things happen when you was scared or angryharry looked into the fire now he came to think about it every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he harry had been upset or angry chased by dudleys gang he had somehow found himself out of their reach dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut hed managed to make it grow back and the very last time dudley had hit him hadnt he got his revenge without even realizing he was doing it hadnt he set a boa constrictor on him harry looked back at hagrid smiling and saw that hagrid was positively beaming at himsee said hagrid harry potter not a wizard you wait youll be right famous at hogwartsbut uncle vernon wasnt going to give in without a fighthavent i told you hes not going he hissed hes going to stonewall high and hell be grateful for it ive read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish spell books and wands and if he wants ter go a great muggle like you wont stop him growled hagrid stop lily an james potter s son goin ter hogwarts yer madhis

change an hell be under the greatest headmaster hogwarts ever had albus dumbledi am not paying for some crackpot old fool to teach him magic tricksyelled uncle vernonbut he had finally gone too far hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it over his head never he thundered insult albus dumbledorein front of mehe brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at dudley there was a flash of violet light a sound like a firecracker a sharp squeal and the next second dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom howling in pain when he turned his back on them harry saw a curly pigs tail poking through a hole in his trousersuncle vernon roared pulling aunt petunia and dudley into the other room he cast one last terrified look at hagrid and slammed the door behind themhagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beardshouldnta lost me temper he said ruefully but it didnt work anyway meant ter turn him into a pig but i suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there wasnt much left ter dohe cast a sideways look at harry under his bushy eyebrowsbe grateful if yeh didnt mention that ter anyone at hogwarts he said im er not supposed ter do

right harry mumbled im getting uphe sat up and hagrids heavy coat fell off him the hut was full of sunlight the storm was over hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window a newspaper held in its beakharry scrambled to his feet so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him he went straight to the window and jerked it open the owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of hagrid who didnt wake up the owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack hagrids coatdont do thatharry tried to wave the owl out of the way but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coathagrid said harry loudly theres an owl pay him hagrid grunted into the sofawhathe wants payin fer deliverin the paper look in the pocketshagrids coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets bunches of keys slug pellets balls of string peppermint humbugs teabagsfinally harry pulled out a handful of strangelooking coinsgive him five knuts said hagrid sleepilyknutsthe little bronze onesharry counted out five little bronze coins and the owl held out his leg so harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it then he flew off through the open windowhagrid yawned loudly sat up and stretchedbest be off harry lots ter do today gotta get up ter london an buy all yer stuff fer schoolharry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them he had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had got a punctureum hagridmm said hagrid who was pulling on his huge bootsi havent got any money and you heard uncle vernon last night he wont pay for me to go and learn magicdont worry about that said hagrid standing up and scratching his head dyeh think yer

thenharry followed hagrid out onto the rock the sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight the boat uncle vernon had hired was still there with a lot of water in the bottom after the stormhow did you get here harry asked looking around for another boatflew said hagridflewyeah but well go back in this not spposed ter use magic now ive got yehthey settled down in the boat harry still staring at hagrid trying to imagine him flyingseems a shame ter row though said hagrid giving harry another of his sideways looks if i was ter er speed things up a bit would yeh mind not mentionin it at hogwartsof course not said harry eager to see more magic hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again tapped it twice on the side of the boat and they sped off toward landwhy would you be

gringotts is hundreds of miles under london see deep under the underground yehd die of hunger tryin ter get out even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summatharry sat and thought about this while hagrid read his newspaper the daily prophet harry had learned from uncle vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this but it was very difficult hed never had so many questions in his lifeministry o magic messin things up as usual hagrid muttered turning the pagetheres a ministry of magic harry asked before he could stop himselfcourse said hagrid they wanted dumbledore fer minister course but hed never leave hogwarts so old cornelius fudge got the job bungler if ever there was one so he pelts dumbledore with owls every morning askin fer advicebut what does a ministry of magic dowell their main job is to keep it from the muggles that theres still witches an wizards up an down the countrywhywhy blimey harry everyoned be wantin magic solutions to their problems nah were best left aloneat this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall hagrid folded up his newspaper and they clambered up the stone steps onto the streetpassersby stared a lot at hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station harry couldnt blame them not only was hagrid twice as tall as anyone else he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly see that harry things these muggles dream up ehhagrid said harry panting a bit as he ran to keep up did you say there are dragons at gringottswell so they say said hagrid crikey id like a dragonyoud like onewanted one ever since i was a kid here we gothey had reached the station there was a train to london in five minutes time hagrid who didnt understand muggle money as he called it gave the bills to harry so he could buy their ticketspeople stared more than ever on the train hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canaryyellow circus tentstill got yer letter harry he asked as he counted stitches harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocketgood said hagrid theres a list there of everything yeh needharry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadnt noticed the night before and read hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry uniform firstyear students will require three sets of plain work robes black one plain pointed hat black for day wear one pair of protective

years are not allowed their own broomsticks can we buy all this in london harry wondered aloudif yeh know where to go said hagridharry had never been to london before although hagrid seemed to know where he was going he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way he got stuck in the ticket barrier on the underground and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slowi dont know how the muggles manage without magic he said as they climbed a brokendown escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shopshagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily all harry had to do was keep close behind him they passed book shops and music stores hamburger restaurants and cinemas but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand this was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks might this not all be some huge joke that the dursleys had cooked up if harry hadnt known that the dursleys had no sense of humor he might have thought so yet somehow even though everything hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable harry couldnt help trusting himthis is it said hagrid coming to a halt the leaky cauldron its a famous placeit was a tiny grubbylooking pub if hagrid hadnt pointed it out harry wouldnt have noticed it was there the people hurrying by didnt glance at it their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldnt see the leaky cauldron at all in fact harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and hagrid could see it before he could mention this hagrid had steered him insidefor a famous place it was very dark and shabby a few old women were sitting in a corner drinking tiny glasses of sherry one of them was smoking a long pipe a little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut the low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in everyone seemed to know hagrid they waved and smiled at him and the bartender reached for a glass saying the usual hagridcant tom im on hogwarts business said hagrid clapping his great hand on harrys shoulder and making harrys knees bucklegood lord said the bartender peering at harry is this can this be the leaky cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silentbless my soul whispered the old bartender harry potter what an honorhe hurried out from behind the bar rushed toward harry and seized his hand tears in his eyeswelcome back mr potter welcome backharry didnt know what to say everyone was looking at him the old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone outhagrid was beamingthen there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the leaky cauldrondoris crockford mr potter cant believe im meeting you at lastso proud mr potter im just so proudalways wanted to shake your hand im all of a flutterdelighted mr potter just cant tell you diggles the name dedalus diggleive seen you before said harry as dedalus diggles top

crockford kept coming back for morea pale young man made his way forward very nervously one of his eyes was twitchingprofessor quirrell said hagrid harry professor quirrell will be one of your teachers at hogwartspppotter stammered professor quirrell grasping harrys hand ccant ttell you how p pleased i am to meet youwhat sort of magic do you teach professor quirrellddefense against the

last hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babblemust get on lots ter buy come on harrydoris crockford shook harrys hand one last time and hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small walled courtyard where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weedshagrid grinned at harrytold yeh didnt i told yeh you was famous even professor quirrell was tremblin ter meet yeh mind you hes usually tremblinis he always that nervousoh yeah poor bloke brilliant mind he was fine while he was studyin outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience they say he met vampires in the black forest and there was a nasty bit o trouble with a hag never been the same sincescared of the students scared of his own subject now wheres me umbrellavampires hags harrys head was swimming hagrid meanwhile was counting bricks in the wall above the trash canthree up two across he muttered right stand back harryhe tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrellathe brick he had touched quivered it wriggled in the middle a small hole appeared it grew wider and wider a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for hagrid an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sightwelcome said hagrid to diagon alleyhe grinned at harrys amazement they stepped through the archway harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wallthe sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shopcauldrons all sizes copper brass pewter silver selfstirring collapsible said a sign hanging over themyeah youll be needin one said hagrid but we gotta get yer money firstharry wished he had about eight more eyes he turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street trying to look at everything at once the shops the things outside them the people doing their shopping a plump woman outside an apothecary was shaking her head as they passed saying dragon liver seventeen sickles an ounce theyre mada low soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying eeylops owl emporium tawny screech barn brown and snowy several boys of about harrys age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it look harry heard one of them say the new nimbus two thousand fastest ever there were shops selling robes shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments harry had never seen before windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels eyes tottering piles of spell books quills and rolls of parchment potion bottles globes of the moongringotts said hagridthey had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops standing beside its burnished bronze doors wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold was yeah thats a goblin said hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him the goblin was about a head shorter than harryhe had a swarthy clever face a pointed beard and harry noticed very long fingers and feet he bowed as they walked inside now they were facing a second pair of doors silver this time with words engraved upon them enter stranger but take heed of what awaits the sin of greed for those who take but do not earn must pay most dearly in their turnso if you seek beneath our floors a treasure that was never yours thief you have been warned beware of finding more than treasure therelike i said yehd be mad ter try an rob it said hagrida pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall about a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter scribbling in large ledgers weighing coins in brass scales examining precious stones through eyeglassesthere were too many doors to count leading off the hall and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these hagrid and harry made for the countermorning said hagrid to a free goblin weve come ter take some money outta mr harry potters safeyou have his key sirgot it here somewhere said hagrid and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblins book of numbers the goblin wrinkled his nose harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coalsgot it said hagrid at last holding up a tiny golden keythe goblin looked at it closelythat seems to be in orderan ive also got a letter here from professor dumbledore said hagrid importantly throwing out his chest its about the youknowwhat in vault seven hundred and thirteenthe goblin read the letter carefullyvery well he said handing it back to hagrid i will have someone take you down to both vaults griphookgriphook was yet another goblin once hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets he and harry followed griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hallwhats the youknowwhat in vault seven hundred and thirteen harry askedcant tell yeh that said hagrid mysteriously very secret hogwarts business dumbledores trusted me moren my jobs worth ter tell yeh thatgriphook held the door open for them harry who had expected more marble was surprised they were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches it sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them they climbed in hagrid with some difficulty and were offat first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages harry tried to remember left right right left middle fork right left but it was impossible the rattling cart seemed to know its own way because griphook wasnt steeringharrys eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them but he kept them wide open once he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon but too late they plunged even deeper passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floori never know harry called to hagrid over the noise of the cart whats the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactitestalagmites got an m in it said hagrid an don ask me questions just now i think im gonna be sickhe did look very green and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from tremblinggriphook unlocked the door a lot of green smoke came billowing out and as it cleared harry gasped inside were mounds of gold coins columns of silver heaps of little bronze knutsall yours smiled hagridall harrys it was incredible the dursleys couldnt have known about this or theyd have had it from him faster than blinking how often had they complained how much harry cost them to keep and all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him buried deep under londonhagrid helped harry pile some of it into a bagthe gold ones are galleons he explained seventeen silver sickles to a galleon and twentynine knuts to a sickle its easy enough right that should be enough fer a couple o terms well keep the rest safe for yeh he turned to griphook vault seven hundred and thirteen now please and can we go more slowlyone speed only said griphookthey were going even deeper now and gathering speed the air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners they went rattling over an underground ravine and harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom but hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neckvault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyholestand back said griphook importantly he stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted awayif anyone but a gringotts goblin tried that theyd be sucked through the door and trapped in there said griphookhow often do you check to see if anyones inside harry askedabout once every ten years said griphook with a rather nasty grinsomething really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault harry was sure and he leaned forward eagerly expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least but at first he thought it was empty then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat harry longed to know what it was but knew better than to askcome on back in this infernal cart and dont talk to me on the way back its best if i keep me mouth shut said hagridone wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside gringotts harry didnt know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money he didnt have to know how many galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than hed had in his whole life more money than even dudley had ever hadmight as well get yer uniform said hagrid nodding toward madam malkins robes for all occasions listen harry would yeh mind if i slipped off fer a pickmeup in the leaky cauldron i hate them gringotts carts he did still look a bit sick so harry entered madam malkins shop alone feeling nervousmadam malkin was a squat smiling witch dressed all in mauvehogwarts clear she said when harry started to speak got the lot here another young man being fitted up just now in fact Ã¢â‚¬Å“in the back of the shop a boy with a pale pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes madam malkin stood harry on a stool next to him slipped a long robe over his head and began to pin it to the right lengthhello said the boy hogwarts tooyes said harrymy fathers next door buying my books and mothers up the street looking at wands said the boy he had a bored drawling voice then im going to drag them off to took at racing brooms i dont see why first years cant have their own i think ill bully father into getting me one and ill smuggle it in somehowharry was strongly reminded of dudleyhave you got your own broom the boy went onno said harryplay quidditch at allno harry said again wondering what on earth quidditch could bei do father says its a crime if im not picked to play for my house and i must say i agree know what house youll be in yetno said harry feeling more stupid by the minutewell no one really knows until they get there do they but i know ill be in slytherin all our family have been imagine being in hufflepuff i think id leave wouldnt you mmm said harry wishing he could say something a bit more interestingi say look at that man said the boy suddenly nodding toward the front window hagrid was standing there grinning at harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldnt come inthats hagrid said harry pleased to know something the boy didnthe works at hogwartsoh said the boy ive heard of him hes a sort of servant isnt hehes the gamekeeper said harry he was liking the boy less and less every secondyes exactly i heard hes a sort of savage lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk tries to do magic and ends up setting fire to his bedi think hes brilliant said harry coldlydo you said the boy with a slight sneer why is he with you where are your parentstheyre dead said harry shortly he didnt feel much like going into the matter with this boyoh sorry said the other not sounding sorry at all but they were our kind werent theythey were a witch and wizard if thats what you meani really dont think they should let the other sort in do you theyre just not the same theyve never been brought up to know our ways some of them have never even heard of hogwarts until they get the letter imagine i think they should keep it in the old wizarding familieswhats your surname anywaybut before harry could answer madam malkin said thats you done my dear and harry not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy hopped down from the footstoolwell ill see you at hogwarts i suppose said the drawling boyharry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream hagrid had bought him chocolate and raspberry with chopped nutswhats up said hagridnothing harry lied they stopped to buy parchment and quills harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote when they had left the shop he said hagrid whats quidditchblimey harry i keep forgettin how little yeh know not knowin about quidditchdont make me feel worse said harry he told hagrid about the pate boy in madam malkinsand he said people from muggle families shouldnt even be allowed inyer not from a muggle family if hed known who yeh were hes grown up knowin yer name if his parents are wizardin folk you saw what everyone in the leaky cauldron was like when they saw yeh anyway what does he know about it some o the best i ever saw were the only ones with magic in em in a long line muggles look at yer mum look what she had fer a sisterso what is quidditchits our sport wizard sport its like like soccer in the muggle world everyone follows quidditch played up in the air on broomsticks and theres four balls sorta hard ter explain the rulesand what are slytherin and hufflepuffschool houses theres four everyone says hufflepuff are a lot o duffers but i bet im in hufflepuff said harry gloomilybetter hufflepuff than slytherin said hagrid darkly theres not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasnt in slytherinyouknowwho was onevol sorry youknowwho was at hogwartsyears an years ago said hagridthey bought harrys school books in a shop called flourish and blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all even dudley who never read anything would have been wild to get his hands on some of these hagrid almost had to drag harry away from curses and countercurses bewitch your friends and befuddle your enemies with the latest revenges hair loss jellylegs tongue tying and much much more by professor vindictus viridiani was trying to find out how to curse dudleyim not sayin thats not a good idea but yer not ter use magic in the muggle world except in very special circumstances said hagrid an anyway yeh couldn work any of them curses yet yehll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that levelhagrid wouldnt let harry buy a solid gold cauldron either it says pewter on yer list but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope then they visited the apothecary which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor jars of herbs dried roots and bright powders lined the walls bundles of feathers strings of fangs and snarled claws hung from the ceiling while hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for harry harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twentyone galleons each and minuscule glitteryblack beetle eyes five knuts a scoopoutside the apothecary hagrid checked harrys list againjust yer wand left a yeah an i still havent got yeh a birthday presentharry felt himself go redyou dont have to i know i dont have to tell yeh what ill get yer animal not a toad toads went outta fashion years ago yehd be laughed at an i don like cats they make me sneeze ill get yer an owl all the kids want owls theyre dead useful carry yer mail an everythintwenty minutes later they left eeylops owl emporium which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering jewelbright eyes harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl fast asleep with her head under her wing he couldnt stop stammering his thanks sounding just like professor quirrelldon mention it said hagrid gruffly don expect youve had a lotta presents from them dursleys just ollivanders left now only place fer wands ollivanders and yeh gotta have the best wanda magic wand this was what harry had been really looking forward tothe last shop was narrow and shabby peeling gold letters over the door read ollivanders makers of fine wands since bc a single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty windowa tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside it was a tiny place empty except for a single spindly chair that hagrid sat on to wait harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling for some reason the back of his neck prickled the very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magicgood afternoon said a soft voice harry jumped hagrid must have jumped too because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chairan old man was standing before them his wide pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shophello said harry awkwardlyah yes said the man yes yes i thought id be seeing you soonharry potter it wasnt a question you have your mothers eyes it seems only yesterday she was in here herself buying her first wand ten and a quarter inches long swishy made of willow nice wand for charm workmr ollivander moved closer to harry harry wished he would blink those silvery eyes were a bit creepyyour father on the other hand favored a mahogany wand eleven inchespliable a little more power and excellent for transfiguration well i say your father favored it its really the wand that chooses the wizard of coursemr ollivander had come so close that he and harry were almost nose to nose harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyesand thats wheremr ollivander touched the lightning scar on harrys forehead with a long white fingerim sorry to say i sold the wand that did it he said softlythirteenandahalf inches yew powerful wand very powerful and in the wrong hands well if id known what that wand was going out into the world to dohe shook his head and then to harrys relief spotted hagridrubeus rubeus hagrid how nice to see you again oak sixteen inches rather bendy wasnt itit was sir yes said hagridgood wand that one but i suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled said mr ollivander suddenly sterner yes they did yes said hagrid shuffling his feet ive still got the pieces though he added brightlybut you dont use them said mr ollivander sharplyoh no sit said hagrid quickly harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spokehmmm said mr ollivander giving hagrid a piercing look well now mr potter let me see he pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket which is your wand armer well im righthanded said harryhold out your arm thats it he measured harry from shoulder to finger then wrist to elbow shoulder to floor knee to armpit and round his head as he measured he said every ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance mr potter we use unicorn hairs phoenix tail feathers and the heartstrings of dragons no two ollivander wands are the same just as no two unicorns dragons or phoenixes are quite the same and of course you will never get such good results with another wizards wandharry suddenly realized that the tape measure which was measuring between his nostrils was doing this on its own mr ollivander was flitting around the shelves taking down boxesthat will do he said and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor right then mr potter try this one beechwood and dragon heartstring nine inches nice and flexible just take it and give it a waveharry took the wand and feeling foolish waved it around a bit but mr ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at oncemaple and phoenix feather

inches nice and suppleharry took the wand he felt a sudden warmth in his fingers he raised the wand above his head brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls hagrid whooped and clapped and mr ollivander cried oh bravo yes indeed oh very good well well well how curious how very curious Ã¢â‚¬Å“he put harrys wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper still muttering curious curioussorry said harry but whats curiousmr ollivander fixed harry with his pale starei

remember i think we must expect great things from you mr potter after all he whomustnotbenamed did great things terrible yes but greatharry shivered he wasnt sure he liked mr ollivander too much he paid seven gold galleons for his wand and mr ollivander bowed them from his shopthe late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as harry and hagrid made their way back down diagon alley back through the wall back through the leaky cauldron now empty harry didnt speak at all as they walked down the road he didnt even notice how much people were gawking at them on the underground laden as they were with all their funnyshaped packages with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on harrys lap up another escalator out into paddington station harry only realized where they were when hagrid tapped him on the shouldergot time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves he saidhe bought harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them harry kept looking around everything looked so strange somehowyou all right harry yer very quiet said hagridharry wasnt sure he could explain hed just had the best birthday of his life and yet he chewed his hamburger trying to find the wordseveryone

cant even remember what im famous for i dont know what happened when vol sorry i mean the night my parents diedhagrid leaned across the table behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smiledon you worry harry youll learn fast enough everyone starts at the beginning at hogwarts youll be just fine just be yerself i know its hard yehve been singled out an thats always hard but yehll have a great time at hogwarts i did still do smatter of facthagrid helped harry on to the train that would take him back to the dursleys then handed him an envelopeyer ticket fer hogwarts he said first o september kings cross its all on yer ticket any problems with the dursleys send me a letter with yer owl shell know where to find me see yeh soon harrythe train pulled out of the station harry wanted to watch hagrid until he was out of sight he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window but he blinked and hagrid had gonechapter sixthe journey from platform nine and threequartersharrys last month with the dursleys wasnt fun true dudley was now so scared of harry he wouldnt stay in the same room while aunt petunia and uncle vernon didnt shut harry in his cupboard force him to do anything or shout at him in fact they didnt speak to him at allhalf terrified half furious they acted as though any chair with harry in it were empty although this was an improvement in many ways it did become a bit depressing after a whileharry kept to his room with his new owl for company he had decided to call her hedwig a name he had found in a history of magic his school books were very interesting he lay on his bed reading late into the night hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased it was lucky that aunt petunia didnt come in to vacuum anymore because hedwig kept bringing back dead mice every night before he went to sleep harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall counting down to september the firston the last day of august he thought hed better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to kings cross station the next day so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television he cleared his throat to let them know he was there and dudley screamed and ran from the roomer uncle vernonuncle vernon grunted to show he was listeninger i need to be at kings cross tomorrow to to go to hogwartsuncle vernon grunted againwould it be all right if you gave me a liftgrunt harry supposed that meant yesthank youhe was about to go back upstairs when uncle vernon actually spokefunny way to get to a wizards school the train magic carpets all got punctures have theyharry didnt say anythingwhere is this school anywayi dont know said harry realizing this for the first time he pulled the ticket hagrid had given him out of his pocketi just take the train from platform nine and threequarters at eleven oclock he readhis aunt and uncle staredplatform whatnine and threequartersdont talk rubbish said uncle vernon there is no platform nine and threequartersits on my ticketbarking said uncle vernon howling mad the lot of them youll seeyou just wait all right well take you to kings cross were going up to london tomorrow anyway or i wouldnt botherwhy are you going to london harry asked trying to keep things friendlytaking dudley to the hospital growled uncle vernon got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to smeltingsharry woke at five oclock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep he got up and pulled on his jeans because he didnt want to walk into the station in his wizards robes hed change on the train he checked his hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed saw that hedwig was shut safely in her cage and then paced the room waiting for the dursleys to get up two hours later harrys huge heavy trunk had been loaded into the dursleys car aunt petunia had talked dudley into sitting next to harry and they had set offthey reached kings cross at half past ten uncle vernon dumped harrys trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him harry thought this was strangely kind until uncle vernon stopped dead facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his facewell there you are boy platform nine platform ten your platform should be somewhere in the middle but they dont seem to have built it yet do theyhe was quite right of course there was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it and in the middle nothing at allhave a good term said uncle vernon with an even nastier smile he left without another word harry turned and saw the dursleys drive awayall three of them were laughing harrys mouth went rather dry what on earth was he going to do he was starting to attract a lot of funny looks because of hedwig hed have to ask someonehe stopped a passing guard but didnt dare mention platform nine and threequarters the guard had never heard of hogwarts and when harry couldnt even tell him what part of the country it was in he started to get annoyed as though harry was being stupid on purpose getting desperate harry asked for the train that left at eleven oclock but the guard said there wasnt one in the end the guard strode away muttering about time wasters harry was now trying hard not to panicaccording to the large clock over the arrivals board he had ten minutes left to get on the train to hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift a pocket full of wizard money and a large owlhagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do like tapping the third brick on the left to get into diagon alley he wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspectors stand between platforms nine and tenat that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were sayingpacked with muggles of course harry swung round the speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys all with flaming red hair each of them was pushing a trunk like harrys in front of him and they had an owlheart hammering harry pushed his cart after them they stopped and so did he just near enough to hear what they were sayingnow whats the platform number said the boys mothernine and threequarters piped a small girl also redheaded who was holding her hand mom cant i go Ã¢â‚¬Å“youre not old enough ginny now be quiet all right percy you go firstwhat looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and tenharry watched careful not to blink in case he missed it but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away the boy had vanishedfred you next the plump woman saidim not fred im george said the boy honestly woman you call yourself our mother cara you tell im georgesorry george dearonly joking i am fred said the boy and off he went his twin called after him to hurry up and he must have done so because a second later he had gone but how had he done it now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was almost there and then quite suddenly he wasnt anywherethere was nothing else for itexcuse me harry said to the plump womanhello dear she said first time at hogwarts rons new tooshe pointed at the last and youngest of her sons he was tall thin and gangling with freckles big hands and feet and a long noseyes said harry the thing is the thing is i dont know how to how to get onto the platform she said kindly and harry noddednot to worry she said all you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten dont stop and dont be scared youll crash into it thats very important best do it at a bit of a run if youre nervous go on go now before roner okay said harryhe pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier it looked very solidhe started to walk toward it people jostled him on their way to platforms nine and ten harry walked more quickly he was going to smash right into that barrier and then hed be in trouble leaning forward on his cart he broke into a heavy run the barrier was coming nearer and nearer he wouldnt be able to stop the cart was out of control he was a foot away he closed his eyes ready for the crash it didnt come he kept on running he opened his eyes a scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people a sign overhead said hogwarts express eleven oclock harry looked behind him and saw a wroughtiron archway where the barrier had been with the words platform nine and threequarters on it he had done itsmoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunksthe first few carriages were already packed with students some hanging out of the window to talk to their families some fighting over seatsharry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seathe passed a roundfaced boy who was saying gran ive lost my toad againoh neville he heard the old woman sigha boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowdgive us a look lee go onthe boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long hairy legharry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train he put hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door he tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his footwant a hand it was one of the redhaired twins hed followed through the barrieryes please harry pantedoy fred cmere and helpwith the twins

saw the boys mother waving and their sister half laughing half crying running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed then she fell back and wavedharry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner houses flashed past the window harry felt a great leap of excitement he didnt know what he was going to but it had to be better than what he was leaving behindthe door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came inanyone sitting there he asked pointing at the seat opposite harryeverywhere else is fullharry shook his head and the boy sat down he glanced at harry and then looked quickly out of the window pretending he hadnt looked harry saw he still had a black mark on his nosehey ronthe twins were backlisten were going

doing he looked quickly out of the window againare all your family wizards asked harry who found ron just as interesting as ron found himer yes i think so said ron i think moms got a second cousin whos an accountant but we never talk about himso you must know loads of magic alreadythe weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in diagon alley had talked abouti heard

rat which was asleephis names scabbers and hes useless he hardly ever wakes up percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect but they couldnt aff i mean i got scabbers insteadrons ears went pink he seemed to think hed said too much because he went back to staring out of the windowharry didnt think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl after all hed never had any money in his life until a month ago and he told ron so all about having to wear dudleys old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents this seemed to cheer ron upand until hagrid told me i didnt know anything about be ing a wizard or about my parents or voldemortron gaspedwhat said harryyou said youknowwhos name said ron sounding both shocked and impressed id have thought you of all people im not trying to be brave or anything saying the name said harry i just never knew you shouldnt see what i mean ive got loads to learn i bet he added voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot lately i bet im the worst in the classyou wont be theres loads of people who come from muggle families and they learn quick enoughwhile they had been talking the train had carried them out of londonnow they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep they were quiet for a time watching the fields and lanes flick pastaround half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling dimpled woman slid back their door and said anything off the cart dearsharry who hadnt had any breakfast leapt to his feet but rons ears went pink again and he muttered that hed brought sandwiches harry went out into the corridorhe had never had any money for candy with the dursleys and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many mars bars as he could carry but the woman didnt have mars bars what she did have were bettie botts every flavor beans droobles best blowing gum chocolate frogs pumpkin pasties cauldron cakes licorice wands and a number of other strange things harry had never seen in his life not wanting to miss anything he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver sickles and seven bronze knutsron stared as harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seathungry are youstarving said harry taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pastyron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it there were four sandwiches inside he pulled one of them apart and said she always forgets i dont like corned beefswap you for one of these said harry holding up a pasty go on you dont want this its all dry said ron she hasnt got much time he added quickly you know with five of usgo on have a pasty said harry who had never had anything to share before or indeed anyone to share it with it was a nice feeling sitting there with ron eating their way through all harrys pasties cakes and candies the sandwiches lay forgottenwhat are these harry asked ron holding up a pack of chocolate frogstheyre not really frogs are they he was starting to feel that nothing would surprise himno said ron but see what the card is im missing agrippawhatoh of course you wouldnt know chocolate frogs have cards inside them you know to collect famous witches and wizards ive got about five hundred but i havent got agrippa or ptolemyharry unwrapped his chocolate frog and picked up the card it showed a mans face he wore half moon glasses had a long crooked nose and flowing silver hair beard and mustache underneath the picture was the name albus dumbledoreso this is dumbledore said harrydont tell me youd never heard of dumbledore said ron can i have a frog i might get agrippa thanks harry turned over his card and read albus dumbledore currently headmaster of hogwarts considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard grindelwald in for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragons blood and his work on alchemy with his partner nicolas flamel professor dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowlingharry turned the card back over and saw to his astonishment that dumbledores face had disappearedhes gonewell you cant expect him to hang around all day said ron hell be back no ive got morgana again and ive got about six of her do you want it you can start collectingrons eyes strayed to the pile of chocolate frogs waiting to be unwrappedhelp yourself said harry but in you know the muggle world people just stay put in photosdo they what they dont move at all ron sounded amazed weirdharry stared as dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the famous witches and wizards cards but harry couldnt keep his eyes off them soon he had not only dumbledore and morgana but hengist of woodcroft alberic grunnion circe paracelsus and merlinhe finally tore his eyes away from the druidess cliodna who was scratching her nose to open a bag of bertie botts every flavor beansyou want to be careful with those ron warned harry when they say every flavor they mean every flavor you know you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and mar malade but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe george reckons he had a boogerflavored one onceron picked up a green bean looked at it carefully and bit into a cornerbleaaargh see sproutsthey had a good time eating the every flavor beans harry got toast coconut baked bean strawberry curry grass coffee sardine and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one ron wouldnt touch which turned out to be pepperthe countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder the neat fields had gone now there were woods twisting rivers and dark green hillsthere was a knock on the door of their compartment and the roundfaced boy harry had passed on platform nine and threequarters came in he looked tearfulsorry he said but have you seen a toad at allwhen they shook their heads he wailed ive lost him he keeps getting away from mehell turn up said harryyes said the boy miserably well if you see himhe leftdont know why hes so bothered said ron if id brought a toad id lose it as quick as i could mind you i brought scabbers so i cant talkthe rat was still snoozing on rons laphe might have died and you wouldnt know the difference said ron in disgust i tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting but the spell didnt work ill show you lookhe rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very batteredlooking wand it was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the endunicorn hairs nearly poking out anyway he had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open againthe toadless boy was back but this time he had a girl with him she was already wearing her new hogwarts robeshas anyone seen a toad nevilles lost one she said she had a bossy sort of voice lots of bushy brown hair and rather large front teethweve already told him we havent seen it said ron but the girl wasnt listening she was looking at the wand in his handoh are you doing magic lets see it thenshe sat down ron looked taken abacker all righthe cleared his throatsunshine daisies butter mellow turn this stupid fat rat yellowhe waved his wand but nothing happened scabbers stayed gray and fast asleepare you sure thats a real spell said the girl well its not very good is it ive tried a few simple spells just for practice and its all worked for me nobody in my familys magic at all it was ever such a surprise when i got my letter but i was ever so pleased of course i mean its the very best school of witchcraft there is ive heard ive learned all our course books by heart of course i just hope it will be enough im hermione granger by the way who are youshe said all this very fastharry looked at ron and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadnt learned all the course books by heart eitherim ron weasley ron mutteredharry potter said harryare you really said hermione i know all about you of course i got a few extra books for background reading and youre in modern magical history and the rise and fall of the dark arts and great wizarding events of the twentieth centuryam i said harry feeling dazedgoodness didnt you know id have found out everything i could if it was me said hermione do either of you know what house youll be in ive been asking around and i hope im in gryffindor it sounds by far the best i hear dumbledore himself was in it but i suppose ravenclaw wouldnt be too bad anyway wed better go and look for nevilles toad you two had better change you know i expect well be there soonand she left taking the toadless boy with herwhatever house im in i hope shes not in it said ron he threw his wand back into his trunk stupid spell george gave it to me bet he knew it was a dudwhat house are your brothers in asked harrygryffindor said ron gloom seemed to be settling on him again mom and dad were in it too i dont know what theyll say if im not i dont suppose ravenclaw would be too bad but imagine if they put me in slytherinthats the house vol i mean youknowwho was inyeah said ron he flopped back into his seat looking depressedyou know i think the ends of scabbers whiskers are a bit lightersaid harry trying to take rons mind off houses so what do your oldest brothers do now that theyve left anywayharry was wondering what a wizard did once hed finished schoolcharlies in romania studying dragons and bills in africa doing something for gringotts said ron did you hear about gringotts its been all over the daily prophet but i dont suppose you get that with the muggles someone tried to rob a high security vaultharry staredreally what happened to themnothing thats why its such big news they havent been caught my dad says it mustve been a powerful dark wizard to get round gringotts but they dont think they took anything thats whats odd course everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case youknowwhos behind itharry turned this news over in his mind he was starting to get a prickle of fear every time you knowwho was mentioned he supposed this was all part of entering the magical world but it had been a lot more comfortable saying voldemort without worryingwhats your quidditch team ron askeder i dont know any harry confessedwhat ron looked dumbfounded oh you wait its the best game in the world and he was off explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players describing famous games hed been to with his brothers and the broomstick hed like to get if he had the money he was just taking harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again but it wasnt neville the toadless boy or hermione granger this timethree boys entered and harry recognized the middle one at once it was the pale boy from madam malkins robe shop he was looking at harry with a lot more interest than hed shown back in diagon alleyis it true he said theyre saying all down the train that harry potters in this compartment so its you is ityes said harry he was looking at the other boys both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean standing on either side of the pale boy they looked like bodyguardsoh this is crabbe and this is goyle said the pale boy carelessly noticing where harry was looking and my names malfoy draco malfoyron gave a slight cough which might have been hiding a snigget draco malfoy looked at himthink my names funny do you no need to ask who you are my father told me all the weasleys have red hair freckles and more children than they can affordhe turned back to harry youll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others potter you dont want to go making friends with the wrong sort i can help you therehe held out his hand to shake harrys but harry didnt take iti think i can tell who the wrong sort are for myself thanks he said coollydraco malfoy didnt go red but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeksid be careful if i were you potter he said slowly unless youre a bit politer youll go the same way as your parents they didnt know what was good for them either you hang around with riffraff like the weasleys and that hagrid and itll rub off on youboth harry and ron stood upsay that again ron said his face as red as his hairoh youre going to fight us are you malfoy sneeredunless you get out now said harry more bravely than he felt because crabbe and goyle were a lot bigger than him or ronbut we dont feet like leaving do we boys weve eaten all our food and you still seem to have somegoyle reached toward the chocolate frogs next to ron ron leapt forward but before hed so much as touched goyle goyle let out a horrible yellscabbers the rat was hanging off his finger sharp little teeth sunk deep into goyles knuckle crabbe and malfoy backed away as goyle swung scabbers round and round howling and when scabbets finally flew off and hit the window all three of them disappeared at once perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets or perhaps theyd heard footsteps because a second later hermione granger had come inwhat has been going on she said looking at the sweets all over the floor and ron picking up scabbers by his taili think hes been knocked out ron said to harry he looked closer at scabbers no i dont believe it hes gone back to sleepand so he hadyouve met malfoy beforeharry explained about their meeting in diagon alleyive heard of his family said ron darkly they were some of the first to come back to our side after youknowwho disappeared said theyd been bewitched my dad doesnt believe it he says malfoys father didnt need an excuse to go over to the dark side he turned to hermione can we help you with somethingyoud better hurry up and put your robes on ive just been up to the front to ask the conductor and he says were nearly there you havent been fighting have you youll be in trouble before we even get therescabbers has been fighting not us said ron scowling at her would you mind leaving while we changeall right i only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly racing up and down the corridors said hermione in a sniffy voice and youve got dirt on your nose by the way did you knowron glared at her as she left harry peered out of the window it was getting dark he could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky the train did seem to be slowing downhe and ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robesrons were a bit short for him you could see his sneakers underneath thema voice echoed through the train we will be reaching hogwarts in five minutes time please leave your luggage on the train it will be taken to the school separatelyharrys stomach lurched with nerves and ron he saw looked pale under his freckles they crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridorthe train slowed right down and finally stopped people pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny dark platform harry shivered in the cold night air then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students and harry heard a familiar voice firs years firs years over here all right there harryhagrids big hairy face beamed over the sea of headscmon follow me any more firs years mind yer step now firs years follow meslipping and stumbling they followed hagrid down what seemed to be a steep narrow path it was so dark on either side of them that harry thought there must be thick trees there nobody spoke much neville the boy who kept losing his toad sniffed once or twiceye all get yer firs sight o hogwarts in a sec hagrid called over his shoulder jus round this bend herethere was a loud ooooohthe narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black takeperched atop a high mountain on the other side its windows sparkling in the starry sky was a vast castle with many turrets and towersno moren four to a boat hagrid called pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore harry and ron were followed into their boat by neville and hermione everyone in shouted hagrid who had a boat to himself right then forwardand the fleet of little boats moved off all at once gliding across the lake which was as smooth as glass everyone was silent staring up at the great castle overhead it towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stoodheads down yelled hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face they were carried along a dark tunnel which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle until they reached a kind of underground harbor where they clambered out onto rocks and pebblesoy you there is this your toad said hagrid who was checking the boats as people climbed out of themtrevor cried neville blissfully holding out his hands then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after hagrids lamp coming out at last onto smooth damp grass right in the shadow of the castlethey walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge oak front dooreveryone here you there still got yer toadhagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle doorchapter seventhe sorting hatthe door swung open at once a tall blackhaired witch in emeraldgreen robes stood there she had a very stern face and harrys first thought was that this was not someone to crossthe firs years professor mcgonagall said hagridthank you hagrid i will take them from hereshe pulled the door wide the entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the dursleys house in it the stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at gringotts the ceiling was too high to make out and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floorsthey followed professor mcgonagall across the flagged stone floor harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right the rest of the school must already be here but professor mcgonagall showed the first years into a small empty chamber off the hall they crowded in standing rather closer together than they would usually have done peering about nervouslywelcome to hogwarts said professor mcgonagall the startofterm banquet will begin shortly but before you take your seats in the great hall you will be sorted into your houses the sorting is a very important ceremony because while you are here your house will be something like your family within hogwarts you will have classes with the rest of your house sleep in your house dormitory and spend free time in your house common roomthe four houses are called gryffindor hufflepuff ravenclaw and slytherin each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards while you are at hogwarts your triumphs will earn your house points while any rulebreaking will lose house points at the end of the year the house with the most points is awarded the house cup a great honor i hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yoursthe sorting ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school i suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waitingher eyes lingered for a moment on nevilles cloak which was fastened under his left ear and on rons smudged nose harry nervously tried to flatten his hairi shall return when we are ready for you said professor mcgonagallplease wait quietlyshe left the chamber harry swallowedhow exactly do they sort us into houses he asked ronsome sort of test i think fred said it hurts a lot but i think he was jokingharrys heart gave a horrible jolt a test in front of the whole school but he didnt know any magic yet what on earth would he have to do he hadnt expected something like this the moment they arrivedhe looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified too no one was talking much except hermione granger who was whispering very fast about all the spells shed learned and wondering which one shed need harry tried hard not to listen to her hed never been more nervous never not even when hed had to take a school report home to the dursleys saying that hed somehow turned his teachers wig blue he kept his eyes fixed on the door any second now professor mcgonagall would come back and lead him to his doomthen something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air several people behind him screamedwhat the he gasped so did the people around him about twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall pearlywhite and slightly transparent they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years they seemed to be arguing what looked like a fat little monk was saying forgive and forget i say we ought to give him a second chance my dear friar havent we given peeves all the chances he deserves he gives us all a bad name and you know hes not really even a ghost i say what are you all doing herea ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first yearsnobody answerednew students said the fat friar smiling around at them about to be sorted i supposea few people nodded mutelyhope to see you in hufflepuff said the friar my old house you knowmove along now said a sharp voice the sorting ceremonys about to startprofessor mcgonagall had returned one by one the ghosts floated away through the opposite wallnow form a line professor mcgonagall told the first years and follow mefeeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair with ron behind him and they walked out of the chamber back across the hall and through a pair of double doors into the great hallharry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place it was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables where the rest of the students were sittingthese tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets at the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sittingprofessor mcgonagall led the first years up here so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students with the teachers behind themthe hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight dotted here and there among the students the ghosts shone misty silver mainly to avoid all the staring eyes harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars he heard hermione whisper its bewitched to look like the sky outside i read about it in hogwarts a historyit was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all and that the great hall didnt simply open on to the heavensharry quickly looked down again as professor mcgonagall silently placed a fourlegged stool in front of the first years on top of the stool she put a pointed wizards hat this hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty aunt petunia wouldnt have let it in the housemaybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it harry thought wildly that seemed the sort of thing noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat he stared at it too for a few seconds there was complete silence then the hat twitched a rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth and the hat began to sing oh you may not think im pretty but dont judge on what you see ill eat myself if you can find a smarter hat than meyou can keep your bowlers black your top hats sleek and tall for im the hogwarts sorting hat and i can cap them alltheres nothing hidden in your head the sorting hat cant see so try me on and i will tell you where you ought to beyou might belong in gryffindor where dwell the brave at heart their daring nerve and chivalry set gryffindors apart you might belong in hufflepuff where they are just and loyal those patient hufflepuffis are true and unafraid of toil or yet in wise old ravenclaw if youve a ready mind where those of wit and learning will always find their kind or perhaps in slytherin youll make your real friends those cunning folk use any means to achieve their endsso put me on dont be afraid and dont get in a flap youre in safe hands though i have none for im a thinking capthe whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song it bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still againso weve just got to try on the hat ron whispered to harry ill kill fred he was going on about wrestling a trollharry smiled weakly yes trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching the hat seemed to be asking rather alot harry didnt feel brave or quickwitted or any of it at the moment if only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy that would have been the one for himprofessor mcgonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchmentwhen i call your name you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted she said abbott hannaha pinkfaced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line put on the hat which fell right down over her eyes and sat down a moments pause hufflepuff shouted the hatthe table on the right cheered and clapped as hannah went to sit down at the hufflepuff table harry saw the ghost of the fat friar waving merrily at herbones susanhufflepuff shouted the hat again and susan scuttled off to sit next to hannahboot terryravenclawthe table second from the left clapped this time several ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with terry as he joined thembrocklehurst mandy went to ravenclaw too but brown lavenderbecame the first new gryffindor and the table on the far left exploded with cheers harry could see rons twin brothers catcallingbulstrode millicent then became a slytherin perhaps it was harrys imagination after all hed heard about slytherin but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot he was starting to feel definitely sick now he remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old schoolhe had always been last to be chosen not because he was no good but because no one wanted dudley to think they liked himfinchfletchley justinhufflepuffsometimes harry noticed the hat shouted out the house at once but at others it took a little while to decide finnigan seamus the sandyhaired boy next to harry in the line sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a gryffindorgranger hermionehermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her headgryffindor shouted the hat ron groaneda horrible thought struck harry as horrible thoughts always do when youre very nervous what if he wasnt chosen at all what if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages until professor mcgonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and hed better get back on the train when neville longbottom the boy who kept losing his toad was called he fell over on his way to the stool the hat took a long time to decide with neville when it finally shouted gryffindor neville ran off still wearing it and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to macdougal moragmalfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed slytherinmalfoy went to join his friends crabbe and goyle looking pleased with himselfthere werent many people left now moon nott parkinson then a pair of twin girls patil and patil then perks sallyanne and then at last potter harryas harry stepped forward whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hallpotter did she saythe harry potterthe last thing harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat he waitedhmm said a small voice in his ear difficult very difficult plenty of courage i see not a bad mind either theres talent a my goodness yes and a nice thirst to prove yourself now thats interestingso where shall i put youharry gripped the edges of the stool and thought not slytherin not slytherinnot slytherin eh said the small voice are you sure you could be great you know its all here in your head and slytherin will help you on the way to greatness no doubt about that no well if youre sure better be gryffindorharry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall he took off the hat and walked shakily toward the gryffindor table he was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in slytherin he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet percy the prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously while the weasley twins yelled we got potter we got potter harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff hed seen earlier the ghost patted his arm giving harry the sudden horrible feeling hed just plunged it into a bucket of icecold waterhe could see the high table properly now at the end nearest him sat hagrid who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up harry grinned back and there in the center of the high table in a large gold chair sat albus dumbledore harry recognized him at once from the card hed gotten out of the chocolate frog on the train dumbledores silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts harry spotted professor quirtell too the nervous young man from the leaky cauldron he was looking very peculiar in a large purple turbanand now there were only three people left to be sorted thomas deana black boy even taller than ron joined harry at the gryffindor tableturpin lisa became a ravenclaw and then it was rons turn he was pale green by now harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted gryffindorharry clapped loudly with the rest as ron collapsed into the chair next to himwell done ron excellent said percy weasley pompously across harry as zabini blaise was made a slytherin professor mcgonagall rolled up her scroll and took the sorting hat awayharry looked down at his empty gold plate he had only just realized how hungry he was the pumpkin pasties seemed ages agoalbus dumbledore had gotten to his feet he was beaming at the students his arms opened wide as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all therewelcome he said welcome to a new year at hogwarts before we begin our banquet i would like to say a few words and here they are nitwit blubber oddment tweak thank youhe sat back down everybody clapped and cheered harry didnt know whether to laugh or notis he a bit mad he asked percy uncertainlymad said percy airily hes a genius best wizard in the world but he is a bit mad yes potatoes harryharrys mouth fell open the dishes in front of him were now piled with food he had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table roast beef roast chicken pork chops and lamb chops sausages bacon and steak boiled potatoes roast potatoes fries yorkshire pudding peas carrots gravy ketchup and for some strange reason peppermint humbugsthe dursleys had never exactly starved harry but hed never been allowed to eat as much as he liked dudley had always taken anything that harry really wanted even if it made him sick harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eatit was all deliciousthat does look good said the ghost in the ruff sadly watching harry cut up his steak cant you i havent eaten for nearly four hundred years said the ghost i dont need to of course but one does miss it i dont think ive in troduced myself sir nicholas de mimsyporpington at your service resident ghost of gryffindor toweri know who you are said ron suddenly my brothers told me about you youre nearly headless nicki would prefer you to call me sir nicholas de mimsy the ghost began stiffly but sandyhaired seamus finnigan interruptednearly headless how can you be nearly headlesssir nicholas looked extremely miffed as if their little chat wasnt going at all the way he wantedlike this he said irritably he seized his left ear and pulled his whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge someone had obviously tried to behead him but not done it properly looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces nearly headless nick flipped his head back onto his neck coughed and said so new gryffindors i hope youre going to help us win the house championship this year gryffindors have never gone so long without winning slytherins have got the cup six years in a row the bloody barons becoming almost unbearable hes the slytherin ghostharry looked over at the slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there with blank staring eyes a gaunt face and robes stained with silver blood he was right next to malfoy who harry was pleased to see didnt look too pleased with the seating arrangementshow did he get covered in blood asked seamus with great interestive never asked said nearly headless nick delicatelywhen everyone had eaten as much as they could the remains of the food faded from the plates leaving them sparkling clean as before a moment later the desserts appeared blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of apple pies treacle tarts chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts trifle strawberries jello rice pudding Ã¢â‚¬Å“as harry helped himself to a treacle tart the talk turned to their familiesim halfandhalf said seamus me dads a muggle mom didnt tell him she was a witch til after they were married bit of a nasty shock for himthe others laughedwhat about you neville said ronwell my gran brought me up and shes a witch said neville but the family thought i was all muggle for ages my great uncle algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me he pushed me off the end of blackpool pier once i nearly drowned but nothing happened until i was eight great uncle algie came round for dinner and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my great auntie enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go but i bounced all the way down the garden and into the road they were all really pleased gran was crying she was so happy and you should have seen their faces when i got in here they thought i might not be magic enough to come you see great uncle algie was so pleased he bought me my toadon harrys other side percy weasley and hermione were talking about lessons i do hope they start right away theres so much to learn im particularly interested in transfiguration you know turning something into something else of course its supposed to be very difficult youll be starting small just matches into needles and that sort of thing harry who was starting to feel warm and sleepy looked up at the high table again hagrid was drinking deeply from his gobletprofessor mcgonagall was talking to professor dumbledore professor quirrell in his absurd turban was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair a hooked nose and sallow skinit happened very suddenly the hooknosed teacher looked past quirrells turban straight into harrys eyes and a sharp hot pain shot across the scar on harrys foreheadouch harry clapped a hand to his headwhat is it asked percynnothingthe pain had gone as quickly as it had come harder to shake off was the feeling harry had gotten from the teachers look a feeling that he didnt like harry at allwhos that teacher talking to professor quirrell he asked percyoh you know quirrell already do you no wonder hes looking so nervous thats professor snape he teaches potions but he doesnt want to everyone knows hes after quirrells job knows an awful lot about the dark arts snapeharry watched snape for a while but snape didnt look at him againat last the desserts too disappeared and professor dumbledore got to his feet again the hall fell silentahern just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered i have a few startofterm notices to give youfirst years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils and a few of our older students would do well to remember that as welldumbledores twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the weasley twinsi have also been asked by mr filch the caretaker to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridorsquidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact madam hoochand finally i must tell you that this year the thirdfloor corridor on the righthand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful deathharry laughed but he was one of the few who didhes not serious he muttered to percymust be said percy frowning at dumbledore its odd because he usually gives us a reason why were not allowed to go somewhere the forests full of dangerous beasts everyone knows that i do think he might have told us prefects at leastand now before we go to bed let us sing the school song cried dumbledore harry noticed that the other teachers smiles had become rather fixeddumbledore gave his wand a little flick as if he was trying to get a fly off the end and a long golden ribbon flew out of it which rose high above the tables and twisted itself snakelike into wordseveryone pick their favorite tune said dumbledore and off we goand the school bellowed hogwarts hogwarts hoggy warty hogwarts teach us something please whether we be old and bald or young with scabby knees our heads could do with filling with some interesting stuff for now theyre bare and full of air dead flies and bits of fluff so teach us things worth knowing bring back what weve forgot just do your best well do the rest and learn until our brains all roteverybody finished the song at different times at last only the weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral marchdumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished he was one of those who clapped loudestah music he said wiping his eyes a magic beyond all we do here and now bedtime off you trotthe gryffindor first years followed percy through the chattering crowds out of the great hall and up the marble staircase harrys legs were like lead again but only because he was so tired and full of food he was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed or that twice percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries they climbed more staircases yawning and dragging their feet and harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halta bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them and as percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at himpeeves percy whispered to the first years a poltergeist he raised his voice peeves show yourselfa loud rude sound like the air being let out of a balloon answereddo you want me to go to the bloody baronthere was a pop and a little man with wicked dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared floating cross legged in the air clutching the walking sticksoooooooh he said with an evil cackle ickle firsties what funhe swooped suddenly at them they all duckedgo away peeves or the baronll hear about this i mean it barked percypeeves stuck out his tongue and vanished dropping the walking sticks on nevilles head they heard him zooming away rattling coats of armor as he passedyou want to watch out for peeves said percy as they set off againthe bloody barons the only one who can control him he wont even listen to us prefects here we areat the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dresspassword she said caput draconis said percy and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall they all scrambled through it neville needed a leg up and found themselves in the gryffindor common room a cozy round room full of squashy armchairspercy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another at the top of a spiral staircase they were obviously in one of the towers they found their beds at last five fourposters hung with deep red velvet curtains their trunks had already been brought up too tired to talk much they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bedgreat food isnt it ron muttered to harry through the hangingsget off scabbers hes chewing my sheetsharry was going to ask ron if hed had any of the treacle tart but he fell asleep almost at onceperhaps harry had eaten a bit too much because he had a very strange dream he was wearing professor quirrells turban which kept talking to him telling him he must transfer to slytherin at once because it was his destiny harry told the turban he didnt want to be in slytherin it got heavier and heavier he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully and there was malfoy laughing at him as he struggled with it then malfoy turned into the hooknosed teacher snape whose laugh became high and cold there was a burst of green light and harry woke sweating and shakinghe rolled over and fell asleep again and when he woke next day he didnt remember the dream at allchapter eightthe potions masterthere lookwherenext to the tall kid with the red hairwearing the glassesdid you see his facedid you see his scarwhispers followed harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day people lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again staringharry wished they wouldnt because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classesthere were a hundred and fortytwo staircases at hogwarts wide sweeping ones narrow rickety ones some that led somewhere different on a friday some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump then there were doors that wouldnt open unless you asked politely or tickled them in exactly the right place and doors that werent really doors at all but solid walls just pretending it was also very hard to remember where anything was because it all seemed to move around a lot the people in the portraits kept going to visit each other and harry was sure the coats of armor could walkthe ghosts didnt help either it was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open nearly headless nick was always happy to point new gryffindors in the right direction but peeves the poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class he would drop wastepaper baskets on your head pull rugs from under your feet pelt you with bits of chalk or sneak up behind you invisible grab your nose and screech got your conkeven worse than peeves if that was possible was the caretaker argus filch harry and ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the outofbounds corridor on the third floor he wouldnt believe they were lost was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by professor quirrell who was passingfilch owned a cat called mrs norris a scrawny dustcolored creature with bulging lamp like eyes just like filchs she patrolled the corridors alone break a rule in front of her put just one toe out of line and shed whisk off for filch whod appear wheezing two seconds later filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone except perhaps the weasley twins and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts the students all hated him and it was the dearest ambition of many to give mrs norris a good kickand then once you had managed to find them there were the classes themselves there was a lot more to magic as harry quickly found out than waving your wand and saying a few funny wordsthey had to study the night skies through their telescopes every wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study herbology with a dumpy little witch called professor sprout where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi and found out what they were used foreasily the most boring class was history of magic which was the only one taught by a ghost professor binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach leaving his body behind him binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates and got emetic the evil and uric the oddball mixed upprofessor flitwick the charms teacher was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk at the start of their first class he took the roll call and when he reached harrys name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sightprofessor mcgonagall was again different harry had been quite right to think she wasnt a teacher to cross strict and clever she gave them a talkingto the moment they sat down in her first classtransfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at hogwarts she said anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back you have been warnedthen she changed her desk into a pig and back again they were all very impressed and couldnt wait to get started but soon realized they werent going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long timeafter taking a lot of complicated notes they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle by the end of the lesson only hermione granger had made any difference to her match professor mcgonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave hermione a rare smilethe class everyone had really been looking forward to was defense against the dark arts but quirrells lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke his classroom smelled strongly of garlic which everyone said was to ward off a vampire hed met in romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days his turban he told them had been given to him by an african prince as a thankyou for getting rid of a troublesome zombie but they werent sure they believed this storyfor one thing when seamus finnigan asked eagerly to hear how quirrell had fought off the zombie quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather for another they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban and the weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well so that quirrell was protected wherever he wentharry was very relieved to find out that he wasnt miles behind everyone else lots of people had come from muggle families and like him hadnt had any idea that they were witches and wizards there was so much to learn that even people like ron didnt have much of a head startfriday was an important day for harry and ron they finally managed to find their way down to the great hall for breakfast without getting lost oncewhat have we got today harry asked ron as he poured sugar on his porridgedouble potions with the slytherins said ron snapes head of slytherin house they say he always favors them well be able to see if its truewish mcgonagall favored us said harry professor mcgonagall was head of gryffindor house but it hadnt stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day beforejust then the mail arrived harry had gotten used to this by now but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the great hall during breakfast circling the tables until they saw their owners and dropping letters and packages onto their lapshedwig hadnt brought harry anything so far she sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls this morning however she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto harrys plate harry tore it open at once it said in a very untidy scrawl dear harry i know you get friday afternoons off so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three i want to hear all about your first week send us an answer back with hedwighagrid harry borrowed rons quill scribbled yes please see you later on the back of the note and sent hedwig off againit was lucky that harry had tea with hagrid to look forward to because the potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so farat the startofterm banquet harry had gotten the idea that professor snape disliked him by the end of the first potions lesson he knew hed been wrong snape didnt dislike harry he hated himpotions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons it was colder here than up in the main castle and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the wallssnape like flitwick started the class by taking the roll call and like flitwick he paused at harrys nameah yes he said softly harry potter our new celebritydraco malfoy and his friends crabbe and goyle sniggered behind their hands snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class his eyes were black like hagrids but they had none of hagrids warmththey were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnelsyou are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking he began he spoke in barely more than a whisper but they caught every word like professor mcgonagall snape had y caught every word like professor mcgonagall snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort as there is little foolish wandwaving here many of you will hardly believe this is magic i dont expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins bewitching the mind ensnaring the senses i can teach you how to bottle fame brew glory even stopper death if you arent as big a bunch of dunderheads as i usually have to teachmore silence followed this little speech harry and ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows hermione granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasnt a dunderheadpotter said snape suddenly what would i get if i added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwoodpowdered root of what to an infusion of what harry glanced at ron who looked as stumped as he was hermiones hand had shot into the airi dont know sit said harrysnapes lips curled into a sneertut tut fame clearly isnt everythinghe ignored hermiones handlets try again potter where would you look if i told you to find me a bezoarhermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat but harry didnt have the faintest idea what a bezoar was he tried not to look at malfoy crabbe and goyle who were shaking with laughteri dont know sit thought you wouldnt open a book before coming eh potter harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes he had looked through his books at the dursleys but did snape expect him to remember everything in one thousand magical herbs and fungi snape was still ignoring hermiones quivering handwhat is the difference potter between monkshood and wolfsbaneat this hermione stood up her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceilingi dont know said harry quietly i think hermione does though why dont you try hera few people laughed harry caught seamuss eye and seamus winkedsnape however was not pleasedsit down he snapped at hermione for your information potter asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the draught of living death a bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons as for monkshood and wolfsbane they are the same plant which also goes by the name of aconite well why arent you all copying that downthere was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment over the noise snape said and a point will be taken from gryffindor house for your cheek potterthings didnt improve for the gryffindors as the potions lesson continued snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils he swept around in his long black cloak watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs criticizing almost everyone except malfoy whom he seemed to like he was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon neville had somehow managed to melt seamuss cauldron into a twisted blob and their potion was seeping across the stone floor burning holes in peoples shoes within seconds the whole class was standing on their stools while neville who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legsidiot boy snarled snape clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand i suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fireneville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nosetake him up to the hospital wing snape spat at seamus then he rounded on harry and ron who had been working next to nevilleyou potter why didnt you tell him not to add the quills thought hed make you look good if he got it wrong did you thats another point youve lost for gryffindorthis was so unfair that harry opened his mouth to argue but ron kicked him behind their cauldrondoi push it he muttered ive heard snape can turn very nastyas they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later harrys mind was racing and his spirits were low hed lost two points for gryffindor in his very first week why did snape hate him so much cheer upsaid ron snapes always taking points off fred and george can i come and meet hagrid with youat five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest a crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front doorwhen harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks then hagrids voice rang out saying back fang backhagrids big hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door openhang on he said back fanghe let them in struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhoundthere was only one room inside hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over itmake yerselves at home said hagrid letting go of fang who bounded straight at ron and started licking his ears like hagrid fang was clearly not as fierce as he lookedthis is ron harry told hagrid who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plateanother weasley eh said hagrid glancing at rons freckles i spent half me life chasin yer twin brothers away from the forestthe rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth but harry and ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told hagrid all about their first lessons fang rested his head on harrys knee and drooled all over his robesharry and ron were delighted to hear hagrid call fitch that old gitan as fer that cat mrs norris id like ter introduce her to fang sometime dyeh know every time i go up ter the school she follows me everywhere cant get rid of her fitch puts her up to itharry told hagrid about snapes lesson hagrid like ron told harry not to worry about it that snape liked hardly any of the studentsbut he seemed to really hate merubbish said hagrid why should heyet harry couldnt help thinking that hagrid didnt quite meet his eyes when he said thathows yer brother charlie hagrid asked ron i liked him a lot great with animalsharry wondered if hagrid had changed the subject on purpose while ron told hagrid all about charlies work with dragons harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy it was a cutting from the daily prophet gringotts breakin latest investigations continue into the breakin at gringotts on july widely believed to be the work of dark wizards or witches unknowngringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken the vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same daybut were not telling you what was in there so keep your noses out if you know whats good for you said a gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoonharry remembered ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob gringotts but ron hadnt mentioned the datehagrid said harry that gringotts breakin happened on my birthday it mightve been happening while we were therethere was no doubt about it hagrid definitely didnt meet harrys eyes this time he grunted and offered him another rock cake harry read the story again the vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen if you could call it emptying taking out that grubby little package had that been what the thieves were looking for as harry and ron walked back to the castle for dinner their pockets weighed down with rock cakes theyd been too polite to refuse harry thought that none of the lessons hed had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with hagrid had hagrid collected that package just in time where was it now and did hagrid know something about snape that he didnt want to tell harry chapter ninethe midnight duelharry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than dudley but that was before he met draco malfoy still firstyear gryffindors only had potions with the slytherins so they didnt have to put up with malfoy much or at least they didnt until they spotted a notice pinned up in the gryffindor common room that made them all groanflying lessons would be starting on thursday and gryffindor and slytherin would be learning togethertypical said harry darkly just what i always wanted to make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of malfoyhe had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything elseyou dont know that youll make a fool of yourself said ron reasonably anyway i know malfoys always going on about how good he is at quidditch but i bet thats all talkmalfay certainly did talk about flying a lot he complained loudly about first years never getting on the house quidditch teams and told long boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping muggles in helicopters he wasnt the only one though the way seamus finnigan told it hed spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick even ron would tell anyone whod listen about the time hed almost hit a hang glider on charlies old broomeveryone from wizarding families talked about quidditch constantly ron had already had a big argument with dean thomas who shared their dormitory about soccer ron couldnt see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly harry had caught ron prodding deans poster of west ham soccer team trying to make the players moveneville had never been on a broomstick in his life because his grandmother had never let him near one privately harry felt shed had good reason because neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the groundhermione granger was almost as nervous about flying as neville was this was something you couldnt learn by heart out of a book not that she hadnt tried at breakfast on thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips shed gotten out of a library book called quidditch through the ages neville was hanging on to her every word desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later but everybody else was very pleased when hermiones lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mailharry hadnt had a single letter since hagrids note something that malfoy had been quick to notice of course malfoys eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home which he opened gloatingly at the slytherin tablea barn owl brought neville a small package from his grandmother he opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble which seemed to be full of white smokeits a remembrall he explained gran knows i forget things this tells you if theres something youve forgotten to do look you hold it tight like this and if it turns red oh his face fell because the remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet youve forgotten somethingneville was trying to remember what hed forgotten when draco malfoy who was passing the gryffindor table snatched the remembrall out of his handharry and ron jumped to their feet they were half hoping for a reason to fight malfay but professor mcgonagall who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school was there in a flashwhats going onmalfoys got my remembrall professorscowling malfoy quickly dropped the remembrall back on the tablejust looking he said and he sloped away with crabbe and goyle behind himat threethirty that afternoon harry ron and the other gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson it was a clear breezy day and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest whose trees were swaying darkly in the distancethe slytherins were already there and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground harry had heard fred and george weasley complain about the school brooms saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high or always flew slightly to the lefttheir teacher madam hooch arrived she had short gray hair and yellow eyes like a hawkwell what are you all waiting for she barked everyone stand by a broomstick come on hurry upharry glanced down at his broom it was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd anglesstick out your right hand over your broom called madam hooch at the front and say up upf everyone shoutedharrys broom jumped into his hand at once but it was one of the few that did hermione grangers had simply rolled over on the ground and nevilles hadnt moved at all perhaps brooms like horses could tell when you were afraid thought harry there was a quaver in nevilles voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the groundmadam hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end and walked up and down the rows correcting their gripsharry and ron were delighted when she told malfoy hed been doing it wrong for yearsnow when i blow my whistle you kick off from the ground hard said madam hooch keep your brooms steady rise a few feet and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly on my whistle three two but neville nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground pushed off hard before the whistle had touched madam hoochs lipscome back boy she shouted but neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle twelve feet twenty feet harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away saw him gasp slip sideways off the broom and wham a thud and a nasty crack and neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap his broomstick was still rising higher and higher and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sightmadam hooch was bending over neville her face as white as hisbroken wrist harry heard her mutter come on boy its all right up you getshe turned to the rest of the classnone of you is to move while i take this boy to the hospital wing you leave those brooms where they are or youll be out of hogwarts before you can say quidditch come on dearneville his face tearstreaked clutching his wrist hobbled off with madam hooch who had her arm around himno sooner were they out of earshot than malfoy burst into laughterdid you see his face the great lumpthe other slytherins joined inshut up malfoy snapped parvati patilooh sticking up for longbottom said pansy parkinson a hardfaced slytherin girl never thought youd like fat little crybabies parvatilook said malfoy darting forward and snatching something out of the grass its that stupid thing longbottoms gran sent himthe remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it upgive that here malfoy said harry quietly everyone stopped talking to watchmalfoy smiled nastilyi think ill leave it somewhere for longbottom to find how about up a treegive it here harry yelled but malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off he hadnt been lying he could fly well hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called come and get it potterharry grabbed his broomno shouted hermione granger madam hooch told us not to move youll get us all into troubleharry ignored her blood was pounding in his ears he mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up up he soared air rushed through his hair and his robes whipped out behind him and in a rush of fierce joy he realized hed found something he could do without being taught this was easy this was wonderful he pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from ronhe turned his broomstick sharply to face malfoy in midair malfoy looked stunnedgive it here harry called or ill knock you off that broom oh yeah said malfoy trying to sneer but looking worriedharry knew somehow what to do he leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands and it shot toward malfay like a javelin malfoy only just got out of the way in time harry made a sharp aboutface and held the broom steady a few people below were clappingno crabbe and goyle up here to save your neck malfoy harry calledthe same thought seemed to have struck malfoycatch it if you can then he shouted and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the groundharry saw as though in slow motion the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall he leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive racing the ball wind whistled in his ears mingled with the screams of people watching he stretched out his hand a foot from the ground he caught it just in time to pull his broom straight and he toppled gently onto the grass with the remembrall clutched safely in his fistharry potterhis heart sank faster than hed just dived professor mcgonagall was running toward them he got to his feet tremblingnever in all my time at hogwarts professor mcgonagall was almost speechless with shock and her glasses flashed furiously how dare you might have broken your neck it wasnt his fault professor be quiet miss patil but malfoy thats enough mr weasley potter follow me nowharry caught sight of malfoy crabbe and goyles triumphant faces as he left walking numbly in professor mcgonagalls wake as she strode toward the castle he was going to be expelled he just knew it he wanted to say something to defend himself but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice professor mcgonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him he had to jog to keep up now hed done it he hadnt even lasted two weeks hed be packing his bags in ten minutes what would the dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep up the front steps up the marble staircase inside and still professor mcgonagall didnt say a word to him she wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with harry trotting miserably behind her maybe she was taking him to dumbledore he thought of hagrid expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper perhaps he could be hagrids assistant his stomach twisted as he imagined it watching ron and the others becoming wizards while he stumped around the grounds carrying hagrids bagprofessor mcgonagall stopped outside a classroom she opened the door and poked her head insideexcuse me professor flitwick could i borrow wood for a momentwood thought harry bewildered was wood a cane she was going to use on him but wood turned out to be a person a burly fifthyear boy who came out of flitwicles class looking confusedfollow me you two said professor mcgonagall and they marched on up the corridor wood looking curiously at harryin hereprofessor mcgonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for peeves who was busy writing rude words on the blackboardout peeves she barked peeves threw the chalk into a bin which clanged loudly and he swooped out cursing professor mcgonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boyspotter this is oliver wood wood ive found you a seekerwoods expression changed from puzzlement to delightare you serious professorabsolutely said professor mcgonagall crisply the boys a naturalive never seen anything like it was that your first time on a broomstick potterharry nodded silently he didnt have a clue what was going on but he didnt seem to be being expelled and some of the feeling started coming back to his legshe caught that thing in his hand after a fiftyfoot dive professor mcgonagall told wood didnt even scratch himself charlie weasley couldnt have done itwood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at onceever seen a game of quidditch potter he asked excitedlywoods captain of the gryffindor team professor mcgonagall explainedhes just the build for a seeker too said wood now walking around harry and staring at him light speedy well have to

hard potter or i may change my mind about punishing youthen she suddenly smiledyour father would have been proud she said he was an excellent quidditch player himselfyoure jokingit was dinnertime harry had just finished telling ron what had happened when hed left the grounds with professor mcgonagall ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth but hed forgotten all about itseeker he said but first years never you must be the youngest house player in about a century said harry shoveling pie into his mouth he felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon wood told meron was so amazed so impressed he just sat and gaped at harryi start training next week said harry only dont tell anyone wood wants to keep it a secretfred and george weasley now came into the hall spotted harry and hurried overwell done said george in a low voice wood told us were on the team too beatersi tell you were going to win that quidditch cup for sure this yearsaid fred we havent won since charlie left but this years team is going to be brilliant you must be good harry wood was almost skipping when he told usanyway weve got to go lee jordan reckons hes found a new secret passageway out of the schoolbet its that one behind the statue of gregory the smarmy that we found in our first week see youfred and george had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up malfoy flanked by crabbe and goylehaving a last meal potter when are you getting the train back to the mugglesyoure a lot braver now that youre back on the ground and youve got your little friends with you said harry coolly there was of course nothing at all little about crabbe and goyle but as the high table was full of teachers neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowlid take you on anytime on my own said malfoy tonight if you wantwizards duel wands only no contact whats the matter never heard of a wizards duel before i supposeof course he has said ron wheeling around im his second whos yoursmalfoy looked at crabbe and goyle sizing them upcrabbe he said midnight all right well meet you in the trophy room thats always unlockedwhen malfoy had gone ron and harry looked at each other what is a wizards duel said harry and what do you mean youre my secondwell a seconds there to take over if you die said ron casually getting started at last on his cold pie catching the look on harrys face he added quickly but people only die in proper duels you know with real wizards the most you and malfoyll be able to do is send sparks at each other neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage i bet he expected you to refuse anywayand what if i wave my wand and nothing happensthrow it away and punch him on the nose ron suggested excuse methey both looked up it was hermione grangercant a person eat in peace in this place said ronhermione ignored him and spoke to harryi couldnt help overhearing what you and malfoy were saying bet you could ron mutteredand you mustnt go wandering around the school at night think of the points youll lose gryffindor if youre caught and youre bound to beits really very selfish of youand its really none of your business said harrygoodbye said ronall the same it wasnt what youd call the perfect end to the day harry thought as he lay awake much later listening to dean and seamus falling asleep neville wasnt back from the hospital wing ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as if he tries to curse you youd better dodge it because i cant remember how to block themthere was a very good chance they were going to get caught by filch or mrs norris and harry felt he was pushing his luck breaking another school rule today on the other hand malfoys sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness this was his big chance to beat malfoy facetoface he couldnt miss ithalfpast eleven ron muttered at last wed better gothey pulled on their bathrobes picked up their wands and crept across the tower room down the spiral staircase and into the gryffindor common room a few embers were still glowing in the fireplace turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows they had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them i cant believe youre going to do this harrya lamp flickered on it was hermione granger wearing a pink bathrobe and a frownyou said ron furiously go back to bedi almost told your brother hermione snapped percy hes a prefect hed put a stop to thisharry couldnt believe anyone could be so interferingcome on he said to ron he pushed open the portrait of the fat lady and climbed through the holehermione wasnt going to give up that easily she followed ron through the portrait hole hissing at them like an angry goosedont you care about gryffindor do you only care about yourselves i dont want slytherin to win the house cup and youll lose all the points i got from professor mcgonagall for knowing about switching spellsgo away all right but i warned you you just remember what i said when youre on the train home tomorrow youre so but what they were they didnt find out hermione had turned to the portrait of the fat lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting the fat lady had gone on a nighttime visit and hermione was locked out of gryffindor towernow what am i going to do she asked shrillythats your problem said ron weve got to go we re going to be latethey hadnt even reached the end of the corridor when hermione caught up with themim coming with you she saidyou are notdyou think im going to stand out here and wait for filch to catch me if he finds all three of us ill tell him the truth that i was trying to stop you and you can back me upyouve got some nerve said ron loudlyshut up both of you said harry sharply i heard somethingit was a sort of snufflingmrs norris breathed ron squinting through the darkit wasnt mrs norris it was neville he was curled up on the floor fast asleep but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearerthank goodness you found me ive been out here for hours i couldnt remember the new password to get in to bedkeep your voice down neville the passwords pig snout but it wont help you now the fat ladys gone off somewherehows your arm said harryfine said neville showing them madam pomfrey mended it in about a minutegood well look neville weve got to be somewhere well see you later dont leave me said neville scrambling to his feet i dont want to stay here alone the bloody barons been past twice alreadyron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at hermione and nevilleif either of you get us caught ill never rest until ive learned that curse of the bogies quirrell told us about and used it on youhermione opened her mouth perhaps to tell ron exactly how to use the curse of the bogies but harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forwardthey flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows at every turn harry expected to run into filch or mrs norris but they were lucky they sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy roommalfoy and crabbe werent there yet the crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them cups shields plates and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness they edged along the walls keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room harry took out his wand in case malfoy leapt in and started at once the minutes crept byhes late maybe hes chickened out ron whisperedthen a noise in the next room made them jump harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak and it wasnt malfoysniff around my sweet they might be lurking in a cornerit was filch speaking to mrs norris horrorstruck harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible they scurried silently toward the door away from filchs voice nevilles robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard filch enter the trophy roomtheyre in here somewhere they heard him mutter probably hidingthis way harry mouthed to the others and petrified they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor they could hear filch getting nearer neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run he tripped grabbed ron around the waist and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armorthe clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castlerun harry yelled and the four of them sprinted down the gallery not looking back to see whether filch was following they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another harry in the lead without any idea where they were or where they were going they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway hurtled along it and came out near their charms classroom which they knew was miles from the trophy roomi think weve lost him harry panted leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead neville was bent double wheezing and splutteringi told you hermione gasped clutching at the stitch in her chest i told youweve got to get back to gryffindor tower said ron quickly as possiblemalfoy tricked you hermione said to harry you realize that dont you he was never going to meet you filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room malfoy must have tipped him offharry thought she was probably right but he wasnt going to tell her thatlets goit wasnt going to be that simple they hadnt gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of themit was peeves he caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delightshut up peeves please youll get us thrown outpeeves cackledwandering around at midnight ickle firsties tut tut tut naughty naughty youll get caughtynot if you dont give us away peeves pleaseshould tell filch i should said peeves in a saintly voice but his eyes glittered wickedly its for your own good you knowget out of the way snapped ron taking a swipe at peeves this was a big mistakestudents out of bed peeves bellowed students out of bed down the charms corridorducking under peeves they ran for their lives right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door and it was lockedthis is it ron moaned as they pushed helplessly at the door were done for this is the end they could hear footsteps filch running as fast as he could toward peevess shoutsoh move over hermione snarled she grabbed harrys wand tapped the lock and whispered alohomorathe lock clicked and the door swung open they piled through it shut it quickly and pressed their ears against it listeningwhich way did they go peeves filch was saying quick tell mesay please dont mess with me peeves now where did they goshant say nothing if you dont say please said peeves in his annoying singsong voiceall right pleasenothing ha haaa told you i wouldnt say nothing if you didnt say please ha ha haaaaaa and they heard the sound of peeves whooshing away and filch cursing in ragehe thinks this door is locked harry whispered i think well be okay get off neville for neville had been tugging on the sleeve of harrys bathrobe for the last minute whatharry turned around and saw quite clearly what for a moment he was sure hed walked into a nightmare this was too much on top of everything that had happened so farthey werent in a room as he had supposed they were in a corridor the forbidden corridor on the third floor and now they knew why it was forbiddenthey were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor it had three headsthree pairs of rolling mad eyes three noses twitching and quivering in their direction three drooling mouths saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangsit was standing quite still all six eyes staring at them and harry knew that the only reason they werent already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise but it was quickly getting over that there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meantharry groped for the doorknob between filch and death hed take filchthey fell backward harry slammed the door shut and they ran they almost flew back down the corridor filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else because they didnt see him anywhere but they hardly cared all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster they didnt stop running until they reached the portrait of the fat lady on the seventh floorwhere on earth have you all been she asked looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed sweaty facesnever mind that pig snout pig snout panted harry and the portrait swung forward they scrambled into the common room and collapsed trembling into armchairsit was a while before any of them said anything neville indeed looked as if hed never speak againwhat do they think theyre doing keeping a thing like that locked up in a school said ron finally if any dog needs exercise that one doeshermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again you dont use your eyes any of you do you she snapped didnt you see what it was standing onthe floor harry suggested i wasnt looking at its feet i was too busy with its headsno not the floor it was standing on a trapdoor its obviously guarding somethingshe stood up glaring at themi hope youre pleased with yourselves we could all have been killed or worse expelled now if you dont mind im going to bedron stared after her his mouth openno we dont mind he said youd think we dragged her along wouldnt youbut hermione had given harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed the dog was guarding something what had hagrid said gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide except perhaps hogwartsit looked as though harry had found out where the grubby littie package from vault seven hundred and thirteen waschapter tenhalloweenmalfoy couldnt believe his eyes when he saw that harry and ron were still at hogwarts the next day looking tired but perfectly cheerfulindeed by the next morning harry and ron thought that meeting the threeheaded dog had been an excellent adventure and they were quite keen to have another one in the meantime harry filled ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from gringotts to hogwarts and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection its either really valuable or really dangerous said ronor both said harrybut as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long they didnt have much chance of guessing what it was without further cluesneither neville nor hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor all neville cared about was never going near the dog againhermione was now refusing to speak to harry and ron but she was such a bossy knowitall that they saw this as an added bonus all they really wanted now was a way of getting back at malfoy and to their great delight just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week lateras the owls flooded into the great hall as usual everyones attention was caught at once by a long thin package carried by six large screech owls harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him knocking his bacon to the floor they had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcelharry ripped open the letter first which was lucky because it said do not open the parcel at the tableit contains your new nimbus two thousand but i dont want everybody knowing youve got a broomstick or theyll all want one oliver wood will meet you tonight on the quidditch field at seven oclock for your first training sessionprofessor mcgonagall harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to ron to reada nimbus two thousand ron moaned enviously ive never even touched onethey left the hall quickly wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by crabbe and goyle malfoy seized the package from harry and felt itthats a broomstick he said throwing it back to harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face youll be in for it this time potter first years arent allowed themron couldnt resist itits not any old broomstick he said its a nimbus two thousandwhat did you say youve got at home malfoy a comet two sixty ron grinned at harry comets look flashy but theyre not in the same league as the nimbuswhat would you know about it weasley you couldnt afford half the handle malfoy snapped back i suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twigbefore ron could answer professor flitwick appeared at malfoys elbownot arguing i hope boys he squeakedpotters been sent a broomstick professor said malfoy quicklyyes yes thats right said professor flitwick beaming at harryprofessor mcgonagall told me all about the special circumstances potter and what model is ita nimbus two thousand sit said harry fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on malfoys face and its really thanks to malfoy here that ive got it he addedharry and ron headed upstairs smothering their laughter at malfoys obvious rage and confusion well its true harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase if he hadnt stolen nevilles remembrall i woulnt be on the teamso i suppose you think thats a reward for breaking rules came an angry voice from just behind them hermione was stomping up the stairs looking disapprovingly at the package in harrys handi thought you werent speaking to us said harryyes dont stop now said ron its doing us so much goodhermione marched away with her nose in the airharry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day it kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed or straying off to the quidditch field where hed be learning to play that night he bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating and then rushed upstairs with ron to unwrap the nimbus two thousand at lastwow ron sighed as the broomstick rolled onto harrys bedspreadeven harry who knew nothing about the different brooms thought it looked wonderful sleek and shiny with a mahogany handle it had a long tail of neat straight twigs and nimbus two thousand written in gold near the topas seven oclock drew nearer harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the quidditch field held never been inside the stadium before hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on at either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end they reminded harry of the little plastic sticks muggle children blew bubbles through except that they were fifty feet hightoo eager to fly again to wait for wood harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground what a feeling he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field the nimbus two thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touchhey potter come down oliver wood had arrived fie was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm harry landed next to himvery nice said wood his eyes glinting i see what mcgonagall meant you really are a natural im just going to teach you the rules this evening then youll be joining team practice three times a weekhe opened the crate inside were four differentsized ballsright said wood now quidditch is easy enough to understand even if its not too easy to play there are seven players on each sidethree of them are called chasersthree chasers harry repeated as wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ballthis balls called the quaffle said wood the chasers throw the quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal ten points every time the quaffle goes through one of the hoops follow methe chasers throw the quaffle and put it through the hoops to scoreharry recited so thats sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops isnt itwhats basketball said wood curiously never mind said harry quicklynow theres another player on each side whos called the keeper im keeper for gryffindor i have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoringthree chasers one keeper said harry who was determined to remember it all and they play with the quaffle okay got that so what are they for he pointed at the three balls left inside the boxill show you now said wood take thishe handed harry a small club a bit like a short baseball batim going to show you what the bludgers do wood said these two are the bludgershe showed harry two identical balls jet black and slightly smaller than the red quaffle harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the boxstand back wood warned harry he bent down and freed one of the bludgersat once the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at harrys face harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose and sent it zigzagging away into the air it zoomed around their heads and then shot at wood who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the groundsee wood panted forcing the struggling bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely the bludgers rocket around trying to knock players off their brooms thats why you have two beaters on each team the weasley twins are ours its their job to protect their side from the bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team so think youve got all thatthree chasers try and score with the quaffle the keeper guards the goal posts the beaters keep the bludgers away from their team harry reeled offvery good said wooder have the bludgers ever killed anyone harry asked hoping he sounded offhandnever at hogwarts weve had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that now the last member of the team is the seeker thats you and you dont have to worry about the quaffle or the bludgers unless they crack my head opendont worry the weasleys are more than a match for the bludgers i mean theyre like a pair of human bludgers themselveswood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ballcompared with the quaffle and the bludgers it was tiny about the size of a large walnut it was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wingsthis said wood is the golden snitch and its the most important ball of the lot its very hard to catch because its so fast and difficult to see its the seekers job to catch it youve got to weave in and out of the chasers beaters bludgers and quaffle to get it before the other teams seeker because whichever seeker catches the snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points so they nearly always win thats why seekers get fouled so much a game of quidditch only ends when the snitch is caught so it can go on for ages i think the record is three months they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep well thats it any questionsharry shook his head he understood what he had to do all right it was doing it that was going to be the problemwe wont practice with the snitch yet said wood carefully shutting it back inside the crate its too dark we might lose it lets try you out with a few of thesehe pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later he and harry were up in the air wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for harry to catchharry didnt miss a single one and wood was delighted after half an hour night had really fallen and they couldnt carry onthat quidditch cupll have our name on it this year said wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle i wouldnt be surprised if you turn out better than charlie weasley and he could have played for england if he hadnt gone off chasing dragonsperhaps it was because he was now so busy what with quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework but harry could hardly believe it when he realized that hed already been at hogwarts two months the castle felt more like home than privet drive ever had his lessons too were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basicson halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors even better professor flitwick announced in charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly something they had all been dying to try since theyd seen him make nevilles toad zoom around the classroom professor flitwick put the class into pairs to practice harrys partner was seamus finnigan which was a relief because neville had been trying to catch his eye ron however was to be working with hermione granger it was hard to tell whether ron or hermione was angrier about this she hadnt spoken to either of them since the day harrys broomstick had arrivednow dont forget that nice wrist movement weve been practicingsqueaked professor flitwick perched on top of his pile of books as usual swish and flick remember swish and flick and saying the magic words properly is very important too never forget wizard baruffio who said s instead of f and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chestit was very difficult harry and seamus swished and flicked but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it harry had to put it out with his hatron at the next table wasnt having much more luckwingardium leviosa he shouted waving his long arms like a windmillyoure saying it wrong harry heard hermione snap its winggardium leviosa make the gar nice and longyou do it then if youre so clever ron snarledhermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown flicked her wand and said wingardium leviosatheir feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their headsoh well done cried professor flitwick clapping everyone see here miss grangers done itron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class its no wonder no one can stand her he said to harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor shes a nightmare honestly Ã¢â‚¬Å“someone knocked into harry as they hurried past him it was hermioneharry caught a glimpse of her face and was startled to see that she was in tearsi think she heard youso said ron but he looked a bit uncomfortable she mustve noticed shes got no friendshermione didnt turn up for the next class and wasnt seen all afternoon on their way down to the great hall for the halloween feast harry and ron overheard parvati patil telling her friend lavender that hermione was crying in the girls bathroom and wanted to be left aloneron looked still more awkward at this but a moment later they had entered the great hall where the halloween decorations put hermione out of their mindsa thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds making the candles in the pumpkins stutter the feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates as it had at the startofterm banquetharry was just helping himself to a baked potato when professor quirrell came sprinting into the hall his turban askew and terror on his faceeveryone stared as he reached professor dumbledores chair slumped against the table and gasped troll in the dungeons thought you ought to knowhe then sank to the floor in a dead faintthere was an uproar it took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of professor dumbledores wand to bring silenceprefects he rumbled lead your houses back to the dormitories immediatelypercy was in his elementfollow me stick together first years no need to fear the troll if you follow my orders stay close behind me now make way first years coming through excuse me im a prefecthow could a troll get in harry asked as they climbed the stairsdont ask me theyre supposed to be really stupid said ron maybe peeves let it in for a halloween jokethey passed different groups of people hurrying in different directionsas they jostled their way through a crowd of confused hufflepuffs harry suddenly grabbed rons armive just thought hermionewhat about hershe doesnt know about the trollron bit his lipoh all right he snapped but percyd better not see usducking down they joined the hufflepuffs going the other way slipped down a deserted side corridor and hurried off toward the girls bathroom they had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind thempercy hissed ron pulling harry behind a large stone griffinpeering around it however they saw not percy but snape he crossed the corridor and disappeared from viewwhats he doing harry whispered why isnt he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teacherssearch mequietly as possible they crept along the next corridor after snapes fading footstepshes heading for the third floor harry said but ron held up his handcan you smell somethingharry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to cleanand then they heard it a low grunting and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet ron pointed at the end of a passage to the left something huge was moving toward them they shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlightit was a horrible sight twelve feet tall its skin was a dull granite gray its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut it had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat horny feet the smell coming from it was incredible it was holding a huge wooden club which dragged along the floor because its arms were so longthe troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside it waggled its long ears making up its tiny mind then slouched slowly into the roomthe keys in the lock harry muttered we could lock it ingood idea said ron nervouslythey edged toward the open door mouths dry praying the troll wasnt about to come out of it with one great leap harry managed to grab the key slam the door and lock ityesflushed with their victory they started to run back up the passage but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop a high petrified scream and it was coming from the chamber theyd just chained upoh no said ron pale as the bloody baronits the girls bathroom harry gaspedhermione they said togetherit was the last thing they wanted to do but what choice did they have wheeling around they sprinted back to the door and turned the key fumbling in their panic harry pulled the door open and they ran insidehermione granger was shrinking against the wall opposite looking as if she was about to faint the troll was advancing on her knocking the sinks off the walls as it wentconfuse it harry said desperately to ron and seizing a tap he threw it as hard as he could against the wallthe troll stopped a few feet from hermione it lumbered around blinking stupidly to see what had made the noise its mean little eyes saw harry it hesitated then made for him instead lifting its club as it wentoy peabrain yelled ron from the other side of the chamber and he threw a metal pipe at it the troll didnt even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder but it heard the yell and paused again turning its ugly snout toward ron instead giving harry time to run around itcome on run run harry yelled at hermione trying to pull her toward the door but she couldnt move she was still flat against the wall her mouth open with terrorthe shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk it roared again and started toward ron who was nearest and had no way to escapeharry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid he took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the trolls neck from behind the troll couldnt feel harry hanging there but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose and harrys wand had still been in his hand when hed jumped it had gone straight up one of the trolls nostrilshowling with pain the troll twisted and flailed its club with harry clinging on for dear life any second the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the clubhermione had sunk to the floor in fright ron pulled out his own wand not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head wingardium leviosathe club flew suddenly out of the trolls hand rose high high up into the air turned slowly over and dropped with a sickening crack onto its owners head the troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face with a thud that made the whole room trembleharry got to his feet he was shaking and out of breath ron was standing there with his wand still raised staring at what he had doneit was hermione who spoke firstis it deadi dont think so said harry i think its just been knocked outhe bent down and pulled his wand out of the trolls nose it was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glueurgh troll boogershe wiped it on the trolls trousersa sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look upthey hadnt realized what a racket they had been making but of course someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the trolls roars a moment later professor mcgonagall had come bursting into the room closely followed by snape with quirrell bringing up the rear quirrell took one look at the troll let out a faint whimper and sat quickly down on a toilet clutching his heartsnape bent over the troll professor mcgonagall was looking at ron and harry harry had never seen her look so angry her lips were whitehopes of winning fifty points for gryffindor faded quickly from harrys mindwhat on earth were you thinking of said professor mcgonagall with cold fury in her voice harry looked at ron who was still standing with his wand in the air youre lucky you werent killed why arent you in your dormitorysnape gave harry a swift piercing look harry looked at the floor he wished ron would put his wand downthen a small voice came out of the shadowsplease professor mcgonagall they were looking for memiss grangerhermione had managed to get to her feet at lasti went looking for the troll because i i thought i could deal with it on my own you know because ive read all about themron dropped his wand hermione granger telling a downright lie to a teacher if they hadnt found me id be dead now harry stuck his wand up its nose and ron knocked it out with its own club they didnt have time to come and fetch anyone it was about to finish me off when they arrivedharry and ron tried to look as though this story wasnt new to themwell in that case said professor mcgonagall staring at the three of them miss granger you foolish girl how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your ownhermione hung her head harry was speechless hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules and here she was pretending she had to get them out of trouble it was as if snape had started handing out sweetsmiss granger five points will be taken from gryffindor for this said professor mcgonagall im very disappointed in you if youre not hurt at all youd better get off to gryffindor tower students are finishing the feast in their houseshermione leftprofessor mcgonagall turned to harry and ronwell i still say you were lucky but not many first years could have taken on a fullgrown mountain troll you each win gryffindor five points professor dumbledore will be informed of this you may gothey hurried out of the chamber and didnt speak at all until they had climbed two floors up it was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll quite apart from anything elsewe should have gotten more than ten points ron grumbledfive you mean once shes taken off hermionesgood of her to get us out of trouble like that ron admitted mind you we did save hershe might not have needed saving if we hadnt locked the thing in with her harry reminded himthey had reached the portrait of the fat ladypig snout they said and enteredthe common room was packed and noisy everyone was eating the food that had been sent up hermione however stood alone by the door waiting for them there was a very embarrassed pause then none of them looking at each other they all said thanks and hurried off to get platesbut from that moment on hermione granger became their friend there are some things you cant share without ending up liking each other and knocking out a twelvefoot mountain troll is one of themchapter elevenquidditchas they entered november the weather turned very cold the mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel every morning the ground was covered in frost hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the quidditch field bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat rabbit fur gloves and enormous beaverskin bootsthe quidditch season had begun on saturday harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training gryffindor versus slytherin if gryffindor won they would move up into second place in the house championshiphardly anyone had seen harry play because wood had decided that as their secret weapon harry should be kept well secret but the news that he was playing seeker had leaked out somehow and harry didnt know which was worse people telling him hed be brilliant or people telling him theyd be running around underneath him holding a mattressit was really lucky that harry now had hermlone as a friend he didnt know how hed have gotten through all his homework without her what with all the lastminute quidditch practice wood was making them do she had also tent him quidditch through the ages which turned out to be a very interesting readharry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a world cup match in that seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players and that most serious quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them that although people rarely died playing quidditch referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the sahara deserthermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since harry and ron had saved her from the mountain troll and she was much nicer for it the day before harrys first quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jarthey were standing with their backs to it getting warm when snape crossed the yard harry noticed at once that snape was limping harry ron and hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view they were sure it wouldnt be allowed unfortunately something about their guilty faces caught snapes eye he limped over he hadnt seen the fire but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anywaywhats that youve got there potterit was quidditch through the ages harry showed himlibrary books are not to be taken outside the school said snapegive it to me five points from gryffindorhes just made that rule up harry muttered angrily as snape limped away wonder whats wrong with his legdunno but i hope its really hurting him said ron bitterlythe gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening harry ron and hermione sat together next to a window hermione was checking harry and rons charms homework for them she would never let them copy how will you learn but by asking her to read it through they got the right answers anywayharry felt restless he wanted quidditch through the ages back to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow why should he be afraid of snape getting up he told ron and hermione he was going to ask snape if he could have itbetter you than me they said together but harry had an idea that snape wouldnt refuse if there were other teachers listeninghe made his way down to the staffroom and knocked there was no answerhe knocked again nothingperhaps snape had left the book in there it was worth a try he pushed the door ajar and peered inside and a horrible scene met his eyessnape and filch were inside alone snape was holding his robes above his knees one of his legs was bloody and mangled filch was handing snape bandagesblasted thing snape was saying how are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at onceharry tried to shut the door quietly but pottersnapes face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to hide his leg harry gulpedi just wondered if i could have my book backget out outharry left before snape could take any more points from gryffindor he sprinted back upstairsdid you get it ron asked as harry joined them whats the matterin a low whisper harry told them what hed seenyou know what this means he finished breathlessly he tried to get past that threeheaded dog at halloween thats where he was going when we saw him hes after whatever its guarding and id bet my broomstick he let that troll in to make a diversionhermiones eyes were wideno he wouldnt she said i know hes not very nice but he wouldnt try and steal something dumbledore was keeping safehonestly hermione you think all teachers are saints or somethingsnapped ron im with harry i wouldnt put anything past snape but whats he after whats that dog guardingharry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question neville was snoring loudly but harry couldnt sleep he tried to empty his mind he needed to sleep he had to he had his first quidditch match in a few hours but the expression on snapes face when harry had seen his leg wasnt easy to forgetthe next morning dawned very bright and cold the great hall was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheer ful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good quidditch matchyouve got to eat some breakfasti dont want anythingjust a bit of toast wheedled hermioneim not hungryharry felt terrible in an hours time hed be walking onto the fieldharry you need your strength said seamus finnigan seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other teamthanks seamus said harry watching seamus pile ketchup on his sausagesby eleven oclock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the quidditch pitch many students had binoculars the seats might be raised high in the air but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimesron and hermione joined neville seamus and dean the west ham fan up in the top row as a surprise for harry they had painted a large banner on one of the sheets scabbers had ruined it said potter for president and dean who was good at drawing had done a large gryffindor lion underneath then hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different colorsmeanwhile in the locker room harry and the rest of the team were changing into their scarlet quidditch robes slytherin would be playing in greenwood cleared his throat for silenceokay men he saidand women said chaser angelina johnsonand women wood agreed this is itthe big one said fred weasleythe one weve all been waiting for said georgewe know olivers speech by heart fred told harry we were on the team last yearshut up you two said wood this is the best team gryffindors had in years were going to win i know ithe glared at them all as if to say or elseright its time good luck all of youharry followed fred and george out of the locker room and hoping his knees werent going to give way walked onto the field to loud cheersmadam hooch was refereeing she stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams her broom in her handnow i want a nice fair game all of you she said once they were all gathered around her harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the slytherin captain marcus flint a sixth year harry thought flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above flashing potter for president over the crowd his heart skipped he felt bravermount your brooms pleaseharry clambered onto his nimbus two thousandmadam hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistlefifteen brooms rose up high high into the air they were off and the quaffle is taken immediately by angelina johnson of gryffindor what an excellent chaser that girl is and rather attractive too jordansorry professorthe weasley twins friend lee jordan was doing the commentary for the match closely watched by professor mcgonagalland shes really belting along up there a neat pass to alicia spinnet a good find of oliver woods last year only a reserve back to johnson and no the slytherins have taken the quaffle slytherin captain marcus flint gains the quaffle and off he goes flint flying like an eagle up there hes going to sc no stopped by an excellent move by gryffindor keeper wood and the

the slytherins thats adrian pucey speeding off toward the goal posts but hes blocked by a second bludger sent his way by fred or george weasley cant tell which nice play by the gryffindor beater anyway and johnson back in possession of the quaffle a clear field ahead and off she goes shes really flying dodges a speeding bludger the goal posts are ahead come on now angelina keeper bletchley dives misses gryffindors scoregryffindor cheers filled the cold air with howls and moans from the slytherinsbudge up there move alonghagridron and hermione squeezed together to give hagrid enough space to join thembin watchin from me hut said hagrid patting a large pair of binoculars around his neck but it isnt the same as bein in the crowd no sign of the snitch yet ehnope said ron harry hasnt had much to do yetkept outta trouble though thats somethin said hagrid raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was harryway up above them harry was gliding over the game squinting about for some sign of the snitch this was part of his and woods game plankeep out of the way until you catch sight of the snitch wood had said we dont want you attacked before you have to bewhen angelina had scored harry had done a couple of looptheloops to let off his feelings now he was back to staring around for the snitchonce he caught sight of a flash of gold but it was just a reflection from one of the weasleys wristwatches and once a bludger decided to come pelting his way more like a cannonball than anything but harry dodged it and fred weasley came chasing after itall right there harry he had time to yell as he beat the bludger furiously toward marcus flintslytherin in possession lee jordan was saying chaser pucey ducks two bludgers two weasleys and chaser bell and speeds toward the wait a moment was that the snitcha murmur ran through the crowd as adrian pucey dropped the quaffle too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left earharry saw it in a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the streak of gold slytherin seeker terence higgs had seen it too neck and neck they hurtled toward the snitch all the chasers seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to watchharry was faster than higgs he could see the little round ball wings fluttering darting up ahead he put on an extra spurt of speed wham a roar of rage echoed from the gryffindors below marcus flint had blocked harry on purpose and harrys broom spun off course harry holding on for dear lifefoul screamed the gryffindorsmadam hooch spoke angrily to flint and then ordered a free shot at the goal posts for gryffindor but in all the confusion of course the golden snitch had disappeared from sight againdown in the stands dean thomas was yelling send him off ref red cardwhat are you talking about dean said ronred card said dean furiously in soccer you get shown the red card and youre out of the gamebut this isnt soccer dean ron reminded himhagrid however was on deans sidethey oughta change the rules flint coulda knocked harry outta the airlee jordan was finding it difficult not to take sidesso after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating jordan growled professor mcgonagalli mean after that open and revolting foul jordan im warning you all right all right flint nearly kills the gryffindor seeker which could happen to anyone im sure so a penalty to gryffindor taken by spinner who puts it away no trouble and we continue play gryffindor still in possessionit was as harry dodged another bludger which went spinning dangerously past his head that it happened his broom gave a sudden frightening lurch for a split second he thought he was going to fall he gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and knees hed never felt anything like thatit happened again it was as though the broom was trying to buck him off but nimbus two thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off harry tried to turn back toward the gryffindor goal posts he had half a mind to ask wood to call timeout and then he realized that his broom was completely out of his control he couldnt turn it he couldnt direct it at all it was zigzagging through the air and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated himlee was still commentatingslytherin in possession flint with the quaffle passes spinnet passes bell hit hard in the face by a bludger hope it broke his nose only joking professor slytherins score a nothe slytherins were cheering no one seemed to have noticed that harrys broom was behaving strangely it was carrying him slowly higher away from the game jerking and twitching as it wentdunno what harry thinks hes doing hagrid mumbled he stared through his binoculars if i didn know better id say hed lost control of his broom but he cant havesuddenly people were pointing up at harry all over the stands his broom had started to roll over and over with him only just managing to hold on then the whole crowd gasped harrys broom had given a wild jerk and harry swung off it he was now dangling from it holding on with only one handdid something happen to it when flint blocked him seamus whisperedcant have hagrid said his voice shaking cant nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful dark magic no kid could do that to a nimbus two thousandat these words hermione seized hagrids binoculars but instead of looking up at harry she started looking frantically at the crowdwhat are you doing moaned ron grayfacedi knew it hermione gasped snape lookron grabbed the binoculars snape was in the middle of the stands opposite them he had his eyes fixed on harry and was muttering nonstop under his breathhes doing something jinxing the broom said hermionewhat should we doleave it to mebefore ron could say another word hermione had disappeared ron turned the binoculars back on harry his broom was vibrating so hard it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer the whole crowd was on its feet watching terrified as the weasleys flew up to try and pull harry safely onto one of their brooms but it was no good every time they got near him the broom would jump higher still they dropped lower and circled beneath him obviously hoping to catch him if he fellmarcus flint seized the quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticingcome on hermione ron muttered desperatelyhermione had fought her way across to the stand where snape stood and was now racing along the row behind him she didnt even stop to say sorry as she knocked professor quirrell headfirst into the row in frontreaching snape she crouched down pulled out her wand and whispered a few well chosen words bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of snapes robesit took perhaps thirty seconds for snape to realize that he was on firea sudden yelp told her she had done her job scooping the fire off him into a little jar in her pocket she scrambled back along the row snape would never know what had happenedit was enough up in the air harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broomneville you can look ron said neville had been sobbing into hagrids jacket for the last five minutesharry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick he hit the field on all fours coughed and something gold fell into his handive got the snitch he shouted waving it above his head and the game ended in complete confusionhe didnt catch it he nearly swallowed it flint was still howling twenty minutes later but it made no difference harry hadnt broken any rules and lee jordan was still happily shouting the results gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty harry heard none of this though he was being made a cup of strong tea back in hagrids hut with ron and hermioneit was snape ron was explaining hermione and i saw him he was cursing your broomstick muttering he wouldnt take his eyes off yourubbish said hagrid who hadnt heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stands why would snape do somethin like thatharry ron and hermione looked at one another wondering what to tell him harry decided on the truthi found out something about him he told hagrid he tried to get past that threeheaded dog on halloween it bit him we think he was trying to steal whatever its guardinghagrid dropped the teapothow do you know about fluffy he saidfluffyyeah hes mine bought him off a greek chappie i met in the pub las year i lent him to dumbledore to guard the yes said harry eagerlynow dont ask me anymore said hagrid gruffly thats top secret that isbut snapes trying to steal itrubbish said hagrid again snapes a hogwarts teacher hed do nothin of the sortso why did he just try and kill harry cried hermionethe afternoons events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about snapei know a jinx when i see one hagrid ive read all about them youve got to keep eye contact and snape wasnt blinking at all i saw himim tellin yeh yer wrong said hagrid hotly i don know why harrys broom acted like that but snape wouldn try an kill a student now listen to me all three of yeh yer meddlin in things that don concern yeh its dangerous you forget that dog an you forget what its guardin thats between professor dumbledore an nicolas flamel aha said harry so theres someone called nicolas flamel involved is therehagrid looked furious with himselfchapter twelvethe mirror of erisedchristmas was coming one morning in middecember hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow the lake froze solid and the weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed quirrell around bouncing off the back of his turban the few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by hagrid before they could fly off againno one could wait for the holidays to start while the gryffindor common room and the great hall had roaring fires the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classroomsworst of all were professor snapes classes down in the dungeons where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldronsi do feel so sorry said draco malfoy one potions class for all those people who have to stay at hogwarts for christmas because theyre not wanted at homehe was looking over at harry as he spoke crabbe and goyle chuckledharry who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish ignored themmalfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the quidditch match disgusted that the slytherins had lost he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a widemouthed tree frog would be replacing harry as seeker next then hed realized that nobody found this funny because they were all so impressed at the way harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick so malfoy jealous and angry had gone back to taunting harry about having no proper familyit was true that harry wasnt going back to privet drive for christmasprofessor mcgonagall had come around the week before making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays and harry had signed up at once he didnt feel sorry for himself at all this would probably be the best christmas hed ever had ron and his brothers were staying too because mr and mrs weasley were going to romania to visit charliewhen they left the dungeons at the end of potions they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that hagrid was behind ithi hagrid want any help ron asked sticking his head through the branchesnah im all right thanks ronwould you mind moving out of the way came malfoys cold drawl from behind them are you trying to earn some extra money weasley hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave hogwarts i suppose that hut of hagrids must seem like a palace compared to what your familys used toron dived at malfoy just as snape came up the stairsweasleyron let go of the front of malfoys robeshe was provoked professor snape said hagrid sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree malfoy was insultin his familybe that as it may fighting is against hogwarts rules hagrid said snape silkily five points from gryffindor weasley and be grateful it isnt more move along all of youmalfoy crabbe and goyle pushed roughly past the tree scattering needles everywhere and smirkingill get him said ron grinding his teeth at malfoys back one of these days ill get him i hate them both said harry malfoy and snapecome on cheer up its nearly christmas said hagrid tell yeh what come with me an see the great hall looks a treatso the three of them followed hagrid and his tree off to the great hall where professor mcgonagall and professor flitwick were busy with the christmas decorationsah hagrid the last tree put it in the far corner would youthe hall looked spectacular festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls and no less than twelve towering christmas trees stood around the room some sparkling with tiny icicles some glittering with hundreds of candleshow many days you got left until yer holidays hagrid askedjust one said hermione and that reminds me harry ron weve got half an hour before lunch we should be in the libraryoh yeah youre right said ron tearing his eyes away from professor flitwick who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new treethe library said hagrid following them out of the hall just before the holidays bit keen arent yehoh were not working harry told him brightly ever since you mentioned nicolas flamel weve been trying to find out who he isyou what hagrid looked shocked listen here ive told yeh drop it its nothin to you what that dogs guardinwe just want to know who nicolas flamel is thats all said hermioneunless youd like to tell us and save us the trouble harry added we mustve been through hundreds of books already and we cant find him anywhere just give us a hint i know ive read his name somewhereim sayin nothin said hagrid flatlyjust have to find out for ourselves then said ron and they left hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the librarythey had indeed been searching books for flamels name ever since hagrid had let it slip because how else were they going to find out what snape was trying to steal the trouble was it was very hard to know where to begin not knowing what flamel might have done to get himself into a book he wasnt in great wizards of the twentieth century or notable magical names of our time he was missing too from important modern magical discoveries and a study of recent developments in wizardry and then of course there was the sheer size of the library tens of thousands of books thousands of shelves hundreds of narrow rowshermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random harry wandered over to the restricted section he had been wondering for a while if flamel wasnt somewhere in there unfortunately you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books and he knew hed never get one these were the books containing powerful dark magic never taught at hogwarts and only read by older students studying advanced defense against the dark artswhat are you looking for boynothing said harrymadam pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at himyoud better get out then go on outwishing hed been a bit quicker at thinking up some story harry left the library he ron and hermione had already agreed theyd better not ask madam pince where they could find flamel they were sure shed be able to tell them but they couldnt risk snape hearing what they were up toharry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything but he wasnt very hopeful they had been looking for two weeks after a but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasnt surprising theyd found nothing what they really needed was a nice long search without madam pince breathing down their necksfive minutes later ron and hermione joined him shaking their headsthey went off to lunchyou will keep looking while im away wont you said hermione and send me an owl if you find anythingand you could ask your parents if they know who flamel is said ronitd be safe to ask themvery safe as theyre both dentists said hermioneonce the holidays had started ron and harry were having too good a time to think much about flamel they had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire they sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork bread english muffins marshmallows and plotting ways of getting malfoy expelled which were fun to talk about even if they wouldnt workron also started teaching harry wizard chess this was exactly like muggle chess except that the figures were alive which made it a lot like directing troops in battle rons set was very old and batteredlike everything else he owned it had once belonged to someone else in his family in this case his grandfather however old chessmen werent a drawback at all ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wantedharry played with chessmen seamus finnigan had lent him and they didnt trust him at all he wasnt a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him which was confusing dont send me there cant you see his knight send him we can afford to lose him on christmas eve harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun but not expecting any presents at allwhen he woke early in the morning however the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bedmerry christmas said ron sleepily as harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobeyou too said harry will you look at this ive got some presentswhat did you expect turnips said ron turning to his own pile which was a lot bigger than harrysharry picked up the top parcel it was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was to harry from hagrid inside was a roughly cut wooden flute hagrid had obviously whittled it himself harry blew it it sounded a bit like an owla second very small parcel contained a notewe received your message and enclose your christmas present from uncle vernon and aunt petunia taped to the note was a fiftypence piecethats friendly said harryron was fascinated by the fifty penceweird he said nmat a shape this is moneyyou can keep it said harry laughing at how pleased ron was hagrid and my aunt and uncle so who sent thesei think i know who that ones from said ron turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel my mom i told her you didnt expect any presents and oh no he groaned shes made you a weasley sweaterharry had torn open the parcel to find a thick handknitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudgeevery year she makes us a sweater said ron unwrapping his own and mines always maroonthats really nice of her said harry trying the fudge which was very tastyhis next present also contained candy a large box of chocolate frogs from hermionethis only left one parcel harry picked it up and felt it it was very light he unwrapped itsomething fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds ron gaspedive heard of those he said in a hushed voice dropping the box of every flavor beans hed gotten from hermione if thats what i think it is theyre really rare and really valuablewhat is itharry picked the shining silvery cloth off the floor it was strange to the touch like water woven into materialits an invisibility cloak said ron a look of awe on his face im sure it is try it onharry threw the cloak around his shoulders and ron gave a yellit is look downharry looked down at his feet but they were gone he dashed to the mirror sure enough his reflection looked back at him just his head suspended in midair his body completely invisible he pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completelytheres a note said ron suddenly a note fell out of itharry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter written in narrow loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words your father left this in my possession before he died it is time it was returned to you use it wella very merry christmas to youthere was no signature harry stared at the note ron was admiring the cloakid give anything for one of these he said anything whats the matternothing said harry he felt very strange who had sent the cloak had it really once belonged to his father before he could say or think anything else the dormitory door was flung open and fred and george weasley bounded in harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight he didnt feel like sharing it with anyone else yetmerry christmashey look harrys got a weasley sweater toofred and george were wearing blue sweaters one with a large yellow f on it the other a gharrys is better than ours though said fred holding up harrys sweater she obviously makes more of an effort if youre not familywhy arent you wearing yours ron george demanded come on get it on theyre lovely and warmi hate maroon ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his headyou havent got a letter on yours george observed i suppose she thinks you dont forget your name but were not stupid we know were called gred and forgewhats all th is noisepercy weasley stuck his head through the door looking disapproving he had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he too carried a lumpy sweater over his arm which fred seizedp for prefect get it on percy come on were all wearing ours even harry got onei dont want said percy thickly as the twins forced the sweater over his head knocking his glasses askewand youre not sitting with the prefects today either said george christmas is a time for familythey frogmarched percy from the room his arms pinned to his side by his sweaterharry had never in all his life had such a christmas dinner a hundred fat roast turkeys mountains of roast and boiled potatoes platters of chipolatas tureens of buttered peas silver boats of thick rich gravy and cranberry sauce and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table these fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble muggle ones the dursleys usually bought with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside harry pulled a wizard cracker with fred and it didnt just bang it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke while from the inside exploded a rear admirals hat and several live white mice up at the high table dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizards hat for a flowered bonnet and was chuckling merrily at a joke professor flitwick had just read himflaming christmas puddings followed the turkey percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice harry watched hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine finally kissing professor mcgonagall on the cheek who to harrys amazement giggled and blushed her top hat lopsidedwhen harry finally left the table he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers including a pack of nonexplodable luminous balloons a growyourownwarts kit and his own new wizard chess setthe white mice had disappeared and harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as mrs norriss christmas dinnerharry and the weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds then cold wet and gasping for breath they returned to the fire in the gryffindor common room where harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to ron he suspected he wouldnt have lost so badly if percy hadnt tried to help him so muchafter a meal of turkey sandwiches crumpets trifle and christmas cake everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch percy chase fred and george all over gryffindor tower because theyd stolen his prefect badgeit had been harrys best christmas day ever yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it the invisibility cloak and whoever had sent itron full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him fell asleep almost as soon as hed drawn the curtains of his fourposter harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under ithis fathers this had been his fathers he let the material flow over his hands smoother than silk light as air use it well the note had saidhe had to try it now he slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself looking down at his legs he saw only moonlight and shadows it was a very funny feelinguse it wellsuddenly harry felt wideawake the whole of hogwarts was open to him in this cloak excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark and silence he could go anywhere in this anywhere and filch would never knowron grunted in his sleep should harry wake him something held him back his fathers cloak he felt that this time the first time he wanted to use it alonehe crept out of the dormitory down the stairs across the common room and climbed through the portrait holewhos there squawked the fat lady harry said nothing he walked quickly down the corridorwhere should he go he stopped his heart racing and thought and then it came to him the restricted section in the library hed be able to read as long as he liked as long as it took to find out who flamel washe set off drawing the invisibility cloak tight around him as he walkedthe library was pitchblack and very eerie harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books the lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair and even though harry could feel his arm supporting it the sight gave him the creepsthe restricted section was right at the back of the library step ping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library he held up his lamp to read the titlesthey didnt tell him much their peeling faded gold letters spelled words in languages harry couldnt understand some had no title at allone book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood the hairs on the back of harrys neck prickled maybe he was imagining it maybe not but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books as though they knew someone was there who shouldnt behe had to start somewhere setting the lamp down carefully on the floor he looked along the bottom shelf for an interestinglooking book a large black and silver volume caught his eye he pulled it out with difficulty because it was very heavy and balancing it on his knee let it fall opena piercing bloodcurdling shriek split the silence the book was screaming harry snapped it shut but the shriek went on and on one high unbroken earsplitting note he stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp which went out at once panicking he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf he ran for it he passed filch in the doorway filchs pale wild eyes looked straight through him and harry slipped under filchs outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor the books shrieks still ringing in his earshe came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor he had been so busy getting away from the library he hadnt paid attention to where he was going perhaps because it was dark he didnt recognize where he was at all there was a suit of armor near the kitchens he knew but he must be five floors above thereyou asked me to come directly to you professor if anyone was wandering around at night and somebodys been in the library restricted sectionharry felt the blood drain out of his face wherever he was filch must know a shortcut because his soft greasy voice was getting nearer and to his horror it was snape who replied the restricted section well they cant be far well catch themharry stood rooted to the spot as filch and snape came around the corner ahead they couldnt see him of course but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer theyd knock right into him the cloak didnt stop him from being solidhe backed away as quietly as he could a door stood ajar to his left it was his only hope he squeezed through it holding his breath trying not to move it and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything they walked straight past and harry leaned against the wall breathing deeply listening to their footsteps dying away that had been close very close it was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden init looked like an unused classroom the dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls and there was an upturned wastepaper basket but propped against the wall facing him was something that didnt look as if it belonged there something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the wayit was a magnificent mirror as high as the ceiling with an ornate gold frame standing on two clawed feet there was an inscription carved around the top erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi his panic fading now that there was no sound of filch and snape harry moved nearer to the mirror wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again he stepped in front of ithe had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming he whirled around his heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed for he had seen not only himself in the mirror but a whole crowd of people standing right behind himbut the room was empty breathing very fast he turned slowly back to the mirrorthere he was reflected in it white and scaredlooking and there reflected behind him were at least ten others harry looked over his shoulder but still no one was there or were they all invisible too was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirrors trick was that it reflected them invisible or not he looked in the mirror again a woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving he reached out a hand and felt the air behind him if she was really there hed touch her their reflections were so close together but he felt only air she and the others existed only in the mirrorshe was a very pretty woman she had dark red hair and her eyes her eyes are just like mine harry thought edging a little closer to the glass bright green exactly the same shape but then he noticed that she was crying smiling but crying at the same time the tall thin blackhaired man standing next to her put his arm around her he wore glasses and his hair was very untidy it stuck up at the back just as harrys didharry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflectionmom he whispered dadthey just looked at him smiling and slowly harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror and saw other pairs of green eyes like his other noses like his even a little old man who looked as though he had harrys knobbly knees harry was looking at his family for the first time in his lifethe potters smiled and waved at harry and he stared hungrily back at them his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them he had a powerful kind of ache inside him half joy half terrible sadnesshow long he stood there he didnt know the reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses he couldnt stay here he had to find his way back to bed he tore his eyes away from his mothers face whispered ill come backand hurried from the roomyou could have woken me up said ron crosslyyou can come tonight im going back i want to show you the mirrorid like to see your mom and dad ron said eagerlyand i want to see all your family all the weasleys youll be able to show me your other brothers and everyoneyou can see them any old time said ron just come round my house this summer anyway maybe it only shows dead people shame about not finding flamel though have some bacon or something why arent you eating anythingharry couldnt eat he had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight he had almost forgotten about flamel it didnt seem very important anymore who cared what the three headed dog was guarding what did it matter if snape stole it really are you all right said ron you look oddwhat harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again with ron covered in the cloak too they had to walk much more slowly the next night they tried retracing harrys route from the library wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hourim freezing said ron lets forget it and go backno harry hissed i know its here somewherethey passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction but saw no one else just as ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold harry spotted the suit of armorits here just here yesthey pushed the door open harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirrorthere they were his mother and father beamed at the sight of himsee harry whisperedi cant see anythinglook look at them all there are loads of themi can only see youlook in it properly go on stand where i amharry stepped aside but with ron in front of the mirror he couldnt see his family anymore just ron in his paisley pajamasron though was staring transfixed at his imagelook at me he saidcan you see all your family standing around youno im alone but im different i look older and im head boywhati am im wearing the badge like bill used to and im holding the house cup and the quidditch cup im quidditch captain tooron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at harrydo you think this mirror shows the futurehow can it all my family are dead let me have another look you had it to yourself all last night give me a bit more timeyoure only holding the quidditch cup whats interesting about that i want to see my parentsdont push me a sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussionthey hadnt realized how loudly they had been talkingquickron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of mrs norris came round the door ron and harry stood quite still both thinking the same thing did the cloak work on cats after what seemed an age she turned and leftthis isnt safe she might have gone for filch i bet she heard uscome onand ron pulled harry out of the roomthe snow still hadnt melted the next morningwant to play chess harry said ronnowhy dont we go down and visit hagridno you goi know what youre thinking about harry that mirror dont go back tonightwhy noti dunno ive just got a bad feeling about it and anyway youve had too many close shaves already filch snape and mrs norris are wandering around so what if they cant see you what if they walk into you what if you knock something overyou sound like hermioneim serious harry dont gobut harry only had one thought in his head which was to get back in front of the mirror and ron wasnt going to stop himthat third night he found his way more quickly than before he was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise but he didnt meet anyoneand there were his mother and father smiling at him again and one of his grandfathers nodding happily harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror there was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family nothing at allexcept so back again harryharry felt as though his insides had turned to ice he looked behind him sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than albus dumbledore harry must have walked straight past him so desperate to get to the mirror he hadnt noticed himi didnt see you sirstrange how nearsighted being invisible can make you said dumbledore and harry was relieved to see that he was smilingso said dumbledore slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with harry you like hundreds before you have discovered the delights of the mirror of erisedi didnt know it was called that sirbut i expect youve realized by now what it doesit well it shows me my family and it showed your friend ron himself as head boyhow did you know i dont need a cloak to become invisible said dumbledore gentlynow can you think what the mirror of erised shows us allharry shook his headlet me explain the happiest man on earth would be able to use the mirror of erised like a normal mirror that is he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is does that helpharry thought then he said slowly it shows us what we wantwhatever we wantyes and no said dumbledore quietly it shows us nothing more or less than the deepest most desperate desire of our hearts you who have never known your family see them standing around you ronald weasley who has always been overshadowed by his brothers sees himself standing alone the best of all of them however this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth men have wasted away before it entranced by what they have seen or been driven mad not knowing if what it shows is real or even possiblethe mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow harry and i ask you not to go looking for it again if you ever do run across it you will now be prepared it does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live remember that now why dont you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bedharry stood upsir professor dumbledore can i ask you somethingobviously youve just done so dumbledore smiled you may ask me one more thing howeverwhat do you see when you look in the mirrori i see myself holding a pair of thick woolen socksharry staredone can never have enough socks said dumbledore another christmas has come and gone and i didnt get a single pair people will insist on giving me booksit was only when he was back in bed that it struck harry that dumbledore might not have been quite truthful but then he thought as he shoved scabbers off his pillow it had been quite a personal questionchapter thirteennicolas flameldumbledore had convinced harry not to go looking for the mirror of erised again and for the rest of the christmas holidays the invisibility cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk harry wished he could forget what hed seen in the mirror as easily but he couldnt he started having nightmares over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light while a high voice cackled with laughteryou see dumbledore was right that mirror could drive you mad said ron when harry told him about these drearnshermione who came back the day before term started took a different view of things she was torn between horror at the idea of harry being out of bed roaming the school three nights in a row if filch had caught you and disappointment that he hadnt at least found out who nicolas flamel wasthey had almost given up hope of ever finding flamel in a li brary book even though harry was still sure hed read the name somewhereonce term had started they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks harry had even less time than the other two because quidditch practice had started againwood was working the team harder than ever even the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldnt dampen his spirits the weasleys complained that wood was becoming a fanatic but harry was on woods side if they won their next match against hufflepuff they would overtake slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven years quite apart from wanting to win harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after trainingthen during one particularly wet and muddy practice session wood gave the team a bit of bad news hed just gotten very angry with the weasleys who kept divebombing each other and pretending to fall off their broomswill you stop messing around he yelled thats exactly the sort of thing thatll lose us the match snapes refereeing this time and hell be looking for any excuse to knock points off gryffindorgeorge weasley really did fall off his broom at these wordssnapes refereeing he spluttered through a mouthful of mud whens he ever refereed a quidditch match hes not going to be fair if we might overtake slytherinthe rest of the team landed next to george to complain tooits not my fault said wood weve just got to make sure we play a clean game so snape hasnt got an excuse to pick on uswhich was all very well thought harry but he had another reason for not wanting snape near him while he was playing quidditchthe rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice but harry headed straight back to the gryffindor common room where he found ron and hermione playing chess chess was the only thing hermione ever lost at something harry and ron thought was very good for herdont talk to me for a moment said ron when harry sat down next to him i need to concen he caught sight of harrys face whats the matter with you you look terriblespeaking quietly so that no one else would hear harry told the other two about snapes sudden sinister desire to be a quidditch refereedont play said hermione at oncesay youre ill said ronpretend to break your leg hermione suggestedreally break your leg said roni cant said harry there isnt a reserve seeker if i back out gryffindor cant play at allat that moment neville toppled into the common room how he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyones guess because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the leglocker curse he must have had to bunny hop all the way up to gryffindor towereveryone fell over laughing except hermione who leapt up and performed the countercurse nevilles legs sprang apart and he got to his feet trembling what happened hermione asked him leading him over to sit with harry and ronmalfoy said neville shakily i met him outside the library he said hed been looking for someone to practice that ongo to professor mcgonagall hermione urged neville report himneville shook his headi dont want more trouble he mumbledyouve got to stand up to him neville said ron hes used to walking all over people but thats no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easiertheres no need to tell me im not brave enough to be in gryffindor malfoys already done that neville choked outharry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a chocolate frog the very last one from the box hermione had given him for christmas he gave it to neville who looked as though he might cryyoure worth twelve of malfoy harry said the sorting hat chose you for gryffindor didnt it and wheres malfoy in stinking slytherinnevilles lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frogthanks harry i think ill go to bed dyou want the card you collect them dont youas neville walked away harry looked at the famous wizard carddumbledore again he said he was the first one i everhe gasped he stared at the back of the card then he looked up at ron and hermioneive found him he whispered ive found flamel i told you id read the name somewhere before i read it on the train coming here listen to this dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard grindelwald in for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragons blood and his work on alchemy with his partner nicolas flamelhermione jumped to her feet she hadnt looked so excited since theyd gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homeworkstay there she said and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls dormitories harry and ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back an enormous old book in her armsi never thought to look in here she whispered excitedly i got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light readinglight said ron but hermione told him to be quiet until shed looked something up and started flicking frantically through the pages muttering to herselfat last she found what she was looking fori knew it i knew itare we allowed to speak yet said ron grumpily hermione ignored himnicolas flamel she whispered dramatically is the only known maker of the sorcerers stonethis didnt have quite the effect shed expectedthe what said harry and ronoh honestly dont you two read look read that thereshe pushed the book toward them and harry and ron read the ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the sorcerers stone a legendary substance with astonishing powers the stone will transform any metal into pure gold it also produces the elixir of life which will make the drinker immortalthere have been many reports of the sorcerers stone over the centuries but the only stone currently in existence belongs to mr nicolas flamel the noted alchemist and opera lover mr flamel who celebrated his six hundred and sixtyfifth birthday last year enjoys a quiet life in devon with his wife perenelle six hundred and fiftyeightsee said hermione when harry and ron had finished the dog must be guarding flamels sorcerers stone i bet he asked dumbledore to keep it safe for him because theyre friends and he knew someone was after it thats why he wanted the stone moved out of gringottsa stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying said harry no wonder snapes after it anyone would want itand no wonder we couldnt find flamel in that study of recent developments in wizardry said ron hes not exactly recent if hes six hundred and sixtyfive is hethe next morning in defense against the dark arts while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites harry and ron were still discussing what theyd do with a sorcerers stone if they had one it wasnt until ron said hed buy his own quidditch team that harry remembered about snape and the coming matchim going to play he told ron and hermione if i dont all the slytherins will think im just too scared to face snape ill show them itll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we winjust as long as were not wiping you off the field said hermioneas the match drew nearer however harry became more and more nervous whatever he told ron and hermione the rest of the team wasnt too calm either the idea of overtaking slytherin in the house championship was wonderful no one had done it for seven years but would they be allowed to with such a biased referee harry didnt know whether he was imagining it or not but he seemed to keep running into snape wherever he went at times he even wondered whether snape was following him trying to catch him on his own potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture snape was so horrible to harry could snape possibly know theyd found out about the sorcerers stone harry didnt see how he could yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that snape could read mindsharry knew when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon that ron and hermione were wondering whether theyd ever see him alive again this wasnt what youd call comforting harry hardly heard a word of woods pep talk as he pulled on his quidditch robes and picked up his nimbus two thousandron and hermione meanwhile had found a place in the stands next to neville who couldnt understand why they looked so grim and worried or why they had both brought their wands to the match little did harry know that ron and hermione had been secretly practicing the leglocker curse theyd gotten the idea from malfoy using it on neville and were ready to use it on snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt harrynow dont forget its locomotor mortis hermione muttered as ron slipped his wand up his sleevei know ron snapped dont nagback in the locker room wood had taken harry asidedont want to pressure you potter but if we ever need an early capture of the snitch its now finish the game before snape can favor hufflepuff too muchthe whole schools out there said fred weasley peering out of the door even blimey dumbledores come to watchharrys heart did a somersaultdumbledore he said dashing to the door to make sure fred was rightthere was no mistaking that silver beardharry could have laughed out loud with relief he was safe there was simply no way that snape would dare to try to hurt him if dumbledore was watchingperhaps that was why snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field something that ron noticed tooive never seen snape look so mean he told hermione look theyre off ouchsomeone had poked ron in the back of the head it was malfoyoh sorry weasley didnt see you theremalfoy grinned broadly at crabbe and goylewonder how long potters going to stay on his broom this time anyone want a bet what about you weasleyron didnt answer snape had just awarded hufflepuff a penalty because george weasley had hit a bludger at him hermione who had all her fingers crossed in her lap was squinting fixedly at harry who was circling the game like a hawk looking for the snitchyou know how i think they choose people for the gryffindor team said malfoy loudly a few minutes later as snape awarded hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all its people they feel sorry for see theres potter whos got no parents then theres the weasleys whove got no money you should be on the team longbottom youve got no brainsneville went bright red but turned in his seat to face malfoyim worth twelve of you malfoy he stammeredmalfoy crabbe and goyle howled with laughter but ron still not daring to take his eyes from the game said you tell him nevillelongbottom if brains were gold youd be poorer than weasley and thats saying somethingrons nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about harryim warning you malfoy one more word ron said hermione suddenly harry what whereharry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd hermione stood up her crossed fingers in her mouth as harry streaked toward the ground like a bulletyoure in luck weasley potters obviously spotted some money on the ground said malfoyron snapped before malfoy knew what was happening ron was on top of him wrestling him to the ground neville hesitated then clambered over the back of his seat to helpcome on harry hermione screamed leaping onto her seat to watch as harry sped straight at snape she didnt even notice malfoy and ron rolling around under her seat or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was neville crabbe and goyleup in the air snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him missing him by inches the next second harry had pulled out of the dive his arm raised in triumph the snitch clasped in his handthe stands erupted it had to be a record no one could ever remember the snitch being caught so quicklyron ron where are you the games over harrys won weve won gryffindor is in the lead shrieked hermione dancing up and down on her seat and hugging parvati patil in the row in frontharry jumped off his broom a foot from the ground he couldnt believe it hed done it the game was over it had barely lasted five minutes as gryffindors came spilling onto the field he saw snape land nearby whitefaced and tightlipped then harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into dumbledores smiling facewell done said dumbledore quietly so that only harry could hearnice to see you havent been brooding about that mirror been keeping busy excellentsnape spat bitterly on the groundharry left the locker room alone some time later to take his nimbus two thousand back to the broomshed he couldnt ever remember feeling happier hed really done something to be proud of now no one could say he was just a famous name any more the evening air had never smelled so sweet he walked over the damp grass reliving the last hour in his head which was a happy blur gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders ron and hermione in the distance jumping up and down ron cheering through a heavy nosebleedharry had reached the shed he leaned against the wooden door and looked up at hogwarts with its windows glowing red in the setting sungryffindor in the lead hed done it hed shown snapeand speaking of snapea hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle clearly not wanting to be seen it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest harrys victory faded from his mind as he watched he recognized the figures prowling walk snape sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner what was going on harry jumped back on his nimbus two thousand and took off gliding silently over the castle he saw snape enter the forest at a run he followedthe trees were so thick he couldnt see where snape had gone he flew in circles lower and lower brushing the top branches of trees until he heard voices he glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering beech treehe climbed carefully along one of the branches holding tight to his broomstick trying to see through the leaves below in a shadowy clearing stood snape but he wasnt alone quirrell was there tooharry couldnt make out the look on his face but he was stuttering worse than ever harry strained to catch what they were sayingddont know why you wanted ttto meet here of all pplaces severusoh i thought wed keep this private said snape his voice icystudents arent supposed to know about the sorcerers stone after allharry leaned forward quirrell was mumbling something snape interrupted himhave you found out how to get past that beast of hagrids yetbbbut severus i you dont want me as your enemy quirrell said snape taking a step toward himii dont know what you you know perfectly well what i meanan owl hooted loudly and harry nearly fell out of the tree he steadied himself in time to hear snape say your little bit of hocuspocusim waitingbbut i dddont very well snape cut in well have another little chat soon when youve had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties liehe threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing it was almost dark now but harry could see quirrell standing quite still as though he was petrifiedharry where have you been hermione squeakedwe won you won we won shouted ron thumping harry on the back and i gave malfoy a black eye and neville tried to take on crabbe and goyle singlehanded hes still out cold but madam pomftey says hell be all right talk about showing slytherin everyones waiting for you in the common room were having a party fred and george stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchensnever mind that now said harry breathlessly lets find an empty room you wait til you hear thishe made sure peeves wasnt inside before shutting the door behind them then he told them what hed seen and heardso we were right it is the sorcerers stone and snapes trying to force quirrell to help him get it he asked if he knew how to get past fluffy and he said something about quirrells hocus pocuss i reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from fluffy loads of enchantments probably and quirrell would have done some antidark arts spell that snape needs to break through so you mean the stones only safe as long as quirrell stands up to snape said hermione in alarmitll be gone by next tuesday said ronchapter fourteennorbert the norwegian ridgebackquirrell however must have been braver than theyd thought in the weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner but it didnt look as though hed cracked yetevery time they passed the thirdfloor corridor harry ron and hermione would press their ears to the door to check that fluffy was still growling inside snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper which surely meant that the stone was still safe whenever harry passed quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile and ron had started telling people off for laughing at quirrells stutterhermione however had more on her mind than the sorcerers stone she had started drawing up study schedules and colorcoding all her notesharry and ron wouldnt have minded but she kept nagging them to do the samehermione the exams are ages awayten weeks hermione snapped thats not ages thats like a second to nicolas flamelbut were not six hundred years old ron reminded her anyway what are you studying for you already know it awhat am i studying for are you crazy you realize we need to pass these exams to get into the second year theyre very important i should have started studying a month ago i dont know whats gotten into meunfortunately the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as hermione they piled so much homework on them that the easter holidays werent nearly as much fun as the christmas ones it was hard to relax with hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragons blood or practicing wand movements moaning and yawning harry and ron spent most of their free time in the library with her trying to get through all their extra workill never remember this ron burst out one afternoon throwing down his quill and looking longingly out of the library window it was the first really fine day theyd had in months the sky was a clear forgetmenot blue and there was a feeling in the air of summer comingharry who was looking up dittany in one thousand magical herbs and fungi didnt look up until he heard ron say hagrid what are you doing in the libraryhagrid shuffled into view hiding something behind his back he looked very out of place in his moleskin overcoatjus lookin he said in a shifty voice that got their interest at once an whatre you lot up ter he looked suddenly suspicious yer not still lookin fer nicolas flamel are yeh oh we found out who he is ages ago said ron impressively and we know what that dogs guarding its a sorcerers st

what section he was in said ron whod had enough of working he came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms and slammed them down on the tabledragons he whispered hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons look at these dragon species of great britain and ireland from egg to inferno a dragon keepers guidehagrids always wanted a dragon he told me so the first time i ever met him said harrybut its against our laws said ron dragon breeding was outlawed by the warlocks convention of everyone knows that its hard to stop muggles from noticing us if were keeping dragons in the back garden anyway you cant tame dragons its dangerous you should see the burns charlies got off wild ones in romaniabut there arent wild dragons in britain said harryof course there are said ron common welsh green and hebridean blacks the ministry of magic has a job hushing them up i can tell youour kind have to keep putting spells on muggles whove spotted them to make them forgetso what on earths hagrid up to said hermionewhen they knocked on the door of the gamekeepers hut an hour later they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed hagrid called who is it before he let them in and then shut the door quickly behind themit was stifling hot inside even though it was such a warm day there was a blazing fire in the grate hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiches which they refusedso yeh wanted to ask me somethinyes said harry there was no point beating around the bush we were wondering if you could tell us whats guarding the sorcerers stone apart from fluffyhagrid frowned at himcourse i cant he said number one i don know meself number two yeh know too much already so i wouldn tell yeh if i could that stones here fer a good reason it was almost stolen outta gringotts i sppose yehve worked that out an all beats me how yeh even know abou fluffyoh come on hagrid you might not want to tell us but you do know you know everything that goes on round here said hermione in a warm flattering voice hagrids beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling we only wondered who had done the guarding really hermione went on we wondered who dumbledore had trusted enough to help him apart from youhagrids chest swelled at these last words harry and ron beamed at hermionewell i don spose it could hurt ter tell yeh that lets see he borrowed fluffy from me then some o the teachers did enchantmentsprofessor sprout professor flitwick professor mcgonagall he ticked them off on his fingers professor quirrell an dumbledore himself did somethin o course hang on ive forgotten someone oh yeah professor snapesnapeyeah yer not still on abou that are yeh look snape helped protect the stone hes not about ter steal itharry knew ron and hermione were thinking the same as he was if snape had been in on protecting the stone it must have been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded it he probably knew everything except it seemed quirrells spell and how to get past fluffyyoure the only one who knows how to get past fluffy arent you hagrid said harry anxiously and you wouldnt tell anyone would you not even one of the teachersnot a soul knows except me an dumbledore said hagrid proudlywell thats something harry muttered to the others hagrid can we have a window open im boilingcant harry sorry said hagrid harry noticed him glance at the fire harry looked at it toohagrid whats thatbut he already knew what it was in the very heart of the fire underneath the kettle was a huge black eggah said hagrid fiddling nervously with his beard thats erwhere did you get it hagrid said ron crouching over the fire to get a closer look at the egg it mustve cost you a fortunewon it said hagrid las night i was down in the village havin a few drinks an got into a game o cards with a stranger think he was quite glad ter get rid of it ter be honestbut what are you going to do with it when its hatched said hermionewell ive bin doin some readin said hagrid pulling a large book from under his pillow got this outta the library dragon breeding for pleasure and profit its a bit outta date o course but its all in here keep the egg in the fire cause their mothers breathe on i em see an when it hatches feed it on a bucket o brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour an see here how ter recognize diffrent eggs what i got theres a norwegian ridgeback theyre rare themhe looked very pleased with himself but hermione didnthagrid you live in a wooden house she saidbut hagrid wasnt listening he was humming merrily as he stoked the fireso now they had something else to worry about what might happen to hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hutwonder what its like to have a peaceful life ron sighed as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting hermione had now started making study schedules for harry and ron too it was driving them nutsthen one breakfast time hedwig brought harry another note from hagridhe had written only two words its hatchingron wanted to skip herbology and go straight down to the hut hermione wouldnt hear of ithermione how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatchingweve got lessons well get into trouble and thats nothing to what hagrids going to be in when someone finds out what hes doing shut up harry whisperedmalfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen how much had he heard harry didnt like the look on malfoys face at allron and hermione argued all the way to herbology and in the end hermione agreed to run down to hagrids with the other two during morning break when the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest hagrid greeted them looking flushed and excitedits nearly out he ushered them insidethe egg was lying on the table there were deep cracks in it something was moving inside a funny clicking noise was coming from itthey all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated breathall at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open the baby dragon flopped onto the table it wasnt exactly pretty harry thought it looked like a crumpled black umbrella its spiny wings were huge compared to its skinny jet body it had a long snout with wide nostrils the stubs of horns and bulging orange eyesit sneezed a couple of sparks flew out of its snoutisnt he beautiful hagrid murmured he reached out a hand to stroke the dragons head it snapped at his fingers showing pointed fangsbless him look he knows his mommy said hagridhagrid said hermione how fast do norwegian ridgebacks grow exactlyhagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his face he leapt to his feet and ran to the windowwhats the mattersomeone was lookin through the gap in the curtains its a kid hes runnin back up ter the schoolharry bolted to the door and looked out even at a distance there was no mistaking himmalfoy had seen the dragonsomething about the smile lurking on malfoys face during the next week made harry ron and hermione very nervous they spent most of their free time in hagrids darkened hut trying to reason with himjust let him go harry urged set him freei cant said hagrid hes too little hed diethey looked at the dragon it had grown three times in length in just a week smoke kept furling out of its nostrils hagrid hadnt been doing his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy there were empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floorive decided to call him norbert said hagrid looking at the dragon with misty eyes he really knows me now watch norbert norbert wheres mommyhes lost his marbles ron muttered in harrys earhagrid said harry loudly give it two weeks and norberts going to be as long as your house malfoy could go to dumbledore at any momenthagrid bit his lipi i know i cant keep him forever but i cant jus dump him i cantharry suddenly turned to ron charlie he saidyoure losing it too said ron im ron rememberno charlie your brother charlie in romania studying dragonswe could send norbert to him charlie can take care of him and then put him back in the wildbrilliant said ron how about it hagridand in the end hagrid agreed that they could send an owl to charlie to ask himthe following week dragged by wednesday night found hermione and harry sitting alone in the common room long after everyone else had gone to bed the clock on the wall had just chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off harrys invisibility cloak he had been down at hagrids hut helping him feed norbert who was now eating dead rats by the crateit bit me he said showing them his hand which was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief im not going to be able to hold a quill for a week i tell you that dragons the most horrible animal ive ever met but the way hagrid goes on about it youd think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit when it bit me he told me off for frightening it and when i left he was singing it a lullabythere was a tap on the dark windowits hedwig said harry hurrying to let her in shell have charlies answerthe three of them put their heads together to read the notedear ronhow are you thanks for the letter id be glad to take the norwegian ridgeback but it wont be easy getting him here i think the best thing will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week trouble is they mustnt be seen carrying an illegal dragoncould you get the ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on saturday they can meet you there and take him away while its still darksend me an answer as soon as possiblelovecharliethey looked at one anotherweve got the invisibility cloak said harry it shouldnt be too difficult i think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and norbertit was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him anything to get rid of norbert and malfoythere was a hitch by the next morning rons bitten hand had swollen to twice its usual size he didnt know whether it was safe to go to madam pomfrey would she recognize a dragon bite by the afternoon though he had no choice the cut had turned a nasty shade of green it looked as if norberts fangs were poisonousharry and hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find ron in a terrible state in bedits not just my hand he whispered although that feels like its about to fall off malfoy told madam pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me he kept threatening to tell her what really bit me ive told her it was a dog but i dont think she believes me i shouldnt have hit him at the quidditch match thats why hes doing thisharry and hermione tried to calm ron downitll all be over at midnight on saturday said hermione but this didnt soothe ron at all on the contrary he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweatmidnight on saturday he said in a hoarse voice oh no oh no ive just remembered charlies letter was in that book malfoy took hes going to know were getting rid of norbertharry and hermione didnt get a chance to answer madam pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave saying ron needed sleepits too late to change the plan now harry told hermione we havent got time to send charlie another owl and this could be our only chance to get rid of norbert well have to risk it and we have got the invisibility cloak malfoy doesnt know about thatthey found fang the boarhound sitting outside with a bandaged tail when they went to tell hagrid who opened a window to talk to themi wont let you in he puffed norberts at a tricky stage nothin i cant handlewhen they told him about charlies letter his eyes filled with tears although that might have been because norbert had just bitten him on the legaargh its all right he only got my boot jus playin hes only a baby after allthe baby banged its tail on the wall making the windows rattle harry and hermione walked back to the castle feeling saturday couldnt come quickly enoughthey would have felt sorry for hagrid when the time came for him to say goodbye to norbert if they hadnt been so worried about what they had to do it was a very dark cloudy night and they were a bit late arriving at hagrids hut because theyd had to wait for peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall where hed been playing tennis against the wall hagrid had norbert packed and ready in a large cratehes got lots o rats an some brandy fer the journey said hagrid in a muffled voice an ive packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonelyfrom inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to harry as though the teddy was having his head torn offbyebye norbert hagrid sobbed as harry and hermione covered the crate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it themselvesmommy will never forget youhow they managed to get the crate back up to the castle they never knew midnight ticked nearer as they heaved norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors up another staircase then another even one of harrys shortcuts didnt make the work much easiernearly there harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the tallest towerthen a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crateforgetting that they were already invisible they shrank into the shadows staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away a lamp flaredprofessor mcgonagall in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net had malfoy by the eardetention she shouted and twenty points from slytherin wandering around in the middle of the night how dare you you dont understand professor harry potters coming hes got a dragonwhat utter rubbish how dare you tell such lies come on i shall see professor snape about you malfoythe steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that not until theyd stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak glad to be able to breathe properly again hermione did a sort of jigmalfoys got detention i could singdont harry advised herchuckling about malfoy they waited norbert thrashing about in his crate about ten minutes later four broomsticks came swooping down out of the darknesscharlies friends were a cheery lot they showed harry and hermione the harness theyd rigged up so they could suspend norbert between themthey all helped buckle norbert safely into it and then harry and hermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very muchat last norbert was going going gonethey slipped back down the spiral staircase their hearts as light as their hands now that norbert was off them no more dragon malfoy in detention what could spoil their happiness the answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs as they stepped into the corridor filchs face loomed suddenly out of the darknesswell well well he whispered we are in troubletheyd left the invisibility cloak on top of the towerchapter fifteenthe foribidden forestthings couldnt have been worsefilch took them down to professor mcgonagalls study on the first floor where they sat and waited without saying a word to each other hermione was trembling excuses alibis and wild cover up stories chased each other around harrys brain each more feeble than the last he couldnt see how they were going to get out of trouble this time they were cornered how could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak there was no reason on earth that professor mcgonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of night let alone being up the tallest astronomy tower which was outofbounds except for classes add norbert and the invisibility cloak and they might as well be packing their bags alreadyhad harry thought that things couldnt have been worse he was wrongwhen professor mcgonagall appeared she was leading nevilleharry neville burst out the moment he saw the other two i was trying to find you to warn you i heard malfoy saying he was going to catch you he said you had a drag harry shook his head violently to shut neville up but professor mcgonagall had seen she looked more likely to breathe fire than norbert as she towered over the three of themi would never have believed it of any of you mr filch says you were up in the astronomy tower its one oclock in the morning explain yourselvesit was the first time hermione had ever failed to answer a teachers question she was staring at her slippers as still as a statuei think ive got a good idea of whats been going on said professor mcgonagall it doesnt take a genius to work it out you fed draco malfoy some cockandbull story about a dragon trying to get him out of bed and into trouble ive already caught him i suppose you think its funny that longbottom here heard the story and believed it tooharry caught nevilles eye and tried to tell him without words that this wasnt true because neville was looking stunned and hurt poor blundering neville harry knew what it must have cost him to try and find them in the dark to warn themim disgusted said professor mcgonagall four students out of bed in one night ive never heard of such a thing before you miss granger i thought you had more sense as for you mr potter i thought gryffindor meant more to you than this all three of you will receive detentions yes you too mr longbottom nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night especially these days its very dangerous and fifty points will be taken from gryffindorfifty harry gasped they would lose the lead the lead hed won in the last quidditch matchfifty points each said professor mcgonagall breathing heavily through her long pointed noseprofessor please you cant dont tell me what i can and cant do potter now get back to bed all of you ive never been more ashamed of gryffindor studentsa hundred and fifty points lost that put gryffindor in last place in one night theyd ruined any chance gryffindor had had for the house cup harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach how could they ever make up for this harry didnt sleep all night he could hear neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours harry couldnt think of anything to say to comfort him he knew neville like himself was dreading the dawn what would happen when the rest of gryffindor found out what theyd done at first gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the house points the next day thought thered been a mistake how could they suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday and then the story started to spread harry potter the famous harry potter their hero of two quidditch matches had lo st them all those points him and a couple of other stupid first yearsfrom being one of the most popular and admired people at the school harry was suddenly the most hated even ravenclaws and hufflepuffs turned on him because everyone had been longing to see slytherin lose the house cup everywhere harry went people pointed and didnt trouble to lower their voices as they insulted him slytherins on the other hand clapped as he walked past them whistling and cheering thanks potter we owe you oneonly ron stood by himtheyll all forget this in a few weeks fred and george have lost loads of points in all the time theyve been here and people still like themtheyve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go though have they said harry miserablywell no ron admittedit was a bit late to repair the damage but harry swore to himself not to meddle in things that werent his business from now on hed had it with sneaking around and spying he felt so ashamed of himself that he went to wood and offered to resign from the quidditch teamresign wood thundered what goodll that do how are we going to get any points back if we cant win at quidditchbut even quidditch had lost its fun the rest of the team wouldnt speak to harry during practice and if they had to speak about him they called him the seekerhermione and neville were suffering too they didnt have as bad a time as harry because they werent as wellknown but nobody would speak to them either hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class keeping her head down and working in silenceharry was almost glad that the exams werent far away all the studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery he ron and hermione kept to themselves working late into the night trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions learn charms and spells by heart memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellionsthen about a week before the exams were due to start harrys new resolution not to interfere in anything that didnt concern him was put to an unexpected test walking back from the library on his own one afternoon he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead as he drew closer he heard quirrells voiceno no not again please it sounded as though someone was threatening him harry moved closerall right all right he heard quirrell sobnext second quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening his turban he was pale and looked as though he was about to cry he strode out of sight harry didnt think quirrell had even noticed himhe waited until quirrells footsteps had disappeared then peered into the classroom it was empty but a door stood ajar at the other endharry was halfway toward it before he remembered what hed promised himself about not meddlingall the same hed have gambled twelve sorcerers stones that snape had just left the room and from what harry had just heard snape would be walking with a new spring in his step quirrell seemed to have given in at lastharry went back to the library where hermione was testing ron on astronomy harry told them what hed heardsnapes done it then said ron if quirrells told him how to break his antidark force spell theres still fluffy though said hermionemaybe snapes found out how to get past him without asking hagridsaid ron looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them i bet theres a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant threeheaded dog so what do we do harrythe light of adventure was kindling again in rons eyes but hermione answered before harry couldgo to dumbledore thats what we should have done ages ago if we try anything ourselves well be thrown out for surebut weve got no proof said harry quirrells too scared to back us up snapes only got to say he doesnt know how the troll got in at halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor who do you think theyll believe him or us its not exactly a secret we hate him dumbledorell think we made it up to get him sacked filch wouldnt help us if his life depended on it hes too friendly with snape and the more students get thrown out the better hell think and dont forget were not supposed to know about the stone or fluffy thatll take a lot of explaininghermione looked convinced but ron didntif we just do a bit of poking around no said harry flatly weve done enough poking aroundhe pulled a map of jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of its moonsthe following morning notes were delivered to harry hermione and neville at the breakfast table they were all the same your detention will take place at eleven oclock tonight meet mr filch in the entrance hallprofessor mcgonagall harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points theyd lost he half expected hermione to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost but she didnt say a word like harry she felt they deserved what theyd gotat eleven oclock that night they said goodbye to ron in the common room and went down to the entrance hall with neville filch was already there and so was malfoy harry had also forgotten that malfoy had gotten a detention toofollow me said filch lighting a lamp and leading them outsidei bet youll think twice about breaking a school rule again wont you eh he said leering at them oh yes hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask me its just a pity they let the old punishments die out hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days ive got the chains still in my office keep em well oiled in case theyre ever needed right off we go and dont think of running off now itll be worse for you if you dothey marched off across the dark grounds neville kept sniffing harry wondered what their punishment was going to be it must be something really horrible or filch wouldnt be sounding so delightedthe moon was bright but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them into darkness ahead harry could see the lighted windows of hagrids hut then they heard a distant shoutis that you filch hurry up i want ter get startedharrys heart rose if they were going to be working with hagrid it wouldnt be so bad his relief must have showed in his face because filch said i suppose you think youll be enjoying yourself with that oaf well think again boy its into the forest youre going and im much mistaken if youll all come out in one pieceat this neville let out a little moan and malfoy stopped dead in his tracksthe forest he repeated and he didnt sound quite as cool as usualwe cant go in there at night theres all sorts of things in there werewolves i heardneville clutched the sleeve of harrys robe and made a choking noisethats your problem isnt it said filch his voice cracking with glee shouldve thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble shouldnt youhagrid came striding toward them out of the dark fang at his heel he was carrying his large crossbow and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulderabou time he said i bin waitin fer half an hour already all right

fiercelyyehve done wrong an now yehve got ter pay fer itbut this is servant stuff its not for students to do i thought wed be copying lines or something if my father knew i was doing this hed tell yer

no one takin risks follow me over here a momenthe led them to the very edge of the forest holding his lamp up high he pointed down a narrow winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees a light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the forestlook there said hagrid see that stuff shinin on the ground silvery stuff thats unicorn blood theres a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat this is the second time in a week i found one dead last wednesday were gonna try an find the poor thing we might have ter put it out of its miseryand what if whatever hurt the unicorn

sparks right get yer wands out an practice now thats it an if anyone gets in trouble send up red sparks an well all come an find yeh so be careful lets gothe forest was black and silent a little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path and harry hermione and hagrid took the left path while malfoy neville and fang took the rightthey walked in silence their eyes on the ground every now and then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silverblue blood on the fallen leavesharry saw that hagrid looked very worriedcould a werewolf be killing the unicorns harry askednot fast enough said hagrid its not easy ter catch a unicorn theyre powerful magic creatures i never knew one ter be hurt beforethey walked past a mossy tree stump harry could hear running water there must be a stream somewhere close by there were still spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding pathyou all right hermione hagrid whispered don worry it cantve gone far if its this badly hurt an then well be able ter get behind that treehagrid seized harry and hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a towering oak he pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow raising it ready to fire the three of them listened something was slithering over dead leaves nearby it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground hagrid was squinting up the dark path but after a few seconds the sound faded awayi knew it he murmured theres summat in here that shouldn bea werewolf harry suggestedthat wasn no werewolf an it wasn no unicorn neither said hagrid grimly right follow me but careful nowthey walked more slowly ears straining for the faintest soundsuddenly in a clearing ahead something definitely movedwhos there hagrid called show yerself im armedand into the clearing came was it a man or a horse to the waist a man with red hair and beard but below that was a horses gleaming chestnut body with a long reddish tail harry and hermiones jaws droppedoh its you ronan

either of you do see anythin let me know wont yeh well be off thenharry and hermione followed him out of the clearing staring over their shoulders at ronan and bane until the trees blocked their viewnever said hagrid irritably try an get a straight answer out of a centaur ruddy stargazers not interested in anythin closern the moonare there many of them in here asked hermioneoh a fair few keep themselves to themselves mostly but theyre good enough about turnin up if ever i want a word theyre deep mind centaurs they know things jus don let on muchdyou think that was a centaur we heard earlier said harrydid that sound like hooves to you nah if yeh ask me that was whats bin killin the unicorns never heard anythin like it beforethey walked on through the dense dark trees harry kept looking nervously over his shoulder he had the nasty feeling they were being watched he was very glad they had hagrid and his crossbow with themthey had just passed a bend in the path when hermione grabbed hagrids armhagrid look red sparks the others are in troubleyou two wait here hagrid shouted stay on the path ill come back for yehthey heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking at each other very scared until they couldnt hear anything but the rustling of leaves around themyou dont think theyve been hurt do you whispered hermionei dont care if malfoy has but if somethings got neville its our fault hes here in the first placethe minutes dragged by their ears seemed sharper than usual harrys seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind every cracking twigwhat was going on where were the others at last a great crunching noise announced hagrids return malfoy neville and fang were with him hagrid was fuming malfoy it seemed had sneaked up behind neville and grabbed him as a joke neville had panicked and sent up the sparkswell be lucky ter catch anythin now with the racket you two were makin right were changin groups neville you stay with me an hermione harry you go with fang an this idiot im sorry hagrid added in a whisper to harry but hell have a harder time frightenin you an weve gotta get this doneso harry set off into the heart of the forest with malfoy and fang they walked for nearly half an hour deeper and deeper into the forest until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker there were splashes on the roots of a tree as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by harry could see a clearing ahead through the tangled branches of an ancient oaklook he murmured holding out his arm to stop malfoysomething bright white was gleaming on the ground they inched closerit was the unicorn all right and it was dead harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad its long slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearlywhite on the dark leavesharry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood a bush on the edge of the clearing quiveredthen out of the shadows a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast harry malfoy and fang stood transfixed the cloaked figure reached the unicorn lowered its head over the wound in the animals side and began to drink its bloodaaaaaaaaaarghmalfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted so did fang the hooded figure raised its head and looked right at harry unicorn blood was dribbling down its front it got to its feet and came swiftly toward harry he couldnt move for fearthen a pain like hed never felt before pierced his head it was as though his scar were on fire half blinded he staggered backward he heard hooves behind him galloping and something jumped clean over harry charging at the figurethe pain in harrys head was so bad he fell to his knees it took a minute or two to pass when he looked up the figure had gone a centaur was standing over him not ronan or bane this one looked younger he had whiteblond hair and a palomino bodyare you all right said the centaur pulling harry to his feetyes thank you what was thatthe centaur didnt answer he had astonishingly blue eyes like pale sapphires he looked carefully at harry his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out livid on harrys foreheadyou are the potter boy he said you had better get back to hagridthe forest is not safe at this time especially for you can you ride it will be quicker this waymy name is firenze he added as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that harry could clamber onto his backthere was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing ronan and bane came bursting through the trees their flanks heaving and sweatyfirenze bane thundered what are you doing you have a human on your back have you no shame are you a common muledo you realize who this is said firenze this is the potter boy the quicker he leaves this forest the betterwhat have you been telling him growled bane remember firenze we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planetsronan pawed the ground nervously im sure firenze thought he was acting for the best he said in his gloomy voicebane kicked his back legs in angerfor the best what is that to do with us centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold it is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forestfirenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger so that harry had to grab his shoulders to stay ondo you not see that unicorn firenze bellowed at bane do you not understand why it was killed or have the planets not let you in on that secret i set myself against what is lurking in this forest bane yes with humans alongside me if i mustand firenze whisked around with harry clutching on as best he could they plunged off into the trees leaving ronan and bane behind themharry didnt have a clue what was going onwhys bane so angry he asked what was that thing you saved me from anywayfirenze slowed to a walk warned harry to keep his head bowed in case of lowhanging branches but did not answer harrys question they made their way through the trees in silence for so long that harry thought firenze didnt want to talk to him anymore they were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees however when firenze suddenly stoppedharry potter do you know what unicorn blood is used forno said harry startled by the odd question weve only used the horn and tail hair in potionsthat is because it is a monstrous thing to slay a unicorn said firenze only one who has nothing to lose and everything to gain would commit such a crime the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death but at a terrible price you have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself and you will have but a halflife a cursed life from the moment the blood touches your lipsharry stared at the back of firenzes head which was dappled silver in the moonlightbut whod be that desperate he wondered aloud if youre going to be cursed forever deaths better isnt itit is firenze agreed unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else something that will bring you back to full strength and power something that will mean you can never diemr potter do you know what is hidden in the school at this very momentthe sorcerers stone of course the elixir of life but i dont understand who can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power who has clung to life awaiting their chanceit was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around harrys heart over the rustling of the trees he seemed to hear once more what hagrid had told him on the night they had met some say he diedcodswallop in my opinion dunno if he had enough human left in him to diedo you mean harry croaked that was volharry harry are you all righthermione was running toward them down the path hagrid puffing along behind herim fine said harry hardly knowing what he was saying the unicorns dead hagrid its in that clearing back therethis is where i leave you firenze murmured as hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn you are safe nowharry slid off his backgood luck harry potter said firenze the planets have been read wrongly before now even by centaurs i hope this is one of those timeshe turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest leaving harry shivering behind himron had fallen asleep in the dark common room waiting for them to return he shouted something about quidditch fouls when harry roughly shook him awake in a matter of seconds though he was wideeyed as harry began to tell him and hermione what had happened in the forestharry couldnt sit down he paced up and down in front of the fire he was still shakingsnape wants the stone for voldemort and voldemorts waiting in the forest and all this time we thought snape just wanted to get richstop saying the name said ron in a terrified whisper as if he thought voldemort could hear themharry wasnt listeningfirenze saved me but he shouldnt have done so bane was furioushe was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen they must show that voldemorts coming back bane thinks firenze should have let voldemort kill me i suppose thats written in the stars as wellwill you stop saying the name ron hissedso all ive got to wait for now is snape to steal the stone harry went on feverishly then voldemort will be able to come and finish me off well i suppose banell be happyhermione looked very frightened but she had a word of comfortharry everyone says dumbledores the only one youknowwho was ever afraid of with dumbledore around youknowwho wont touch you anyway who says the centaurs are right it sounds like fortunetelling to me and professor mcgonagall says thats a very imprecise branch of magicthe sky had turned light before they stopped talking they went to bed exhausted their throats sore but the nights surprises werent overwhen harry pulled back his sheets he found his invisibility cloak folded neatly underneath them there was a note pinned to it just in casechapter sixteenthrough the trapdoorin years to come harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment yet the days crept by and there could be no doubt that fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked doorit was sweltering hot especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers they had been given special new quills for the exams which had been bewitched with an anticheating spellthey had practical exams as well professor flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk professor mcgonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was but taken away if it had whiskers snape made them all nervous breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a forgetfulness potionharry did the best he could trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest neville thought harry had a bad case of exam nerves because harry couldnt sleep but the truth was that harry kept being woken by his old nightmare except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in itmaybe it was because they hadnt seen what harry had seen in the forest or because they didnt have scars burning on their foreheads but ron and hermione didnt seem as worried about the stone as harry the idea of voldemort certainly scared them but he didnt keep visiting them in dreams and they were so busy with their studying they didnt have much time to fret about what snape or anyone else might be up totheir very last exam was history of magic one hour of answering questions about batty old wizards whod invented selfstirring cauldrons and theyd be free free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out when the ghost of professor binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment harry couldnt help cheering with the restthat was far easier than i thought it would be said hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds i neednt have learned about the werewolf code of conduct or the uprising of elfric the eagerhermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward but ron said this made him feel ill so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree the weasley twins and lee jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid which was basking in the warm shallows no more studying ron sighed happily stretching out on the grass you could look more cheerful harry weve got a week before we find out how badly weve done theres no need to worry yetharry was rubbing his foreheadi wish i knew what this means he burst out angrily my scar keeps hurting its happened before but never as often as thisgo to madam pomfrey hermione suggestedim not ill said harry i think its a warning it means dangers comingron couldnt get worked up it was too hotharry relax hermiones right the stones safe as long as dumbledores around anyway weve never had any proof snape found out how to get past fluffy he nearly had his leg ripped off once hes not going to try it again in a hurry and neville will play quidditch for england before hagrid lets dumbledore downharry nodded but he couldnt shake off a lurking feeling that there was something hed forgotten to do something important when he tried to explain this hermione said thats just the exams i woke up last night and was halfway through my transfiguration notes before i remembered wed done that oneharry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didnt have anything to do with work though he watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky a note clamped in its mouth hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters hagrid would never betray dumbledorehagrid would never tell anyone how to get past fluffy never but harry suddenly jumped to his feetwherere you going said ron sleepilyive just thought of something said harry he had turned whiteweve got to go and see hagrid nowwhy panted hermione hurrying to keep updont you think its a bit odd said harry scrambling up the grassy slope that what hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket how many people wander around with dragon eggs if its against wizard law lucky they found hagrid dont you think why didnt i see it beforewhat are you talking about said ron but harry sprinting across the grounds toward the forest didnt answerhagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house his trousers and sleeves were rolled up and he was shelling peas into a large bowlhullo he said smiling finished yer exams got time fer a drinkyes please said ron but harry cut him offno were in a hurry hagrid ive got to ask you something you know that night you won norbert what did the stranger you were playing cards with look likedunno said hagrid casually he wouldn take his cloak offhe saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrowsits not that unusual yeh get a lot o funny folk in the hogs head thats the pub down in the village mighta bin a dragon dealer mightn he i never saw his face he kept his hood upharry sank down next to the bowl of peas what did you talk to him about hagrid did you mention hogwarts at allmighta come up said hagrid frowning as he tried to rememberyeah he asked what i did an i told him i was gamekeeper herehe asked a bit about the sorta creatures i took after so i told him an i said what id always really wanted was a dragon an then i can remember too well cause he kept buyin me drinkslets see yeah then he said he had the dragon egg an we could play cards fer it if i wanted but he had ter be sure i could handle it he didn want it ter go ter any old home so i told him after fluffy a dragon would be easyand did he did he seem interested in fluffy harry asked try ing to keep his voice calmwell yeah how many threeheaded dogs dyeh

told yeh that he blurted out forget i said it hey wherere yeh goinharry ron and hermione didnt speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall which seemed very cold and gloomy after the groundsweve got to go to dumbledore said harry hagrid told that stranger how to get past fluffy and it was either snape or voldemort under that cloak it mustve been easy once hed got hagrid drunk i just hope dumbledore believes us firenze might back us up if bane doesnt stop him wheres dumbledores officethey looked around as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction they had never been told where dumbledore lived nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see himwell just have to harry began but a voice suddenly rang across the hallwhat are you three doing insideit was professor mcgonagall carrying a large pile of bookswe want to see professor dumbledore said hermione rather bravely harry and ron thoughtsee professor dumbledore professor mcgonagall repeated as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do whyharry swallowed now what its sort of secret he said but he wished at once he hadnt because professor mcgonagalls nostrils flaredprofessor dumbledore left ten minutes ago she said coldly he received an urgent owl from the ministry of magic and flew off for london at oncehes gone said harry frantically nowprofessor dumbledore is a very great wizard potter he has many demands on his time but this is importantsomething you have to say is more important than the ministry of magic potterlook said harry throwing caution to the winds professor its about the sorcerers tone whatever professor mcgonagall had expected it wasnt that the books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms but she didnt pick them uphow do you know she splutteredprofessor i think i know that sn that someones going to try and steal the stone ive got to talk to professor dumbledoreshe eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicionprofessor dumbledore will be back tomorrow she said finally i dont know how you found out about the stone but rest assured no one can possibly steal it its too well protectedbut professor potter i know what im talking about she said shortly she bent down and gathered up the fallen books i suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshinebut they didntits tonight said harry once he was sure professor mcgonagall was out of earshot snapes going through the trapdoor tonight hes found out everything he needs and now hes got dumbledore out of the way he sent that note i bet the ministry of magic will get a real shock when dumbledore turns upbut what can we hermione gasped harry and ron wheeled roundsnape was standing theregood afternoon he said smoothlythey stared at himyou shouldnt be inside on a day like this he said with an odd twisted smilewe were harry began without any idea what he was going to sayyou want to be more careful said snape hanging around like this people will think youre up to something and gryffindor really cant afford to lose any more points can itharry flushed they turned to go outside but snape called them backbe warned potter any more nighttime wanderings and i will personally make sure you are expelled good day to youhe strode off in the direction of the staffroomout on the stone steps harry turned to the othersright heres what weve got to do he whispered urgently one of us has got to keep an eye on snape wait outside the staff room and follow him if he leaves it hermione youd better do thatwhy meits obvious said ron you can pretend to be waiting for professor flitwick you know he put on a high voice oh professor flitwick im so worried i think i got question fourteen b wrongÃ¢â‚¬Å“oh shut up said hermione but she agreed to go and watch out for snapeand wed better stay outside the thirdfloor corridor harry told roncome onbut that part of the plan didnt work no sooner had they reached the door separating fluffy from the rest of the school than professor mcgonagall turned up again and this time she lost her temperi suppose you think youre harder to get past than a pack of enchantments she stormed enough of this nonsense if i hear you ve come anywhere near here again ill take another fifty points from gryffindor yes weasley from my own house harry and ron went back to the common room harry had just said at least hermiones on snapes tail when the portrait of the fat lady swung open and hermione came inim sorry harry she wailed snape came out and asked me what i was doing so i said i was waiting for flitwick and snape went to get him and ive only just got away i dont know where snape wentwell thats it then isnt it harry saidthe other two stared at him he was pale and his eyes were glitteringim going out of here tonight and im going to try and get to the stone firstyoure mad said ronyou cant said hermione after what mcgonagall and snape have said youll be expelledso whap harry shouted dont you understand if snape gets hold of the stone voldemorts coming back havent you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over there wont be any hogwarts to get expelled from hell flatten it or turn it into a school for the dark arts losing points doesnt matter anymore cant you see dyou think hell leave you and your families alone if gryffindor wins the house cup if i get caught before i can get to the stone well ill have to go back to the dursleys and wait for voldemort to find me there its only dying a bit later than i would have because im never going over to the dark side im going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me voldemort killed my parents rememberhe glared at themyoure right harry said hermione in a small voiceill use the invisibility cloak said harry its just lucky i got it backbut will it cover all three of us said ronall all three of usoh come off it you dont think wed let you go aloneof course not said hermione briskly how do you think youd get to the stone without us id better go and took through my books there might be something usefulbut if we get caught you two will be expelled toonot if i can help it said hermione grimly flitwick told me in secret that i got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam theyre not throwing me out after thatafter dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common roomnobody bothered them none of the gryffindors had anything to say to harry any more after all this was the first night he hadnt been upset by it hermione was skimming through all her notes hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break harry and ron didnt talk much both of them were thinking about what they were about to doslowly the room emptied as people drifted off to bedbetter get the cloak ron muttered as lee jordan finally left stretching and yawning harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory he putted out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute hagrid had given him for christmas he pocketed it to use on fluffy he didnt feel much like singinghe ran back down to the common roomwed better put the cloak on here and make sure it covers all three of us if filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own what are you doing said a voice from the corner of the room neville appeared from behind an armchair clutching trevor the toad who looked as though hed been making another bid for freedomnothing neville nothing said harry hurriedly putting the cloak behind his backneville stared at their guilty facesyoure going out again he saidno no no said hermione no were not why dont you go to bed nevilleharry looked at the grandfather clock by the door they couldnt afford to waste any more time snape might even now be playing fluffy to sleepyou cant go out said neville youll be caught again gryffindor will be in even more troubleyou dont understand said harry this is importantbut neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperatei wont let you do it he said hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole ill ill fight youneville ron exploded get away from that hole and dont be an idiot dont you call me an idiot said neville i dont think you should be breaking any more rules and you were the one who told me to stand up to peopleyes but not to us said ron in exasperation neville you dont know what youre doinghe took a step forward and neville dropped trevor the toad who leapt out of sightgo on then try and hit me said neville raising his fists im readyharry turned to hermionedo something he said desperatelyhermione stepped forwardneville she said im really really sorry about thisshe raised her wandpetrificus totalus she cried pointing it at nevillenevilles arms snapped to his sides his legs sprang together his whole body rigid he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face stiff as a boardhermione ran to turn him over nevilles jaws were jammed together so he couldnt speak only his eyes were moving looking at them in horrorwhatve you done to him harry whisperedits the full bodybind said hermione miserably oh neville im so sorrywe had to neville no time to explain said harryyoull understand later neville said ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the invisibility cloakbut leaving neville lying motionless on the floor didnt feel like a very good omen in their nervous state every statues shadow looked like filch every distant breath of wind sounded like peeves swooping down on them at the foot of the first set of stairs they spotted mrs norris skulking near the topoh lets kick her just this once ron whispered in harrys ear but harry shook his head as they climbed carefully around her mrs norris turned her lamplike eyes on them but didnt do anythingthey didnt meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the third floor peeves was bobbing halfway up loosening the carpet so that people would tripwhos there he said suddenly as they climbed toward him he narrowed his wicked black eyes know youre there even if i cant see you are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastiehe rose up in the air and floated there squinting at themshould call filch i should if somethings acreeping around unseenharry had a sudden ideapeeves he said in a hoarse whisper the bloody baron has his own reasons for being invisiblepeeves almost fell out of the air in shock he caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the stairsso sorry your bloodiness mr baron sir he said greasily my mistake my mistake i didnt see you of course i didnt youre invisible forgive old peevsie his little joke siri have business here peeves croaked harry stay away from this place tonighti will sir i most certainly will said peeves rising up in the air again hope your business goes well baron ill not bother youand he scooted off brilliant harry whispered rona few seconds later they were there outside the thirdfloor corridor and the door was already ajarwell there you are harry said quietly snapes already got past fluffyseeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them underneath the cloak harry turned to the other twoif you want to go back i wont blame you he said you can take the cloak i wont need it nowdont be stupid said ronwere coming said hermioneharry pushed the door openas the door creaked low rumbling growls met their ears all three of the dogs noses sniffed madly in their direction even though it couldnt see themwhats that at its feet hermione whisperedlooks like a harp said ron snape must have left it thereit must wake up the moment you stop playing said harry well here goeshe put hagrids flute to his lips and blew it wasnt really a tune but from the first note the beasts eyes began to droop harry hardly drew breath slowly the dogs growls ceased it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees then it slumped to the ground fast asleepkeep playing ron warned harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor they could feel the dogs hot smelly breath as they approached the giant heads i think well be able to pull the door open said ron peering over the dogs back want to go first hermioneno i dontall right ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dogs legs he bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor which swung up and openwhat can you see hermione said anxiouslynothing just black theres no way of climbing down well just have to dropharry who was still playing the flute waved at ron to get his attention and pointed at himselfyou want to go first are you sure said ron i dont know how deep this thing goes give the flute to hermione so she can keep him asleepharry handed the flute over in the few seconds silence the dog growled and twitched but the moment hermione began to play it fell back into its deep sleepharry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor there was no sign of the bottomhe lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips then he looked up at ron and said if anything happens to me dont follow go straight to the owlery and send hedwig to dumbledore rightright said ronsee you in a minute i hopeand harry let go cold damp air rushed past him as he fell down down down and flump with a funny muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft he sat up and felt around his eyes not used to the gloom it felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plantits okay he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp which was the open trapdoor its a soft landing you can jumpron followed right away he landed sprawled next to harrywhats this stuff were his first wordsdunno some sort of plant thing i suppose its here to break the fallcome on hermionethe distant music stopped there was a loud bark from the dog but hermione had already jumped she landed on harrys other sidewe must be miles under the school she saidlucky this plant things here really said ronlucky shrieked hermione look at you bothshe leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall she had to struggle because the moment she had landed the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles as for harry and ron their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticinghermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them but the more they strained against it the tighter and faster the plant wound around themstop moving hermione ordered them i know what this is its devils snareoh im so glad we know what its called thats a great help snarled ron leaning back trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck shut up im trying to remember how to kill it said hermionewell hurry up i cant breathe harry gasped wrestling with it as it curled around his chestdevils snare devils snare what did professor sprout say it likes the dark and the damp so light a fire harry chokedyes of course but theres no wood hermione cried wringing her handshave you gone mad ron bellowed are you a witch or notoh right said hermione and she whipped out her wand waved it muttered something and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on snape at the plant in a matter of seconds the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmthwriggling and flailing it unraveled itself from their bodies and they were able to pull freelucky you pay attention in herbology hermione said harry as he joined her by the wall wiping sweat off his faceyeah said ron and lucky harry doesnt lose his head in a crisis theres no wood honestlythis way said harry pointing down a stone passageway which was the only way forwardall they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls the passageway sloped downward and harry was reminded of gringotts with an unpleasant jolt of the heart he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards bank if they met a dragon a fullygrown dragon norbert had been bad enoughcan you hear something ron whisperedharry listened a soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up aheaddo you think its a ghosti dont know sounds like wings to metheres light ahead i can see something movingthey reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber its ceiling arching high above them it was full of small jewelbright birds fluttering and tumbling all around the room on the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden doordo you think theyll attack us if we cross the room said ronprobably said harry they dont look very vicious but i suppose if they all swooped down at once well theres no other choice ill runhe took a deep breath covered his face with his arms and sprinted across the room he expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second but nothing happened he reached the door untouched he pulled the handle but it was lockedthe other two followed him they tugged and heaved at the door but it wouldnt budge not even when hermione tried her alohomora charmnow what said ronthese birds they cant be here just for decoration said hermionethey watched the birds soaring overhead glittering glittering theyre not birds harry said suddenly theyre keys winged keys look carefully so that must mean he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys yes look broomsticks weve got to catch the key to the doorbut there are hundreds of themron examined the lock on the doorwere looking for a big oldfashioned one probably silver like the handlethey each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys they grabbed and snatched but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch onenot for nothing though was harry the youngest seeker in a century he had a knack for spotting things other people didnt after a minutes weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyholethat one he called to the others that big one there no there with bright blue wings the feathers are all crumpled on one sideron went speeding in the direction that harry was pointing crashed into the ceiling and nearly fell off his broomweve got to close in on it harry called not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing ron you come at it from above hermione stay below and stop it from going down and ill try and catch it right nowron dived hermione rocketed upward the key dodged them both and harry streaked after it it sped toward the wall harry leaned forward and with a nasty crunching noise pinned it against the stone with one hand ron and hermiones cheers echoed around the high chamberthey landed quickly and harry ran to the door the key struggling in his hand he rammed it into the lock and turned it worked the moment the lock had clicked open the key took flight again looking very battered now that it had been caught twiceready harry asked the other two his hand on the door handle they nodded he pulled the door openthe next chamber was so dark they couldnt see anything at all but as they stepped into it light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sightthey were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard behind the black chessmen which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone facing them way across the chamber were the white pieces harry ron and hermione shivered slightly the towering white chessmen had no facesnow what do we do harry whisperedits obvious isnt it said ron weve got to play our way across the roombehind the white pieces they could see another doorhow said hermione nervouslyi think said ron were going to have to be chessmenhe walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knights horse at once the stone sprang to life the horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at rondo we er have to join you to get across the black knight nodded ron turned to the other twothis needs thinking about he said i suppose weve got to take the place of three of the black piecesharry and hermione stayed quiet watching ron think finally he said now dont be offended or anything but neither of you are that good at chess were not offended said harry quickly just tell us what to dowell harry you take the place of that bishop and hermione you next to him instead of that castlewhat about youim going to be a knight said ronthe chessmen seemed to have been listening because at these words a knight a bishop and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board leaving three empty squares that harry ron and hermione tookwhite always plays first in chess said ron peering across the boardyes looka white pawn had moved forward two squaresron started to direct the black pieces they moved silently wherever he sent them harrys knees were trembling what if they lost harry move diagonally four squares to the righttheir first real shock came when their other knight was taken the white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board where he lay quite still facedownhad to let that happen said ron looking shaken leaves you free to take that bishop hermione go onevery time one of their men was lost the white pieces showed no mercysoon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the walltwice ron only just noticed in time that harry and hermione were in danger he himself darted around the board taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black oneswere nearly there he muttered suddenly let me think let me thinkthe white queen turned her blank face toward himyes said ron softly its the only way ive got to be takennof harry and hermione shoutedthats chess snapped ron youve got to make some sacrifices i take one step forward and shell take me that leaves you free to checkmate the king harrybut do you want to stop snape or notron look if you dont hurry up hell already have the stonethere was no alternativeready ron called his face pale but determined here i go now dont hang around once youve wonhe stepped forward and the white queen pounced she struck ron hard across the head with her stone arm and he crashed to the floor hermione screamed but stayed on her square the white queen dragged ron to one side he looked as if hed been knocked outshaking harry moved three spaces to the leftthe white king took off his crown and threw it at harrys feet they had won the chessmen parted and bowed leaving the door ahead clear with one last desperate look back at ron harry and hermione charged through the door and up the next passagewaywhat if hes hell be all right said harry trying to convince himself what do you reckons nextweve had sprouts that was the devils snare flitwick mustve put charms on the keys mcgonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive that leaves quirrells spell and snapesthey had reached another doorall right harry whisperedgo onharry pushed it opena disgusting smell filled their nostrils making both of them pull their robes up over their noses eyes watering they saw flat on the floor in front of them a troll even larger than the one they had tackled out cold with a bloody lump on its headim glad we didnt have to fight that one harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs come on i cant breathehe pulled open the next door both of them hardly daring to look at what came next but there was nothing very frightening in here just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a linesnapes said harry what do we have to dothey stepped over the threshold and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway it wasnt ordinary fire either it was purple at the same instant black flames shot up in the doorway leading onwardthey were trappedlook hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles harry looked over her shoulder to read it danger lies before you while safety lies behind two of us will help you which ever you would find one among us seven will let you move ahead another will transport the drinker back instead two among our number hold only nettle wine three of us are killers waiting bidden in linechoose unless you wish to stay here forevermore to help you in your choice we give you these clues four first however slyly the poison tries to hide you will always find some on nettle wines left side second different are those who stand at either end but if you would move onward neither is your friend third as you see clearly all are different size neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides fourth the second left and the second on the right are twins once you taste them though different at first sighthermione let out a great sigh and harry amazed saw that she was smiling the very last thing he felt like doingbrilliant said hermione this isnt magic its logic a puzzlea lot of the greatest wizards havent got an ounce of logic theyd be stuck in here foreverbut so will we wont we of course not said hermione everything we need is here on this paper seven bottles three are poison two are wine one will get us safely through the black fire and one will get us back through the purplebut how do we know which to drinkgive me a minutehermione read the paper several times then she walked up and down the line of bottles muttering to herself and pointing at them at last she clapped her handsgot it she said the smallest bottle will get us through the black fire toward the stoneharry looked at the tiny bottletheres only enough there for one of us he said thats hardly one swallowthey looked at each otherwhich one will get you back through the purple flameshermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the lineyou drink that said harry no listen get back and get ron grab brooms from the flying key room theyll get you out of the trapdoor and past fluffy go straight to the owlery and send hedwig to dumbledore we need him i might be able to hold snape off for a while but im no match for him reallybut harry what if youknowwhos with himwell i was lucky once wasnt i said harry pointing at his scari might get lucky againhermiones lip trembled and she suddenly dashed at harry and threw her arms around himhermioneharry youre a great wizard you knowim not as good as you said harry very embarrassed as she let go of himme said hermione books and cleverness there are more important things friendship and bravery and oh harry be carefulyou drink first said harry you are sure which is which arent youpositive said hermione she took a long drink from the round bottle at the end and shudderedits not poison said harry anxiouslyno but its like icequick go before it wears offgood luck take caregohermione turned and walked straight through the purple fireharry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle he turned to face the black flameshere i come he said and he drained the little bottle in one gulpit was indeed as though ice was flooding his body he put the bottle down and walked forward he braced himself saw the black flames licking his body but couldnt feel them for a moment he could see nothing but dark fire then he was on the other side in the last chamberthere was already someone there but it wasnt snape it wasnt even voldemortchapter seventeenthe man with two faces it was quirrellyou gasped harryquirrell smiled his face wasnt twitching at allme he said calmly i wondered whether id be meeting you here potterbut i thought snape severus quirrell laughed and it wasnt his usual quivering treble either but cold and sharp yes severus does seem the type doesnt he so useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat next to him who would suspect pppoor ststuttering pprofessor quirrellharry couldnt take it in this couldnt be true it couldntbut snape tried to kill meno no no i tried to kill you your friend miss granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to snape at that quidditch match she broke my eye contact with you another few seconds and id have got you off that broom id have managed it before then if snape hadnt been muttering a countercurse trying to save yousnape was trying to save meof course said quirrell coolly \why do you think he wanted to referee your next match he was trying to make sure i didnt do it again funny really he neednt have bothered i couldnt do anything with dumbledore watching all the other teachers thought snape was trying to stop gryffindor from winning he did make himself unpopularand what a waste of time when after all that im going to kill you tonightquirrell snapped his fingers ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around harryyoure too nosy to live potter scurrying around the school on halloween like that for all i knew youd seen me coming to look at what was guarding the stoneyou let the troll incertainly i have a special gift with trolls you must have seen what i did to the one in the chamber back there unfortunately while everyone else was running around looking for it snape who already suspected me went straight to the third floor to head me off and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death that threeheaded dog didnt even manage to bite snapes leg off properlynow wait quietly potter i need to examine this interesting mirrorit was only then that harry realized what was standing behind quirrellit was the mirror of erisedthis mirror is the key to finding the stone quirrell murmured tapping his way around the frame trust dumbledore to come up with something like this but hes in london ill be far away by the time he gets backall harry could think of doing was to keep quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirrori saw you and snape in the forest he blurted outyes said quirrell idly walking around the mirror to look at the back he was on to me by that time trying to find out how far id gothe suspected me all along tried to frighten me as though he could when i had lord voldemort on my sidequirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into iti see the stone im presenting it to my master but where is itharry struggled against the ropes binding him but they didnt give he had to keep quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirrorbut snape always seemed to hate me so muchoh he does said quirrell casually heavens yes he was at hogwarts with your father didnt you know they loathed each other but he never wanted you deadbut i heard you a few days ago sobbing i thought snape was threatening youfor the first time a spasm of fear flitted across quirrells facesometimes he said i find it hard to follow my masters instructions he is a great wizard and i am weak you mean he was there in the classroom with you harry gaspedhe is with me wherever i go said quirrell quietly i met him when i traveled around the world a foolish young man i was then full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil lord voldemort showed me how wrong i was there is no good and evil there is only power and those too weak to seek it since then i have served him faithfully although i have let him down many times he has had to be very hard on mequirrell shivered suddenly he does not forgive mistakes easily when i failed to steal the stone from gringotts he was most displeased he punished me decided he would have to keep a closer watch on mequirrells voice trailed away harry was remembering his trip to diagon alley how could he have been so stupid hed seen quirrell there that very day shaken hands with him in the leaky cauldronquirrell cursed under his breathi dont understand is the stone inside the mirror should i break itharrys mind was racingwhat i want more than anything else in the world at the moment he thought is to find the stone before quirrell does so if i look in the mirror i should see myseff finding it which means ill see where its hidden but how can i look without quirrell realizing what im up to he tried to edge to the left to get in front of the glass without quirrell noticing but the ropes around his ankles were too tight he tripped and fell over quirrell ignored him he was still talking to himself what does this mirror do how does it work help me masterand to harrys horror a voice answered and the voice seemed to come from quirrell himself use the boy use the boyquirrell rounded on harryyes potter come herehe clapped his hands once and the ropes binding harry fell off harry got slowly to his feetcome here quirrell repeated look in the mirror and tell me what you seeharry walked toward himi must lie he thought desperately i must look and lie about what i see thats allquirrell moved close behind him harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from quirrells turban he closed his eyes stepped in front of the mirror and opened them againhe saw his reflection pale and scaredlooking at first but a moment later the reflection smiled at him it put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a bloodred stone it winked and put the stone back in its pocket and as it did so harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket somehow incredibly hed gotten the stonewell said quirrell impatiently what do you seeharry screwed up his couragei see myself shaking hands with dumbledore he invented i ive won the house cup for gryffindorquirrell cursed againget out of the way he said as harry moved aside he felt the sorcerers stone against his leg dare he make a break for it but he hadnt walked five paces before a high voice spoke though quirrell wasnt moving his lipshe lies he liespotter come back here quirrell shouted tell me the truth what did you just seethe high voice spoke againlet me speak to him facetofacemaster you are not strong enoughi have strength enough for thisharry felt as if devils snare was rooting him to the spot he couldnt move a muscle petrified he watched as quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban what was going on the turban fell away quirrells head looked strangely small without it then he turned slowly on the spotharry would have screamed but he couldnt make a sound where there should have been a back to quirrells head there was a face the most terrible face harry had ever seen it was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils like a snakeharry potter it whisperedharry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldnt movesee what i have become the face said mere shadow and vapor i have form only when i can share anothers body but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds unicorn blood has strengthened me these past weeks you saw faithful quirrell drinking it for me in the forest and once i have the elixir of life i will be able to create a body of my own now why dont you give me that stone in your pocketso he knew the feeling suddenly surged back into harrys legs he stumbled backwarddont be a fool snarled the face better save your own life and join me or youll meet the same end as your parents they died begging me for mercyliar harry shouted suddenlyquirrell was walking backward at him so that voldemort could still see him the evil face was now smilinghow touching it hissed i always value bravery yes boy your parents were brave i killed your father first and he put up a courageous fight but your mother neednt have died she was trying to protect you now give me the stone unless you want her to have died in vainneverharry sprang toward the flame door but voldemort screamed seize himand the next second harry felt quirrells hand close on his wrist at once a needlesharp pain seared across harrys scar his head felt as though it was about to split in two he yelled struggling with all his might and to his surprise quirrell let go of him the pain in his head lessened he looked around wildly to see where quirrell had gone and saw him hunched in pain looking at his fingers they were blistering before his eyesseize him seize him shrieked voldemort again and quirrell lunged knocking harry clean off his feet landing on top of him both hands around harrys neck harrys scar was almost blinding him with pain yet he could see quirrell howling in agonymaster i cannot hold him my hands my handsand quirrell though pinning harry to the ground with his knees let go of his neck and stared bewildered at his own palms harry could see they looked burned raw red and shinythen kill him fool and be done screeched voldemortquirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse but harry by instinct reached up and grabbed quirrells face aaaarghquirrell rolled off him his face blistering too and then harry knew quirrell couldnt touch his bare skin not without suffering terrible pain his only chance was to keep hold of quirrell keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curseharry jumped to his feet caught quirrell by the arm and hung on as tight as he could quirrell screamed and tried to throw harry off the pain in harrys head was building he couldnt see he could only hear quirrells terrible shrieks and voldemorts yells of kill him kill him and other voices maybe in harrys own head crying harry harryhe felt quirrells arm wrenched from his grasp knew all was lost and fell into blackness down down downsomething gold was glinting just above him the snitch he tried to catch it but his arms were too heavyhe blinked it wasnt the snitch at all it was a pair of glasses how strangehe blinked again the smiling face of albus dumbledore swam into view above himgood afternoon harry said dumbledore harry stared at him then he remembered sir the stone it was quirrell hes got the stone sir quick calm yourself dear boy you are a little behind the times said dumbledore quirrell does not have the stonethen who does sir i harry please relax or madam pomfrey will have me thrown outharry swallowed and looked around him he realized he must be in the hospital wing he was lying in a bed with white linen sheets and next to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shoptokens from your friends and admirers said dumbledore beaming what happened down in the dungeons between you and professor quirrell is a complete secret so naturally the whole school knows i believe your friends misters fred and george weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat no doubt they thought it would amuse you madam pomfrey however felt it might not be very hygienic and confiscated ithow long have i been in herethree days mr ronald weasley and miss granger will be most relieved you have come round they have been extremely worriedbut sit the stone i see you are not to be distracted very well the stone professor quirrell did not manage to take it from you i arrived in time to prevent that although you were doing very well on your own i must sayyou got there you got hermiones owlwe must have crossed in midair no sooner had i reached london than it became clear to me that the place i should be was the one i had just left i arrived just in time to pull quirrell off youit was youi feared i might be too lateyou nearly were i couldnt have kept him off the stone much longer not the stone boy you the effort involved nearly killed you for one terrible moment there i was afraid it had as for the stone it has been destroyeddestroyed said harry blankly but your friend nicolas flamel oh you know about nicolas said dumbledore sounding quite delightedyou did do the thing properly didnt you well nicolas and i have had a little chat and agreed its all for the bestbut that means he and his wife will die wont theythey have enough elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then yes they will diedumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on harrys faceto one as young as you im sure it seems incredible but to nicolas and perenelle it really is like going to bed after a very very long day after all to the wellorganized mind death is but the next great adventure you know the stone was really not such a wonderful thing as much money and life as you could want the two things most human beings would choose above all the trouble is humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them harry lay there lost for words dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceilingsir said harry ive been thinking sir even if the stones gone vol i mean youknow who call him voldemort harry always use the proper name for things fear of a name increases fear of the thing itselfyes sir well voldemorts going to try other ways of coming back isnt he i mean he hasnt gone has heno harry he has not he is still out there somewhere perhaps looking for another body to share not being truly alive he cannot be killedhe left quirrell to die he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies nevertheless harry while you may only have delayed his return to power it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time and if he is delayed again and again why he may never return to powerharry nodded but stopped quickly because it made his head hurt then he said sir there are some other things id like to know if you can tell me things i want to know the truth aboutthe truth dumbledore sighed it is a beautiful and terrible thing and should therefore be treated with great caution however i shall answer your questions unless i have a very good reason not to in which case i beg youll forgive me i shall not of course liewell voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me but why would he want to kill me in the first placedumbledore sighed very deeply this timealas the first thing you ask me i cannot tell you not today not now you will know one day put it from your mind for now harrywhen you are older i know you hate to hear this when you are ready you will knowand harry knew it would be no good to arguebut why couldnt quirrell touch meyour mother died to save you if there is one thing voldemort cannot understand it is love he didnt realize that love as powerful as your mothers for you leaves its own mark not a scar no visible sign to have been loved so deeply even though the person who loved us is gone will give us some protection forever it is in your very skin quirrell full of hatred greed and ambition sharing his soul with voldemort could not touch you for this reason it was agony to touch a person marked by something so gooddumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill which gave harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet when he had found his voice again harry said and the invisibility cloak do you know who sent it to meah your father happened to leave it in my possession and i thought you might like it dumbledores eyes twinkled useful things your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was hereand theres something elsefire awayquirrell said snape professor snape harry yes him quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father is that truewell they did rather detest each other not unlike yourself and mr malfoy and then your father did something snape could never forgivewhathe saved his lifewhatyes said dumbledore dreamily funny the way peoples minds work isnt it professor snape couldnt bear being in your fathers debti do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even then he could go back to hating your fathers memory in peaceharry tried to understand this but it made his head pound so he stoppedand sir theres one more thingjust the onehow did i get the stone out of the mirrorah now im glad you asked me that it was one of my more brilliant ideas and between you and me thats saying something you see only one who wanted to find the stone find it but not use it would be able to get it otherwise theyd just see themselves making gold or drinking elixir of life my brain surprises even me sometimes now enough questions i suggest you make a start on these sweets ah bettie botts every flavor beans i was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomitflavored one and since then im afraid ive rather lost my liking for them but i think ill be safe with a nice toffee dont youhe smiled and popped the goldenbrown bean into his mouth then he choked and said alas ear waxmadam pomfrey the nurse was a nice woman but very strictjust five minutes harry pleadedabsolutely notyou let professor dumbledore inwell of course that was the headmaster quite different you need resti am resting look lying down and everything oh go on madam pomfreyoh very well she said but five minutes onlyand she let ron and hermione inharryhermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again but harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very soreoh harry we were sure you were going to dumbledore was so worried the whole schools talking about it said ron what really happenedit was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumors harry told them everything quirrell the mirror the stone and voldemort ron and hermione were a very good audience they gasped in all the right places and when harry told them what was under quirrells turban hermione screamed out loudso the stones gone said ron finally flamels just going to diethats what i said but dumbledore thinks that what was it to the wellorganized mind death is but the next great adventurei always said he was off his rocker said ron looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero wasso what happened to you two said harrywell i got back all right said hermione i brought ron round that took a while and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall he already knew he just said harrys gone after him hasnt he and hurtled off to the third floordyou think he meant you to do it said ron sending you your fathers cloak and everythingwell hermione exploded if he did i mean to say thats terrible you could have been killedno it isnt said harry thoughtfully hes a funny man dumbledorei think he sort of wanted to give me a chance i think he knows more or less everything that goes on here you know i reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try and instead of stopping us he just taught us enough to help i dont think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked its almost like he thought i had the right to face voldemort if i couldyeah dumbledores off his rocker all right said ron proudlylisten youve got to be up for the endofyear feast tomorrow the points are all in and slytherin won of course you missed the last quidditch match we were steamrollered by ravenclaw without you but the foodll be goodat that moment madam pomfrey bustled overyouve had nearly fifteen minutes now out she said firmlyafter a good nights sleep harry felt nearly back to normali want to go to the feast he told madam pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes i can cant iprofessor dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go she said stiffily as though in her opinion professor dumbledore didnt realize how risky feasts could be and you have another visitoroh good said harry who is ithagrid sidled through the door as he spoke as usual when he was indoors hagrid looked too big to be allowed he sat down next to harry took one look at him and burst into tearsits all my ruddy fault he sobbed his face in his handsi told the evil git how ter get past fluffy i told him it was the only thing he didnt know an i told him yeh couldve died all fer a dragon egg ill never drink again i should be chucked out an made ter live as a mugglehagrid said harry shocked to see hagrid shaking with grief and remorse great tears leaking down into his beard hagrid hed have found out somehow this is voldemort were talking about hed have found out even if you hadnt told himyeh couldve died sobbed hagrid an don say the namevoldemort harry bellowed and hagrid was so shocked he stopped crying ive met him and im calling him by his name please cheer up hagrid we saved the stone its gone he cant use it have a chocolate frog ive got loadshagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said that reminds me ive got yeh a presentits not a stoat sandwich is it said harry anxiously and at last hagrid gave a weak chuckle nah dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it course he shoulda sacked me instead anyway got yeh thisit seemed to be a handsome leathercovered book harry opened it curiously it was full of wizard photographs smiling and waving at him from every page were his mother and fathersent owls off ter all yer parents old school friends askin fer photos knew yeh didn have any dyeh like itharry couldnt speak but hagrid understoodharry made his way down to the endofyear feast alone that night he had been held up by madam pomfreys fussing about insisting on giving him one last checkup so the great hall was already full it was decked out in the slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate slytherins winning the house cup for the seventh year in a row a huge banner showing the slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the high tablewhen harry walked in there was a sudden hush and then everybody started talking loudly at once he slipped into a seat between ron and hermione at the gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at himfortunately dumbledore arrived moments later the babble died awayanother year gone dumbledore said cheerfully and i must trouble you with an old mans wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast what a year it has been hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year startsnow as i understand it the house cup here needs awarding and the points stand thus in fourth place gryffindor with three hundred and twelve points in third hufflepuff with three hundred and fiftytwo ravenclaw has four hundred and twentysix and slytherin four hundred and seventy twoa storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the slytherin tableharry could see draco malfoy banging his goblet on the table it was a sickening sightyes yes well done slytherin said dumbledore however recent events must be taken into accountthe room went very still the slytherins smiles faded a littleahem said dumbledore i have a few lastminute points to dish outlet me see yesfirst to mr ronald weasleyron went purple in the face he looked like a radish with a bad sunburnfor the bestplayed game of chess hogwarts has seen in many years i award gryffindor house fifty pointsgryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling the stars overhead seemed to quiver percy could be heard telling the other prefects my brother you know my youngest brother got past mcgonagalls giant chess setat last there was silence againsecond to miss hermione granger for the use of cool logic in the face of fire i award gryffindor house fifty pointshermione buried her face in her arms harry strongly suspected she had burst into tears gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves they were a hundred points up third to mr harry potter said dumbledore the room went deadly quiet for pure nerve and outstanding courage i award gryffindor house sixty pointsthe din was deafening those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that gryffindor now had four hundred and seventytwo points exactly the same as slytherin they had tied for the house cup if only dumbledore had given harry just one more pointdumbledore raised his hand the room gradually fell silentthere are all kinds of courage said dumbledore smiling it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies but just as much to stand up to our friends i therefore award ten points to mr neville longbottomsomeone standing outside the great hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place so loud was the noise that erupted from the gryffindor table harry ron and hermione stood up to yell and cheer as neville white with shock disappeared under a pile of people hugging him he had never won so much as a point for gryffindor beforeharry still cheering nudged ron in the ribs and pointed at malfoy who couldnt have looked more stunned and horrified if hed just had the bodybind curse put on himwhich means dumbledore called over the storm of applause for even ravenclaw and hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of slytherin we need a little change of decorationhe clapped his hands in an instant the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold the huge slytherin serpent vanished and a towering gryffindor lion took its place snape was shaking professor mcgonagalls hand with a horrible forced smile he caught harrys eye and harry knew at once that snapes feelings toward him hadnt changed one jot this didnt worry harry it seemed as though life would be back to normal next year or as normal as it ever was at hogwartsit was the best evening of harrys life better than winning at quidditch or christmas or knocking out mountain trolls he would never ever forget tonightharry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come but come they did to their great surprise both he and ron passed with good marks hermione of course had the best grades of the first years even neville scraped through his good herbology mark making up for his abysmal potions one they had hoped that goyle who was almost as stupid as he was mean might be thrown out but he had passed too it was a shame but as ron said you couldnt have everything in lifeand suddenly their wardrobes were empty their trunks were packed nevilles toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets notes were handed out to all students warning them not to use magic over the holidays i always hope theyll forget to give us these said fred weasley sadly hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake they were boarding the hogwarts express talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier eating bettie botts every flavor beans as they sped past muggle towns pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats pulling into platform nine and threequarters at kings cross stationit took quite a while for them all to get off the platform a wizened old guard was up by the ticket barrier letting them go through the gate in twos and threes so they didnt attract attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarming the mugglesyou must come and stay this summer said ron both of you ill send you an owlthanks said harry ill need something to look forward to people jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway

aunt who wastrying to heave dudley to his feetall right said harry all right uncle vernon sat back down breathing like a winded rhinoceros andwatching harry closely out of the corners of his small sharp eyesever since harry had come home for the summer holidays unclevernon had been treating him like a bomb that might go off at anymoment because harry potter wasnt a normal boy as a matter offact he was as not normal as it is possible to beharry potter was a wizard a wizard fresh from his first year athogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry and if the dursleyswere unhappy to have him back for the holidays it was nothing to howharry felthe missed hogwarts so much it was like having a constantstomachache he missed the castle with its secret passageways andghosts his classes though perhaps not snape the potions master themail arriving by owl eating banquets in the great hall sleeping in hisfourposter bed in the tower dormitory visiting the gamekeeperhagrid in his cabin next to

called mugglesnot a drop of magical blood in their veinsand as far as they were concerned having a wizard in the family wasa matter of deepest shame uncle vernon had even padlockedharrys owl hedwig inside her cage to stop her from carryingmessages to anyone in the wizarding worldharry looked nothing like the rest of the family uncle vernon waslarge and neckless with an enormous black mustache aunt petuniawas horsefaced and bony dudley was blond pink and porky harryon the other hand was small and skinny with brilliant green eyes andjetblack hair that was always untidy he wore round glasses and onhis forehead was a thin lightningshaped scarit was this scar that made harry so particularly unusual even for awizard this scar was the only hint of harrys very mysterious past ofthe reason he had been left on the dursleys doorstep eleven yearsbeforeat the age of one year old harry had somehow survived a curse fromthe greatest dark sorcerer of all time lord voldemort whose namemost witches and wizards still feared to speak harrys parents haddied in voldemorts attack but harry had escaped with his lightningscar and somehow nobody understood why voldemorts powers hadbeen destroyed the instant he had failed to kill harryso harry had been brought up by his dead mothers sister and herhusband he had spent ten years with the dursleys neverunderstanding why he kept making odd things happen without meaningto believing the dursleys story that he had got his scar in the carcrash that had killed his parentsand then exactly a year ago hogwarts had written to harryand the whole story had come out harry had taken up his place atwizard school where he and his scar were famous but now theschool year was over and he was back with the dursleys for thesummer back to being treated like a

beetles that stopped them from locking him in thecupboard under the stairs with his wand and broomstick for the firstcouple of weeks back harry had enjoyed muttering nonsense wordsunder his breath and watching dudley tearing out of the room as fastas his fat legs would carry him but the long silence from ron andhermione had made harry feel so cut off from the magical world thateven taunting dudley had lost its appeal and now ron and hermionehad forgotten his birthdaywhat wouldnt he give now for a message from hogwarts from anywitch or wizard hed almost be glad of a sight of his archenemydraco malfoy just to be sure it hadnt all been a dream not that his whole year at hogwarts had been fun at the very end oflast term harry had come facetoface with none other than lordvoldemort himself voldemort might be a ruin of his former self buthe was still terrifying still cunning still determined to regain powerharry had slipped through voldemorts clutches for a second time butit had been a narrow escape and even now weeks later harry keptwaking in the night drenched in cold sweat wondering wherevoldemort was now remembering his livid face his wide mad eyesharry suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench he had beenstaring absentmindedly into the hedge and the hedge was staring backtwo enormous green eyes had appeared among the leavesharry jumped to his feet just as a jeering voice

catflapin the bedroom door so that small amounts of food could bepushed inside three times a day they let harry out to use thebathroom morning and evening otherwise he was locked in his roomaround the clockthree days later the dursleys were showing no sign of relenting andharry couldnt see any way out of his situation he lay on his bedwatching the sun sinking behind the bars on the window and wonderedmiserably what was going to happen to himwhat was the good of magicking himself out of his room if hogwartswould expel him for doing it yet life at privet drive had reached analltime low now that the dursleys knew they werent going to wakeup as fruit bats he had lost his only weapon dobby might have savedharry from horrible happenings at hogwarts but the way things weregoing hed probably starve to death anywaythe catflap rattled and aunt petunias hand appeared pushing a bowlof canned soup into the room harry whose insides were aching withhunger jumped off his bed and seized it the soup was stonecold buthe drank half of it in one gulp then he crossed the room to hedwigscage and tipped the soggy vegetables at the bottom of the bowl intoher empty food tray she ruffled her feathers and gave him a look ofdeep disgustits no good turning your beak up at it thats all weve got saidharry grimlyhe put the empty bowl back on the floor next to the catflap and layback down on the bed

that he was on show in a zoo with a card readingunderage wizard attached to his cage people goggled through the barsat him as he lay starving and weak on a bed of straw he sawdobbys face in the crowd and shouted out asking for help but dobbycalled harry potter is safe there sir and vanished then thedursleys appeared and dudley rattled the bars of the cage laughing athimstop it harry muttered as the rattling pounded in his sore headleave me alone cut it out im trying to sleep he opened his eyes moonlight was shining through the bars on thewindow and someone was goggling through the bars at him a frecklefacedredhaired longnosed someoneron weasley was outside harrys windowhh a p t e rr t h rr e ethe burrowronl breathed harry creeping to the window and pushing it up sothey could talk

treestouchdown said fred as with a slight bump they hit the groundthey had landed next to a tumbledown garage in a small yard andharry looked out for the first time at rons houseit looked as though it had once been a large stone pigpen but extrarooms had been added here and there until it was several stories highand so crooked it looked as though it were held up by magic whichharry reminded himself it probably was four or five chimneys wereperched on top of the red roof a lopsided sign stuck in the groundnear the entrance read the burrow around the front door lay a jumbleof rubber boots and a very rusty cauldron several fat brown chickenswere pecking their way around the yardits not much said ronits wonderful said harry happily thinking of privet drivethey got out of the carnow well go

harry dear she said come in andhave some breakfastshe turned and walked back into the house and harry after a nervousglance at ron who nodded encouragingly followed herthe kitchen was small and rather cramped there was ascrubbed wooden table and chairs in the middle and harry sat downon the edge of his seat looking around he had never been in a wizardhouse beforethe clock on the wall opposite him had only one hand and no numbersat all written around the edge were things like time to make tea timeto feed the chickens and youre late books were stacked three deep onthe mantelpiece books with titles like charm your own cheeseenchantment in baking and one minute feasts its magic and unlessharrys ears were deceiving him the old radio next to the sink had justannounced that coming up was witching hour with the popularsinging sorceress celestina warbeckmrs weasley was clattering around cooking breakfast a littlehaphazardly throwing dirty looks at her sons as she threw sausagesinto the frying pan every now and then she muttered things like dontknow what you were thinking of and never would have believed iti dont blame you dear she assured harry tipping eight or ninesausages onto his plate arthur and i have been worried about youtoo just last night we were saying wed come and get you ourselves ifyou hadnt written back to ron by friday but really she was nowadding three fried eggs to his plate flying an illegal car halfwayacross the country anyone could have seen you she flicked her wand casually at the dishes in the sink which began toclean themselves clinking gently in the backgroundit was cloudy mum said fredyou keep your mouth closed while youre eating mrs weasleysnappedthey were starving him mum said georgeand you said mrs weasley but it was with a slightly softenedexpression that she started cutting harry bread and buttering it forhimat that moment there was a diversion in the form of a smallredheaded figure in a long nightdress who appeared in the kitchengave a small squeal and ran out againginny said ron in an undertone to harry my sister shes beentalking about you all summeryeah shell be wanting your autograph harry fred said with a grinbut he caught his mothers eye and bent his face over his plate withoutanother word nothing more was said until all four plates were cleanwhich took a surprisingly short timeblimey im tired yawned fred setting down his knife and fork at lasti think ill go to bed and you will not snapped mrs weasley its your own fault youvebeen up all night youre going to degnome the garden for me theyregetting completely out of hand again oh mum and you two she said glaring at ron and fred you can go up tobed dear she added to harry you didnt ask them to fly thatwretched car but harry who felt wide awake said quickly ill help ron ivenever seen a degnoming thats very sweet of you dear but its dull work said mrs weasleynow lets see what lockharts got to say on the subject and she pulled a heavy book from the stack on the mantelpiecegeorge groanedmum we know how to degnome a garden harry looked at the cover of mrs weasleys book written across itin fancy gold letters were the words gilderoy lockharts guide tohousehold pests there was a big photograph on the front of a very goodioiking wizard with wavy blond hair and bright blue eyes as alwaysin the wizarding world the photograph was moving the wizard whoharry supposed was gilderoy lockhart kept winking cheekily up atthem all mrs weasley beamed down at himoh he is marvelous she said he knows his household pests allright its a wonderful book mum fancies him said fred in a very audible whisperdont be so ridiculous fred said mrs weasley her cheeks ratherpink all right if you think you know better than lockhart you can goand get on with it and woe betide you if theres a single gnome in thatgarden when i come out to inspect ityawning and grumbling the weasleys slouched outside with harrybehind them the garden was large and in harrys eyes exactlywhat a garden should be the dursleys wouldnt have liked it therewere plenty of weeds and the grass needed cutting but there weregnarled trees all around the walls plants harry had never seen spillingfrom every flower bed and a big green pond full of frogsmuggles have garden gnomes too you know harry told ronthey crossed the lawnyeah ive seen those things they think are gnomes said ron bentdouble with his head in a peony bush like fat little santa clauses withfishing rods there was a violent scuffling noise the peony bush shuddered andron straightened up this is a gnome he said grimlygerroff me gerroff me squealed the gnomeit was certainly nothing like santa claus it was small and leatherylooking with a large knobby bald head exactly like a potato ron heldit at arms length as it kicked out at him with its horny little feet hegrasped it around the ankles and turned it upside downthis is what you have to do he said he raised the gnome above hishead gerroff me and started to swing it in great circles like alasso seeing the shocked look on harrys face ron added it doesnthurt them youve just got to make them really dizzy so they cant findtheir way back to the gnomeholeshe let go of the gnomes ankles it flew twenty feet into the air andlanded with a thud in the field over the hedgepitiful said fred i bet i can get mine beyond that stumpharry learned quickly not to feel too sorry for the gnomes he decidedjust to drop the first one he caught over the hedge but the gnomesensing weakness sank its razorsharp teeth into harrys finger and hehad a hard job shaking it off untilwow harry that mustve been fifty feet the air was soon thick with flying gnomessee theyre not too bright said george seizing five or six gnomes atonce the moment they know the degnomings going on they stormup to have a look youd think theyd have learned by now just to stayputsoon the crowd of gnomes in the field started walking away in astraggling line their little shoulders hunchedtheyll be back said ron as they watched the gnomes disappear intothe hedge on the other side of the field they love it here dadstoo soft with them he thinks theyre funny just then the front door slammedhes back said george dads homethey hurried through the garden and back into the housemr weasley was slumped in a kitchen chair with his glasses off andhis eyes closed he was a thin man going bald but the little hair hehad was as red as any of his childrens he was wearing long greenrobes which were dusty and travelwornwhat a night he mumbled groping for the teapot as they all satdown around him nine raids nine and old mundungus fletchertried to put a hex on me when i had my back turned mr weasley took a long gulp of tea and sighedfind anything dad said fred eagerlyall i got were a few shrinking door keys and a biting kettle yawnedmr weasley there was some pretty nasty stuff that wasnt mydepartment though mortlake was taken away for questioning aboutsome extremely odd ferrets but thats the committee on experimentalcharms thank goodness why would anyone bother making door keys shrink said georgejust mugglebaiting sighed mr weasley sell them a key thatkeeps shrinking to nothing so they can never find it when they need itof course its very hard to convict anyone because no mugglewould admit their key keeps shrinking theyll insist they just keeplosing it bless them theyll go to any lengths to ignore magic even ifits staring them in the face but the things our lot have taken toenchanting you wouldnt believe like cars for instancemrs weasley had appeared holding a long poker like a sword mrweasleys eyes jerked open he stared guiltily at his wifeccars molly dearyes arthur cars said mrs weasley her eyes flashing imagine awizard buying a rusty old car and telling his wife all he wanted to dowith it was take it apart to see how it worked while really he wasenchanting it to make it flymr weasley blinkedwell dear i think youll find that he would be quite within the law todo that even if er he maybe would have done better to um tell hiswife the truth theres a loophole in the law youll find as longas he wasnt intending to fly the car the fact that the car could flywouldnt arthur weasley you made sure there was a loophole when youwrote that law shouted mrs weasley just so you could carry ontinkering with all that muggle rubbish in your shed and for yourinformation harry arrived this morning in the car you werentintending to flyharry said mr weasley blankly harry whohe looked around saw harry and jumpedgood lord is it harry potter very pleased to meet you rons told usso much about your sons flew that car to harrys house and back last nightshouted mrs weasley what have you got to say about that ehdid you really said mr weasley eagerly did it go all right i imean he faltered as sparks flew from mrs weasleys eyes that that was very wrong boys very wrong indeed lets leave them to it ron muttered to harry as mrs weasleyswelled like a bullfrog come on ill show you my bedroomthey slipped out of the kitchen and down a narrow passageway to anuneven staircase which wound its way zigzagging upthrough the house on the third landing a door stood ajar harry justcaught sight of a pair of bright brown eyes staring at him before itclosed with a snapginny said ron you dont know how weird it is for her to be thisshy she never shuts up normally they climbed two more flights until they reached a door with peelingpaint and a small plaque on it saying ronalds roomharry stepped in his head almost touching the sloping ceiling andblinked it was like walking into a furnace nearly everything in ronsroom seemed to be a violent shade of orange the bedspread thewalls even the ceiling then harry realized that ron had coverednearly every inch of the shabby wallpaper with posters of the sameseven witches and wizards all wearing bright orange robes carryingbroomsticks and waving energeticallyyour quidditch team said harrythe chudley cannons said ron pointing at the orange bedspreadwhich was emblazoned with two giant black cs and a speedingcannonball ninth in the leaguerons school spellbooks were stacked untidily in a corner next to apile of comics that all seemed to feature the adventures of martinmiggs the mad muggle rons magic wand was lying on top of a fishtank full of frog spawn on the windowsill next to his fat gray ratscabbers who was snoozing in a patch of sunharry stepped over a pack of selfshuffling playing cards on the floorand looked out of the tiny window in the field far below he could seea gang of gnomes sneaking one by one back through the weasleyshedge then he turned to look at ron who was watching him almostnervously as though waiting for his opinionits a bit small said ron quickly not like that room you hadwith the muggles and im right underneath the ghoul in the attiches always banging on the pipes and groaning but harry grinning widely said this is the best house ive everbeen inrons ears went pink c h a p t e r v o u rat f l v rr hand blottsife at the burrow was as different as possible from life on privetdrive the dursleys liked everything neat and ordered the weasleyshouse burst with the strange and unexpected harry got a shock thefirst time he looked in the mirror over the kitchen mantelpiece and itshouted tuck your shirt in scruffy the ghoul in the attic howledand dropped pipes whenever he felt things were getting too quiet andsmall explosions from fred and georges bedroom were consideredperfectly normal what harry found most unusual about life at ronshowever wasnt the talking mirror or the clanking ghoul it was thefact that everybody there seemed to like himmrs weasley fussed over the state of his socks and tried to force himto eat fourth helpings at every meal mr weasley liked harry to sitnext to him at the dinner table so that he could bombard him withquestions about life with muggles asking him to explain how thingslike plugs and the postal service workedfascinating he would say as harry talked him through using atelephone ingenious really how many ways muggles have found ofgetting along without magicharry heard from hogwarts one sunny morning about a week after hehad arrived at the burrow he and ron went down to breakfast to findmr and mrs weasley and ginny already sitting at the kitchen tablethe moment she saw harry ginny accidentally knocked her porridgebowl to the floor with a loud clatter ginny seemed very prone toknocking things over whenever harry entered a room she dived underthe table to retrieve the bowl and emerged with her face glowing likethe setting sun pretending he hadnt noticed this harry sat down andtook the toast mrs weasley offered himletters from school said mr weasley passing harry and ronidentical envelopes of yellowish parchment addressed in green inkdumbledore already knows youre here harry doesnt miss a trickthat man you twove got them too he added as fred and georgeambled in still in their pajamasfor a few minutes there

coming yearsecondyear students will requirethe standard book of spells grade by miranda goshawkbreak with a banshee by gilderoy lockhartgadding with ghouls by gilderoy lockhartholidays with hags by

finished his own list peered over at harrysyouve been told to get all lockharts books too he said the newdefense against the dark arts teacher must be a fan bet its awitchat this point fred caught his mothers eye and quickly busied himselfwith the marmaladethat lot wont come cheap said george with a quick look at hisparents lockharts books are really expensive well well manage said mrs weasley but she looked worried iexpect well be able to pick up a lot of ginnys things secondhandoh are you starting at hogwarts this year harry asked ginnyshe nodded blushing to the roots of her flaming hair and put herelbow in the butter dish fortunately no one saw this except harrybecause just then rons elder brother percy walked in he wasalready dressed his hogwarts prefect badge pinned to his sweatervestmorning all said percy briskly lovely dayhe sat down in the only remaining chair but leapt up again almostimmediately pulling from underneath him a moulting gray featherduster at least that was what harry thought it was until he saw thatit was breathingerrol said ron taking the limp owl from percy and extracting aletter from under its wing finally hes got hermiones answer iwrote to her saying we were going to try and rescue you from thedursleyshe carried errol to a perch just inside the back door and tried tostand him on it but errol flopped straight off again so ron lay him onthe draining board instead muttering pathetic then he rippedopen hermiones letter and read it out louddear ron and harry if youre therei hope everything went all right and that harry is okay and thatyou didnt do anything illegal to get him out ron because that wouldget harry into trouble too ive been really worried and if harry is allright will you please let me know at once but perhaps it would be

thatblocked it from view of the village below meaning that they couldpractice quidditch there as long as they didnt fly too highthey couldnt use real quidditch balls which would have been hard toexplain if they had escaped and flown away over the village insteadthey threw apples for one another to catch they took turns ridingharrys nimbus two thousand which was easily the best broomrons old shooting star was often outstripped by passing butterfliesfive minutes later they were marching up the hill broomsticks overtheir shoulders they had asked percy if he wanted to join them buthe had said he was busy harry had only seen percy at mealtimes sofar he stayed shut in his room the rest of the timewish i knew what he was up to said fred frowning hes nothimself his exam results came the

course it was only in the wizarding world that he hadmoney you couldnt use galleons sickles and knutsin muggle shops he had never mentioned his gringotts bank accountto the dursleys he didnt think their horror of anything connected withmagic would stretch to a large pile of goldmrs weasley woke them all early the following wednesday after aquick half a dozen bacon sandwiches each they pulled on their coatsand mrs weasley took a flowerpot off the kitchen mantelpiece andpeered insidewere running low arthur she sighed well have to buy somemore today ah well guests first after you harry dearand

he took a deep breath scatteredthe powder into the flames and stepped forward the fire felt like awarm breeze he opened his mouth and immediately swallowed a lotof hot ashddiagon alley he coughedit felt as though he was being sucked down a giant drain he seemedto be spinning very fast the roaring in his ears was deafening hetried to keep his eyes open but the whirl of green flames made himfeel sick something hard knocked his elbow and he tucked it intightly still spinning and spinning now it felt as though cold handswere slapping his face squinting through his glasses he saw a blurredstream of fireplaces and snatched glimpses of the rooms beyond hisbacon sandwiches were churning inside him he closed his eyes againwishing it would stop and thenhe fell face forward onto cold stone and felt the bridge of his glassessnapdizzy and bruised covered in soot he got gingerly to his feet holdinghis broken glasses up to his eyes he was cite alone but where hewas he had no idea all he could tell was that he was standing in thestone fireplace of what looked like a large dimly lit wizards shop butnothing in here was ever likely to be on a hogwarts school lista glass case nearby held a withered hand on a cushion a bloodstainedpack of cards and a staring glass eye evillooking masks stared downfrom the walls an assortment of human bones lay upon the counterand rusty spiked instruments hung from the ceiling even worse thedark narrow street harry could see through the dusty shop windowwas definitely not diagon alleythe sooner he got out of here the better nose still stinging where ithad hit the hearth harry made his way swiftly and silently toward thedoor but before hed got halfway toward it two people appeared onthe other side of the glass and one of them was thevery last person harry wanted to meet when he was lost covered insoot and wearing broken glasses draco malfoyharry looked quickly around and spotted a large black cabinet to hisleft he shot inside it and pulled the doors closed leaving a small crackto peer through seconds later a bell clanged and malfoy stepped intothe shopthe man who followed could only be dracos father he had the samepale pointed face and identical cold gray eyes mr malfoy crossedthe shop looking lazily at the items on display and rang a bell on thecounter before turning to his son and saying touch nothing dracomalfoy who had reached for the glass eye said i thought you weregoing to buy me a presenti said i would buy you a racing broom said his father drumming hisfingers on the counterwhats the good of that if im not on the house

cabinet past the glass cases and out of the shopdoorclutching his broken glasses to his face harry stared around he hademerged into a dingy alleyway that seemed to be made up entirely ofshops devoted to the dark arts the one hed just left borgin andburkes looked like the largest but opposite was a nasty windowdisplay of shrunken heads and two doors down a large cage wasalive with gigantic black spiders two shabbylooking wizards werewatching him from the shadow of a doorway muttering to each otherfeeling jumpy harry set off trying to hold his glasses on straight andhoping against hope hed be

though he wanted to stop them leaving but he barelycame up to hagrids waist and seemed to think better of it they hurried up thestreet the grangers shaking with fright and mrs weasley beside herself withfurya fine example to set for your children brawling in public whatgilderoy lockhart mustve thought he was pleased said fred didnt you hear him as we were leaving he wasasking that bloke from the daily prophet if hed be able to work the fight intohis report said it was all publicity but it was a subdued group that headed back to the fireside in the leakycauldron where harry the weasleys and all their shopping would betraveling back to the burrow using floo powder they said goodbye to thegrangers who were leaving the pub for the muggle street on the other sidemr weasley started to askthem how bus stops worked but stopped quickly at the look on mrsweasleys faceharry took off his glasses and put them safely in his pocket beforehelping himself to floo powder it definitely wasnt his favorite way totravelc hh a p t e rr f i v ethe whompingwillowhe end of the summer vacation came too quickly for harrys likinghe was looking forward to getting back to hogwarts but his monthat the burrow had been the happiest of his life it was difficult not tofeel jealous of ron when he thought of the dursleys and the sort ofwelcome he could expect next time he turned up on privet driveon their last evening mrs weasley conjured up a sumptuous dinnerthat included all of harrys favorite things ending with amouthwatering treacle pudding fred and george rounded off theevening with a display of filibuster fireworks they fiiled the kitchenwith red and blue stars that bounced from ceiling to wall for at leasthalf an hour then it was time for a last mug of hot chocolate andbedit took a long while to get started next morning they were up atdawn but somehow they still seemed to have a great deal to domrs weasley dashed about in a bad mood looking for spare socks andquills people kept colliding on the stairs halfdressed with bits of toastin their hands and mr weasley nearly broke his neck tripping over astray chicken as he crossed the yard carrying ginnys trunk to the carharry couldnt see how eight people six large trunks two owls and arat were going to fit into one small ford anglia he had reckoned ofcourse without the special features that mr weasley had addednot a word to molly he whispered to harry as he opened the trunkand showed him how it had been magically expanded so that theluggage fitted easilywhen at last they were all in the car mrs weasley glanced into theback seat where harry ron fred george and percy were all sittingcomfortably side by side and said muggles do know more than wegive them credit for dont they she and ginny got into the front seatwhich had been stretched so that it resembled a park bench i meanyoud never know it was this roomy from the outside would youmr weasley started up the engine and they trundled out of the yardharry turning back for a last look at the house he barely had time towonder when hed see it again when they were back george hadforgotten his box of filibuster fireworks five minutes after that theyskidded to a halt in the yard so that fred could run in for hisbroomstick they had almost reached the highway when ginnyshrieked that shed left her diary by the time she had clambered backinto the car they were running very late and tempers were runninghighmr weasley glanced at his watch and then at his wifemolly dear no arthur no one would see this little button here is an invisibility booster iinstalled thatd get us up in the air then we fly above the cloudswed be there in ten minutes and no one would be any the wiser i said no arthur not in broad daylight they reached kings cross at a quarter to eleven mr weasleydashed across the road to get trolleys for their trunks and they allhurried into the stationharry had caught the hogwarts express the previous year the trickypart was getting onto platform nine and threequarters which wasntvisible to the muggle eye what you had to do was walk through thesolid barrier dividing platforms nine and ten it didnt hurt but it had tobe done carefully so that none of the muggles noticed you vanishingpercy first said mrs weasley looking nervously at the clockoverhead which showed they had only five minutes to disappearcasually through the barrierpercy strode briskly forward and vanished mr weasley went nextfred and george followedill take ginny and you two come right after us mrs weasley toldharry and ron grabbing ginnys hand and setting off in the blink ofan eye they were gonelets go together weve only got a minute ron said to harryharry made sure that hedwigs cage was safely wedged on top of histrunk and wheeled his trolley around to face the barrier he feltperfectly confident this wasnt nearly as uncomfortable as using floopowder both of them bent low over the handles of their trolleys andwalked purposefully toward the barrier gathering speed a few feetaway from it they broke into a run andcrashboth trolleys hit the barrier and bounced backward rons trunk felloff with a loud thump harry was knocked off his feet and hedwigscage bounced onto the shiny floor and she rolled away shriekingindignantly people all around them stared and a guard nearby yelledwhat in blazes dyou think youre doinglost control of the trolley harry gasped clutching his ribs as hegot up ron ran to pick up hedwig who was causing such a scenethat there was a lot of muttering about cruelty to animals from thesurrounding crowdwhy cant we get through harry hissed to roni dunno ron looked wildly around a dozen curious people were stillwatching themwere going to miss the train ron whispered i dont understandwhy the gateways sealed itself harry looked up at the giant clock with a sickening feeling in the pitof his stomach ten seconds nine seconds he wheeled his trolley forward cautiously until it was right against thebarrier and pushed with all his might the metal remained solidthree seconds two seconds one second its gone said ron sounding stunned the trains left what ifmum and dad cant get back through to us have you got anymuggle moneyand they marched off through the crowd of curious muggles out ofthe station and back onto the side road where the old ford anglia wasparkedron unlocked the cavernous trunk with a series of taps from his wandthey heaved their luggage back in put hedwig on the back seat andgot into the frontcheck that no ones watching said ron starting the ignition withanother tap of his wand harry stuck his head out of the windowtraffic was rumbling along the main road ahead but their street wasemptyokay he saidron pressed a tiny silver button on the dashboard the car aroundthem vanished and so did they harry could feel the seat vibratingbeneath him hear the engine feel his hands on his knees and hisglasses on his nose but for all he could see he had become a pair ofeyeballs floating a few feet above the ground in a dingy street full ofparked carslets go said rons voice from his rightand the ground and the dirty buildings on either side fell awaydropping out of sight as the car rose in seconds the whole of londonlay smoky and glittering below themthen there was a popping noise and the car harry and ronreappeareduhoh said ron jabbing at the invisibility booster its faulty both of them pummeled it the car vanished then it flickered backagainhold on ron yelled and he slammed his foot on the accelerator they shot straight into the low woolly clouds and everythingturned dull and foggynow what said harry blinking at the solid mass of cloud pressingin on them from all sideswe need to see the train to know what direction to go in said rondip back down again quickly they dropped back beneath the clouds and twisted around in theirseats squinting at the groundi can see it harry yelled right ahead therethe hogwarts express was streaking along below them like a scarletsnakedue north said ron checking the compass on the dashboardokay well just have to check on it every half hour or so hold onand they shot up through the clouds a minute later they burst outinto a blaze of sunlightit was a different world the wheels of the car skimmed the sea offluffy cloud the sky a bright endless blue under the blinding white sunall weve got to worry about now are airplanes said ronthey looked at each other and started to laugh for a long time theycouldnt stopit was as though they had been plunged into a fabulous dream thisthought harry was surely the only way to travel past swirls andturrets of snowy cloud in a car full of hot bright sunlight with a fatpack of toffees in the glove compartment and the prospect of seeingfreds and georges jealous faces when theylanded smoothly and spectacularly on the sweeping lawn in front ofhogwarts castlethey made regular checks on the train as they flew farther andfarther north each dip beneath the clouds showing them a differentview london was soon far behind them replaced by neat greenfields that gave way in turn to wide purplish moors a great city alivewith cars like multicolored ants villages with tiny toy churchesseveral uneventful hours later however harry had to admit thatsome of the fun was wearing off the toffees had made themextremely thirsty and they had nothing to drink he and ron hadpulled off their sweaters but harrys tshirt was sticking to the backof his seat and his glasses kept sliding down to the end of his sweatynose he had stopped noticing the fantastic cloud shapes now andwas thinking longingly of the train miles below where you could buyicecold pumpkin juice from a trolley pushed by a plump witch whyhadnt they been able to get onto platform nine and threequarterscant be much further can it croaked ron hours later still as thesun started to sink into their floor of cloud staining it a deep pinkready for another check on the trainit was still right below them winding its way past a snowcappedmountain it was much darker beneath the canopy of cloudsron put his foot on the accelerator and drove them upward againbut as he did so the engine began to whineharry and ron exchanged nervous glancesits probably just tired said ron its never been this far beforeand they both pretended not to notice the whining growinglouder and louder as the sky became steadily darker stars wereblossoming in the blackness harry pulled his sweater back on trying to ignore the way the windshield wipers were now waving feebly as though in protestnot far said ron more to the car than to harry not farnow and he patted the dashboard nervouslywhen they flew back beneath the clouds a little while later theyhad to squint through the darkness for a landmark they knewthere harry shouted making ron and hedwig jumpstraight aheadsilhouetted on the dark horizon high on the cliff over the lakestood the many turrets and towers of hogwarts castlebut the car had begun to shudder and was losing speedcome on ron said cajolingly giving the steering wheel a little shake nearly there come on the engine groaned narrow jets of steam were issuing from under the hood harry found himself gripping the edges of his seatvery hard as they flew toward the lakethe car gave a nasty wobble glancing out of his window harrysaw the smooth black glassy surface of the water a mile belowrons knuckles were white on the steering wheel the car wobbledagaincome on ron mutteredthey were over the lake the castle was right ahead ronput his foot downthere was a loud clunk a splutter and the engine died completelyuhoh said ron into the silencethe nose of the car dropped they were falling gathering speedheading straight for the solid castle wallnoooooo ron yelled swinging the steering wheel around theymissed the dark stone wall by inches as the car turned in a great arcsoaring over the dark greenhouses then the vegetable patch and thenout over the black lawns losing altitude all the timeron let go of the steering wheel completely and pulled his wand out ofhis back pocketstop stop he yelled whacking the dashboard and thewindshield but they were still plummeting the ground flying up towardthemwatch out for that tree harry bellowed lunging for thesteering wheel but too latecrunchwith an earsplitting bang of metal on wood they hit the thick treetrunk and dropped to the ground with a heavy jolt steam wasbillowing from under the crumpled hood hedwig was shrieking interror a golfballsize lump was throbbing on harrys head where hehad hit the windshield and to his right ron let out a low despairinggroanare you okay harry said urgentlymy wand said ron in a shaky voice look at my wand it had snapped almost in two the tip was dangling limply held on by afew splintersharry opened his mouth to say he was sure theyd be able to mend itup at the school but he never even got started at that very momentsomething hit his side of the car with the force of ay charging bull sending him lurching sideways into ron just as anequally heavy blow hit the roofwhats happen ron gasped staring through the windshield and harry looked aroundjust in time to see a branch as thick as a python smash into it the treethey had hit was attacking them its trunk was bent almost double andits gnarled boughs were pummeling every inch of the car it couldreachaaargh said ron as another twisted limb punched a large dent intohis door the windshield was now trembling under a hail of blows fromknucklelike twigs and a branch as thick as a battering ram waspounding furiously on the roof which seemed to be cavingrun for it ron shouted throwing his full weight against his door butnext second he had been knocked backward into harrys lap by avicious uppercut from another branchwere done for he moaned as the ceiling sagged but suddenly thefloor of the car was vibrating the engine had restartedreverse harry yelled and the car shot backward the tree was stilltrying to hit them they could hear its roots creaking as it almost rippeditself up lashing out at them as they sped out of reachthat panted ron was close well done car the car however had reached the end of its tether with two sharpclunks the doors flew open and harry felt his seat tip sideways nextthing he knew he was sprawled on the damp ground loud thuds toldhim that the car was ejecting their luggage from the trunk hedwigscage flew through the air and burst open she rose out of it with anangry screech and sped off toward the castleywithout a backward look then dented scratched and steamingthe car rumbled off into the darkness its rear lights blazing angrilycome back ron yelled after it brandishing his broken wanddadll kill mebut the car disappeared from view with one last snort from itsexhaustcan you believe our luck said ron miserably bending down topick up scabbers of all the trees we couldve hit we had to getone that hits backhe glanced over his shoulder at the ancient tree which was stillflailing its branches threateninglycome on said harry wearily wed better get up to the schoolit wasnt at all the triumphant arrival they had pictured stiff coldand bruised they seized the ends of their trunks and began draggingthem up the grassy slope toward the great oak front doorsi think the feasts already started said ron dropping his trunk atthe foot of the front steps and crossing quietly to look through abrightly lit window hey harry come and look its the sortingharry hurried over and together he and ron peered in at the greathallinnumerable candles were hovering in midair over four longcrowded tables making the golden plates and goblets sparkleoverhead the bewitched ceiling which always mirrored the skyoutside sparkled with starsthrough the forest of pointed black hogwarts hats harry saw a longline of scaredlooking first years fiiing into the hall ginnywas among them easily visible because of her vivid weasley hairmeanwhile professor mcgonagall a bespectacled witch with her hairin a tight bun was placing the famous hogwarts sorting hat on astool before the newcomersevery year this aged old hat patched frayed and dirty sorted newstudents into the four hogwarts houses gryffindor hufflepuffravenclaw and slytherin harry well remembered putting it onexactly one year ago and waiting petrified for its decision as itmuttered aloud in his ear for a few horrible seconds he had fearedthat the hat was going to put him in slytherin the house that hadturned out more dark witches and wizards than any other but he hadended up in gryffindor along with ron hermione and the rest of theweasleys last term harry and ron had helped gryffindor win thehouse championship beating slytherin for the first time in sevenyearsa very small mousyhaired boy had been called forward to place thehat on his head harrys eyes wandered past him to where professordumbledore the headmaster sat watching the sorting from the stafftable his long silver beard and halfmoon glasses shining brightly in thecandlelight several seats along harry saw gilderoy lockhartdressed in robes of aquamarine and there at the end was hagridhuge and hairy drinking deeply from his goblethang on harry muttered to ron theres an empty chair at thestaff table wheres snapeprofessor severus snape was harrys least favorite teacher harryalso happened to be snapes least favorite student cruel sarcasticand disliked by everybody except the students from his own houseslytherin snape taught potionsmaybe hes ill said ron hopefullymaybe hes left said harry because he missed out on the defenseagainst dark arts job againor he might have been sacked said ron enthusiastically i meaneveryone hates him or maybe said a very cold voice right behind them hes waiting tohear why you two didnt arrive on the school trainharry spun around there his black robes rippling in a cold breezestood severus snape he was a thin man with sallow skin a hookednose and greasy shoulderlength black hair and at this moment hewas smiling in a way that told harry he and ron were in very deeptroublefollow me said snapenot daring even to look at each other harry and ron followed snapeup the steps into the vast echoing entrance hall which was lit withflaming torches a delicious smell of food was wafting from the greathall but snape led them away from the warmth and light down anarrow stone staircase that led into the dungeonsin he said opening a door halfway down the cold passageway andpointingthey entered snapes office shivering the shadowy walls were linedwith shelves of large glass ars in which floated all manner ofrevolting things harry didnt really want to know the name of at themoment the fireplace was dark and empty snape closed the doorand turned to look at themso he said softly the train isnt good enough for the famous harrypotter and his faithful sidekick weasley wanted to arrive with a bangdid we boysno sir it was the barrier at kings cross it silence said snape coldly what have you done with thecarron gulped this wasnt the first time snape had given harry theimpression of being able to read minds but a moment later he understood as snape unrolled todays issue of the evening prophetyou were seen he hissed showing them the headline flying ford anglia mystifies muggles he began to readaloud two muggles in london convinced they saw an old carflying over the post

muggle artifacts officehe said looking up at ron and smiling still more nastily deardear his own son harry felt as though hed just been walloped in the stomach byone of the mad trees larger branches if anyone found out mrweasley had bewitched the car he hadnt thought of that i noticed in my search of the park that considerable damageseems to have been done to a very valuable whomping willowsnape went onthat tree did more damage to us than we ron blurted outsilence snapped snape again most unfortunately you arenot in my house and the decision to expel you does not rest withme i shall go and fetch the people who do have that happy poweryou will wait hereharry and ron stared at each other whitefaced harry didntfeel hungry any more he now felt extremely sick he tried not tolook at a large slimy something suspended in green liquid on ashelf behind snapes desk if snape had gone to fetch professormcgonagall head of gryffindor house they were hardly any betteroff she might be fairer than snape but she was still extremely strictten minutes later snape returned and sure enough it was professormcgonagall who accompanied him harry had seen professormcgonagall angry on several occasions but either he had forgottenjust how thin her mouth could go or he had never seen her this angrybefore she raised her wand the moment she entered harry and ronboth flinched but she merely pointed it at the empty fireplace whereflames suddenly eruptedsit she said and they both backed into chairs by the fireexplain she said her glasses glinting ominouslyron launched into the story starting with the barrier at the stationrefusing to let them throughso we had no choice professor we couldnt get on the trainwhy didnt you send us a letter by owl i believe you have an owlprofessor mcgonagall said coldly to harryharry gaped at her now she said it that seemed the obvious thing tohave donei i didnt think that said professor mcgonagall is obviousthere was a knock on the office door and snape now looking happierthan ever opened it there stood the headmaster professordumbledoreharrys whole body went numb dumbledore was looking unusuallygrave he stared down his very crooked nose at them andharry suddenly found himself wishing he and ron were still beingbeaten up by the whomping willowthere was a long silence then dumbledore said please explain whyyou did thisit would have been better if he had shouted harry hated thedisappointment in his voice for some reason he was unable to lookdumbledore in the eyes and spoke instead to his knees he tolddumbledore everything except that mr weasley owned thebewitched car making it sound as though he and ron had happened tofind a flying car parked outside the station he knew dumbledorewould see through this at once but dumbledore asked no questionsabout the car when harry had finished he merely continued to peerat them through his spectacleswell go and get our stuff said ron in a hopeless sort of voicewhat are you talking about weasley barked professormcgonagallwell youre expelling us arent you said ronharry looked quickly at dumbledorenot today mr weasley said dumbledore but i must impress uponboth of you the seriousness of what you have done i will be writing toboth your families tonight i must also warn you that if you do anythinglike this again i will have no choice but to expel yousnape looked as though christmas had been canceled he cleared histhroat and said professor dumbledore these boys have flouted thedecree for the restriction of underage wizardry caused seriousdamage to an old and valuable tree surely acts of this nature iit will be for professor mcgonagall to decide on these boyspunishments severus said dumbledore calmly they are in herhouse and are therefore her responsibility he turned to professormcgonagall i must go back to the feast minerva ive got to giveout a few notices come severus theres a deliciouslooking custard tart i want to sample snape shot a look of pure venom at harry and ron as he allowedhimself to be swept out of his office leaving them alone with professor mcgonagall who was still eyeing them like a wrathful eagleyoud better get along to the hospital wing weasley yourebleedingnot much said ron hastily wiping the cut over his eye withhis sleeve professor i wanted to watch my sister being sorted the sorting ceremony is over said professor mcgonagallyour sister is also in gryffindoroh good said ronand speaking of gryffindor professor mcgonagall saidsharply but harry cut in professor when we took the car termhadnt started so so gryffindor shouldnt really have pointstaken from it should it he finished watching her anxiouslyprofessor mcgonagall gave him a piercing look but he was sureshe had almost smiled her mouth looked less thin anywayi will not take any points from gryffindor she said andharrys heart lightened considerably but you will both get a detentionit was better than harry had expected as for dumbledoreswriting to the dursleys that was nothing harry knew perfectlywell theyd just be disappointed that the whomping willow hadntsquashed him flatprofessor mcgonagall raised her wand again and pointed it at snapesdesk a large plate of sandwiches two silver goblets and a jug oficedpumpkin juice appeared with a popyou will eat in here and then go straight up to your dormitory shesaid i must also return to the feastwhen the door had closed behind her ron let out a long low whistlei thought wed had it he said grabbing a sandwichso did i said harry taking one toocan you believe our luck though said ron thickly through amouthful of chicken and ham fred and george mustve flown thatcar five or six times and no muggle ever saw them he swallowedand took another huge bite why couldnt we get through the barrierharry shrugged well have to watch our step from now on thoughhe said taking a grateful swig of pumpkin juice wish we couldvegone up to the feast she didnt want us showing off said ron sagely doesnt wantpeople to think its clever arriving by flying carwhen they had eaten as many sandwiches as they could the platekept refilling itself they rose and left the office treading the familiarpath to gryffindor tower the castle was quiet it seemed that thefeast was over they walked past muttering portraits and creakingsuits of armor and climbed narrow flights of stone stairs until at lastthey reached the passage where the secret entrance to gryffindortower was hidden behind an oil painting of a very fat woman in apink silk dresspassword she said as they approacheder said harrythey didnt know the new years password not having met agryffindor prefect yet but help came almost immediately they heardhurrying feet behind them and turned to see hermione dashing towardthemthere you are where have you been the most ridiculous rumors someone said youd been expelled for crashing a flying carwell we havent been expelled harry assured heryoure not telling me you did fly here said hermione soundingalmost as severe as professor mcgonagallskip the lecture said ron impatiently and tell us the newpasswordits wattlebird said hermione impatiently but thats not the point her words were cut short however as the portrait of the fat ladyswung open and there was a sudden storm of clapping it looked asthough the whole of gryffindor house was still awake packed intothe circular common room standing on the lopsided tables andsquashy armchairs waiting for them to arrive arms reached throughthe portrait hole to pull harry and ron inside leaving hermione toscramble in after thentbrilliant yelled lee jordan inspired what an entrance flying acar right into the whomping willow peoplell be talking about thatone for years good for you said a fifth year harry had never spoken to someonewas patting him on the back as though hed just won a marathonfred and george pushed their way to the front of the crowd and saidtogether why couldnt weve come in the car ehron was scarlet in the face grinning embarrassedly but harry couldsee one person who didnt look happy at all percy was visible overthe heads of some excited first years and he seemed to be trying toget near enough to start telling them off harry nudged ron in theribs and nodded in percys direction ron got the point at oncegot to get upstairs bit tired he said and the two of them startedpushing their way toward the door on the other side of the roomwhich led to a spiral staircase and the dormitoriesnight harry called back to hermione who was wearing a scowljust like percysthey managed to get to the other side of the common room stillhaving their backs slapped and gained the peace of the staircasethey hurried up it right to the top and at last reached the door oftheir old dormitory which now had a sign on it saying second yearsthey entered the familiar circular room with its five fourpostershung with red velvet and its high narrow windows their trunks hadbeen brought up for them and stood at the ends of their bedsron grinned guiltily at harryi know i shouldntve enjoyed that or anything but the dormitory door flew open and in came the other second yeargryffindor boys seamus finnigan dean thomas and

a slight stiffness in theway she said morning which told harry that she was stilldisapproving of the way they had arrived neville longbottom on theother hand greeted them cheerfully neville was a roundfaced andaccidentprone boy with the worst memory of anyone harry had evermetmails due any minute i think grans sending a few things i forgotharry had only just started his porridge when sure

stretched out a shaking hand eased the envelope from errolsbeak and slit it open neville stuffed his fingers in his ears a splitsecond later harry knew why he thought for a moment it hadexploded a

over them a fewpeople laughed and gradually a babble of talk broke out againhermione closed voyages with vampires and looked down at the topof rons headwell i dont know what you expected ron but you dont tell me i deserved it snapped ronharry pushed his porridge away his insides were burning with guiltmr weasley was facing an inquiry at work after all mr and mrsweasley had done for him over the

seemed to think they had now been punished enough andwas being perfectly friendly againas they neared the greenhouses they saw the rest of the classstanding outside waiting for professor sprout harry ron andhermione had only just joined them when she came striding into viewacross the lawn accompanied by gilderoy lockhart professorsprouts arms were full of bandages and with another twinge of guiltharry spotted the whomping willow in the distance several of itsbranches now in slingsprofessor sprout was a squat little witch who wore a patched hat overher flyaway hair there was usually a large amount of earth on herclothes and her fingernails would have made aunt petunia faintgilderoy lockhart however was immaculate in sweeping robes ofturquoise his golden hair shining under a perfectly positioned turquoisehat with gold trimmingoh hello there he called beaming around at the assembledstudents just been showing professor sprout the right way to doctora whomping willow but i

who waslooking distinctly disgruntled not at all her usual cheerful selfthere was a murmur of interest they had only ever worked ingreenhouse one before greenhouse three housed far more interestingand dangerous plants professor sprout took a large key from her beltand unlocked the door harry caught a whiff of damp earth andfertilizer mingling with the heavy perfume of some giant umbrellasizedflowers dangling from the ceiling he was about to follow ronand hermione inside when lockharts hand shot outharry ive been wanting a word you dont mind if hes a couple ofminutes late do you professor sproutjudging by professor sprouts scowl she did mind but lockhart saidthats the ticket and closed the greenhouse door in her faceharry said lockhart his large white teeth gleaming in

few seconds then remembering he was supposed tobe in the greenhouse he opened the door and slid insideprofessor sprout was standing behind a trestle bench in the center of the greenhouse about twenty pairs of differentcolored earmuffs were lying on the bench when harry had taken his placebetween ron and hermione she said well be repotting mandrakes today now who can tell me the properties of the mandraketo nobodys surprise hermiones hand was first into the airsmandrake or mandragora is a powerful restorative said hermionesounding as usual as though she had swallowed the textbook it isused to

alsohowever dangerous who can tell me whyhermiones hand narrowly missed harrys glasses as it shot up againthe cry of the mandrake is fatal to anyone who hears it she saidpromptlyprecisely take another ten points said professor sprout now themandrakes we have here are still very youngshe pointed to a row of deep trays as she spoke and everyoneshuffled forward for a better look a hundred or so tufty little plantspurplish green in color were growing there in rows they looked quiteunremarkable to harry who didnt have the slightest idea whathermione meant by the cry of the mandrakeeveryone take a pair of earmuffs said professor sproutthere was a scramble as everyone tried to seize a pair that wasntpink and fluffywhen i tell you to put them on make sure your ears are completelycovered said professor sprout when it is safe to remove them iwill give you the thumbsup right earmuffs onharry snapped the earmuffs over his ears they shut out soundcompletely professor sprout put the pink fluffy pair over her ownears rolled up the sleeves of her robes grasped one of the tufty plantsfirmly and pulled hardharry let out a gasp of surprise that no one could hearinstead of roots a small muddy and extremely ugly baby popped outof the earth the leaves were growing right out of his head he hadpale green mottled skin and was clearly bawling at the top of hislungsprofessor sprout took a large plant pot from under the table andplunged the mandrake into it burying him in dark damp compost untilonly the tufted leaves were visible professor sprout dusted off herhands gave them all the thumbsup and removed her own earmuffsas our mandrakes are only seedlings their cries wont kill yet shesaid calmly as though shed just done nothing more exciting than watera begonia however they will knock you out

a tray there is a large supply of pots here compost in thesacks over there and be careful of the venemous tentacula itsteethingshe gave a sharp slap to a spiky dark red plant as she spoke makingit draw in the long feelers that had been inching sneakily over hershoulderharry ron and hermione were joined at their tray by a curlyhairedhufflepuff boy harry knew by sight but had never spoken tojustin finchfletchley he said brightly shaking harry by the handknow who you are of course the famous harry potter and yourehermione granger always top in everythinghermione beamed as she had her hand shaken too and ronweasley wasnt that your flying carron didnt smile the howler was obviously still on his mindthat lockharts something isnt he said justin happily as theybegan fiiling their plant

down for eton you know i cant tell you how glad iam i came here instead of course mother was slightly disappointedbut since i made her read lockharts books i think shes begun to seehow useful itll be to have a fully trained wizard in the family after that they didnt have much chance to talk their earmuffs wereback on and they needed to concentrate on the mandrakes professorsprout had made it look extremely easy but it wasnt the mandrakesdidnt like coming out of the earth but didnt seem to want to go backinto it either they squirmed kicked flailed their sharp little fists andgnashed their teeth harry spent ten whole minutes trying to squash aparticularly fat one into a potby the end of the class harry like everyone else was sweatyaching and covered in earth everyone traipsed back to the castle fora quick wash and then the gryffindors hurried off to transfigurationprofessor mcgonagalls classes were always hard work but todaywas especially difficult everything harry had learned last yearseemed to have leaked out of his head during the summer he wassupposed to be turning a beetle into a button but all he managedto do was give his beetle a lot of exercise as it scuttled over thedesktop avoiding his wandron was having far worse problems he had patched up his wandwith some borrowed spellotape but it seemed to be damaged beyondrepair it kept crackling and sparking at odd moments and every timeron tried to transfigure his beetle it engulfed him in thick gray smokethat smelled of rotten eggs unable to see what he was doing ronaccidentally squashed his beetle with his elbow and had to ask for anew one professor mcgonagall wasnt pleasedharry was relieved to hear the lunch bell his brain felt like a wrungsponge everyone fiied out of the classroom except him and ron whowas whacking his wand furiously on the deskstupid useless thing write home for another one harry suggested as the wand let off avolley of bangs like a firecrackeroh yeah and get another howler back said ron stuffing the nowhissing wand into his bag its your own fault your wand got snapped they went down to lunch where rons mood was not improved byhermiones showing them the handful of perfect coat buttons she hadproduced in transfigurationwhatve we got this afternoon said harry hastily changing thesubjectdefense against the dark arts said hermione at oncewhy demanded ron seizing her schedule have you outlined alllockharts lessons in little heartshermione snatched the schedule back blushing furiouslythey finished lunch and went outside into the overcast courtyardhermione sat down on a stone step and buried her nose in voyageswith vampires again harry and ron stood talking about quidditch forseveral minutes before harry became aware that he was being closelywatched looking up he saw the very small mousyhaired boy hedseen trying on the sorting hat last night staring at harry as thoughtransfixed he was clutching what looked like an ordinary mugglecamera and the moment harry looked at him he went bright redall right harry im im colin creevey he said breathlessly takinga tentative step forward im in gryffindor too dyou think would itbe all right if can i have a picture he

all this whats all this gilderoy lockhart was stridingtoward them his turquoise robes swirling behind him whos giving out signed photosharry started to speak but he was cut short as lockhart flung anarm around his shoulders and thundered jovially shouldnt haveasked we meet again harrypinned to lockharts side and burning with humiliation harrysaw malfoy slide smirking back into the crowdcome on then mr creevey said lockhart beaming at colina double portrait cant do better than that and well both sign itfor youcolin fumbled for his camera and took the picture as the bellrang behind them

schoolmates wont think youre setting yourself up somuch deaf to harrys stammers lockhart swept him down a corridorlined with staring students and up a staircaselet me just say that handing out signed

chortle i dont think youre quite there yetthey had reached lockharts classroom and he let harry go atlast harry yanked his robes straight and headed for a seat at the veryback of the class where he busied himself with piling all seven oflockharts books in front of him so that he could avoid looking at thereal thingthe rest of the class came clattering in and ron and hermione satdown on either side of harryyou couldve fried an egg on your face said ron youd better hopecreevey doesnt meet ginny or theyll be starting a harry potter fanclubshut up snapped harry the last thing he needed was for lockhartto hear the phrase harry potter fan clubwhen the whole class was seated lockhart cleared his throat loudlyand silence fell he reached forward picked up neville longbottomscopy of travels with

dean thomas who were sitting in front were shakingwith silent laughter hermione on the other hand was listening tolockhart with rapt attention and gave a start when he mentioned hernamebut miss hermione granger knew my secret ambition is to rid theworld of evil and market my own range of haircare potions goodgirl in fact he flipped her paper over full marks where is misshermione grangerhermione raised a trembling handexcellent beamed lockhart quite excellent take ten points forgryffindor and so to business he bent down behind his desk and lifted a large covered cage onto itnow be warned it is my job to arm you against the foulestcreatures known to wizardkind you may find yourselves facing yourworst fears in this room know only that no harm can befall you whilsti am here all i ask is that you remain calmin spite of himself harry leaned around his pile of books for a betterlook at the cage lockhart placed a hand on the cover dean andseamus had stopped laughing now neville was cowering in his frontrow seati must ask you not to scream said lockhart in a low voice it mightprovoke themas the whole class held its breath lockhart whipped off the coveryes he said dramatically freshly caught cornish pixies seamus finnigan couldnt control himself he let out a snort oflaughter that even lockhart couldnt mistake for a scream of terroryes he smiled at seamuswell theyre not theyre not very dangerous are they seamuschokeddont be so sure said lockhart waggling a finger annoyingly atseamus devilish tricky little blighters they can bethe pixies were electric blue and about eight inches high with pointedfaces and voices so shrill it was like listening to a lot of budgiesarguing the moment the cover had been removed theyhad started jabbering and rocketing around rattling the bars andmaking bizarre faces at the people nearest themright then lockhart said loudly lets see what you make ofthem and he opened the cageit was pandemonium the pixies shot in every direction like rocketstwo of them seized neville by the ears and lifted him into the airseveral shot straight through the window showering the back rowwith broken glass the rest proceeded to wreck the classroom moreeffectively than a rampaging rhino they grabbed ink bottles andsprayed the class with them shredded books and papers tore picturesfrom the walls upended the waste basket grabbed bags and booksand threw them out of the smashed window within minutes half theclass was sheltering under desks and neville was swinging from theiron chandelier in the ceilingcome on now round them up round them up theyre only pixieslockhart shoutedhe rolled up his sleeves brandished his wand and bellowedpeskipiksi pesternomiit had absolutely no effect one of the pixies seized his wand andthrew it out of the window too lockhart gulped and dived under hisown desk narrowly avoiding being squashed by neville who fell asecond later as the chandelier gave waythe bell rang and there was a mad rush toward the exit in the relativecalm that followed lockhart straightened up caught sight of harryron and hermione who were almost at the door and said well illask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage heswept past them and shut the door quickly behind himcan you believe him roared ron as one of the remaining pixies bithim painfully on the earhe just wants to give us some handson experience said hermioneimmobilizing two pixies at once with a clever freezing charm andstuffing them back into their cagehands on said harry who was trying to grab a pixie dancing out ofreach with its tongue out hermione he didnt have a clue what hewas doing rubbish said hermione youve read his books look at all thoseamazing things hes done he says hes done ron mutteredarry spent a lot of time over the next few days dodging out of sightwhenever he saw gilderoy lockhart coming down a corridor harderto avoid was colin creevey who seemed to have memorized harrysschedule nothing seemed to give colin a bigger thrill than to say allright harry six or seven times a day and hear hello colin backhowever exasperated harry sounded when he said ithedwig was still angry with harry about the disasterous car journeyand rons wand was still malfunctioning surpassing itself on fridaymorning by shooting out of rons hand in charms and hitting tiny oldprofessor flitwick squarely between the eyes creating a largethrobbing green boil where it had struck so with one thing andanother harry was quite glad to reach the weekend he ron andhermione were planning to visit hagrid on saturday morning harryhowever was shaken awake several hours earlierthan he would have liked by oliver wood captain of the gryffindorquidditch teamwhassamatter said harry groggilyquidditch practice said wood come onharry squinted at the window there was a thin mist hanging acrossthe pinkandgold sky now that he was awake he couldntunderstand how he could have slept through the racket the birds weremakingoliver harry croaked its the crack of dawnexactly said wood he was a tall and burly sixth year and at themoment his eyes were gleaming with a crazed enthusiasm its partof our new training program come on grab your broom and lets gosaid wood heartily none of the other teams have started training yetwere going to be first off the mark this year yawning and shivering slightly harry climbed out of bed and tried tofind his quidditch robesgood man said wood meet you on the field in fifteen minuteswhen hed found his scarlet team robes and pulled on his cloak forwarmth harry scribbled a note to ron explaining where hed gone andwent down the spiral staircase to the common room his nimbus twothousand on his shoulder he had just reached the portrait hole whenthere was a clatter behind him and colin creevey came dashing downthe spiral staircase his camera swinging madly around his neck andsomething clutched in his handi heard someone saying your name on the stairs harry look whative got here ive had it developed i wanted to show you harry looked bemusedly at the photograph colin was brandishingunder his nosea moving blackandwhite lockhart was tugging hard on an armharry recognized as his own he was pleased to see that hisphotographic self was putting up a good fight and refusing to bedragged into view as harry watched lockhart gave up andslumped panting against the white edge of the picturewill you sign it said colin eagerlyno said harry flatly glancing around to check that the room wasreally deserted sorry colin im in a hurry quidditch practice he climbed through the portrait holeoh wow wait for me ive never watched a quidditch gamebeforecolin scrambled through the hole after himitll be really boring harry said quickly but colin ignored him hisface shining with excitementyou were the youngest house player in a hundred years werentyou harry werent you said colin trotting alongside him youmust be brilliant ive never flown is it easy is that your ownbroom is that the best one there isharry didnt know how to get rid of him it was like having anextremely talkative shadowi dont really understand quidditch said colin breathlessly is ittrue there are four balls and two of them fly around trying to knockpeople off their broomsyes said harry heavily resigned to explaining the complicatedrules of quidditch theyre called bludgers there are two beaterson each team who carry clubs to beat the bludgers away from theirside fred and george weasley are the gryffindor beatersand what are the other balls for colin asked tripping down acouple of steps because he was gazing openmouthed at harrywell the quafe thats the biggish red one is the one that scoresgoals three chasers on each team throw the quaffle to each otherand try and get it through the goal posts at the end of the pitch theyre three long poles with hoops on the endand the fourth ball is the golden snitch said harry and its very small very fast anddifficult to catch but thats what the seekers got to do because agame of quidditch doesnt end until the snitch has been caught andwhichever teams seeker gets the snitch earns his team an extrahundred and fifty pointsand youre the gryffindor seeker arent you said colin in aweyes said harry as they left the castle and started across the dewdrenchedgrass and theres the keeper too he guards the goalposts thats it reallybut colin didnt stop questioning harry all the way down the slopinglawns to the quidditch field and harry only shook him off when hereached the changing rooms colin called after him in a piping voiceill go and get a good seat harry and hurried off to the standsthe rest of the gryffindor team were already in the changing roomwood was the only person who looked truly awake fred and georgeweasley were sitting puffyeyed and touslehaired next to fourth yearalicia spinnet who seemed to be nodding off against the wall behindher her fellow chasers katiebell and angelina johnson were yawning side by side oppositethemthere you are harry what kept you said wood briskly now iwanted a quick talk with you all before we actually get onto the fieldbecause i spent the summer devising a whole new training programwhich i really think will make all the difference wood was holding up a large diagram of a quidditch field on whichwere drawn many lines arrows and crosses in differentcolored inkshe took out his wand tapped the board and the arrows began towiggle over the diagram like caterpillars as wood launched into aspeech about his new tactics fred weasleys head drooped rightonto alicia spinnets shoulder and he began to snorethe first board took nearly twenty minutes to explain but there wasanother board under that and a third under that one harry sank intoa stupor as wood droned on and onso said wood at long last jerking harry from a wistful fantasyabout what he could be eating for breakfast at this very moment upat the castle is that clear any questionsive got a question oliver said george who had woken with astart why couldnt you have told us all this yesterday when wewere awakewood wasnt pleasednow listen here you lot he said glowering at them all weshould have won the quidditch cup last year were easily the bestteam but unfortunately owing to circumstances beyond our control harry shifted guiltily in his seat he had been unconscious in thehospital wing for the final match of the previous year meaning thatgryffindor had been a player short and had suffered their worstdefeat in three hundred yearswood took a moment to regain control of himself their last defeatwas clearly still torturing himso this year we train harder than ever before okay lets go andput our new theories into practice wood shouted seizing hisbroomstick and leading the way out of the locker rooms stiffleggedand still yawning his team followedthey had been in the locker room so long that the sun was upcompletely now although remnants of mist hung over the grass in thestadium as harry walked onto the field he saw ron and hermionesitting in the standsarent you finished yet called ron incredulouslyhavent even started said harry looking jealously at the toast andmarmalade ron and hermione had brought out of the great hallwoods been teaching us new moveshe mounted his broomstick and kicked at the ground soaring up intothe air the cool morning air whipped his face waking him far moreeffectively than woods long talk it felt wonderful to be back on thequidditch field he soared right around the stadium at full speedracing fred and georgewhats that funny clicking noise called fred as they hurtled aroundthe cornerharry looked into the stands colin was sitting in one of the highestseats his camera raised taking picture after picture the soundstrangely magnified in the deserted stadiumiolook this way harry this way he cried shrillywhos that said fredno idea harry lied putting on a spurt of speed that took him as faraway as possible from colinwhats going on said wood frowning as he skimmed through theair toward them whys that first year taking pictures i dont like ithe could be a slytherin spy trying to find out about our new trainingprogramhes in gryffindor said harry quicklyand the slytherins dont need a spy oliver said georgewhat makes you say that said wood testilybecause theyre here in person said george pointingseveral people in green robes were walking onto the field broomsticksin their handsi dont believe it wood hissed in outrage i booked the field fortoday well see about thiswood shot toward the ground landing rather harder than he meant toin his anger staggering slightly as he dismounted harry fred andgeorge followedflint wood bellowed at the slytherin captain this is our practicetime we got up specially you can clear off nowmarcus flint was

robespulled out his wand yelling youll pay for that one malfoy andpointed it furiously under flints arm at malfoys facea loud bang echoed around the stadium and a jet of green light shotout of the

over themany moving faces of lockhart watching him harry moved hisaching hand over what felt like the thousandth envelope writing outveronica smethleys address it must be nearly time to leave

turned into muddy streams and hagridspumpkins swelled to the size of garden sheds oliver woods enthusiasm forregular training sessions however was not dampened which was why harrywas to be found late

sessionfred and george who had been spying on the slytherin team had seen forthemselves the speed of those new nimbus two thousand and ones theyreported that the slytherin team was no more than seven greenish blursshooting through the air like missilesas harry squelched along the deserted corridor he came across somebodywho looked just as preoccupied as he was nearly headless nick the ghostof gryffindor tower was staring morosely out of a window mutteringunder his breath dont fulfill their requirements half an inch if that hello nick said harryhello hello said nearly headless nick starting and looking round hewore a dashing plumed hat on his long curly hair and a tunic with a ruffwhich concealed the fact that his neck was almost completely severed hewas pale as smoke and harry could see right through him to the dark skyand torrential rain outsideyou look troubled young potter said nick folding a transparent letter ashe spoke and tucking it inside his doubletso do you said harryah nearly headless nick waved an elegant hand a matter of noimportance its not as though i really wanted to join thought idapply but apparently i dont fulfill requirements in spite of his airy tone there was a look of great bitterness on his facebut you would think wouldnt you he erupted suddenly pulling the letterback out of his pocket that getting hit fortyfive times in the neck with ablunt axe would qualify you to join the headless huntoh yes said harry who was obviously supposed to agreei mean nobody wishes more than i do that it had all been quick and cleanand my head had come off properly i mean it would have saved me a greatdeal of pain and ridicule however nearly headless nick shook his letteropen and read furiously we can only accept huntsmen whose heads haveparted company with their bodies you will appreciate that it would beimpossible otherwise for members to participate in hunt activities such ashorseback headjuggling and head polo it is with the greatest regrettherefore that i must inform you that you do not fulfill our requirementswith very best wishes sir patrick delaneypodmorefuming nearly headless nick stuffed the letter awayhalf an inch of skin and sinew holding my neck on harry most peoplewould think thats good and beheaded but oh no its not enough for sirproperly decapitatedpodmorenearly headless nick took several deep breaths and then said in a farcalmer tone so whats bothering you anything i can dono said harry not unless you know where we can get seven freenimbus two thousand and ones for our match against sly the rest of harrys sentence was drowned out by a highpitched mewlingfrom somewhere near his ankles he looked down and found himself gazinginto a pair of lamplike yellow eyes it was mrs norris the skeletal gray catwho was used by the caretaker argus filch as a sort of deputy in hisendless battle against studentsyoud better get out of here harry said nick quickly filch isnt in agood mood hes got the flu and some third years accidentally plastered frogbrains all over the ceiling in dungeon five hes been cleaning all morningand if he sees you dripping mud all over the place right said harry backing away from the accusing stare of mrs norrisbut not quickly enough drawn to the spot by the mysterious power thatseemed to connect him with his foul cat argus filch burst suddenly througha tapestry to harrys right wheezing and looking wildly about for the rulebreakerthere was a thick tartan scarf bound around his head and his nosewas unusually purplefilth he shouted his jowls aquiver his eyes popping alarmingly as hepointed at the muddy puddle that had dripped from harrys quidditch robesmess and muck everywhere ive had enough of it i tell you follow mepotterso harry waved a gloomy goodbye to nearly headless nick and followedfilch back downstairs doubling the number of muddy footprints on thefloorharry had never been inside filchs office before it was a place moststudents avoided the room was dingy and windowless lit by a single oillamp dangling from the low ceiling a faint smell of fried fish lingered aboutthe place wooden filing cabinets stood around the walls from their labelsharry could see that they contained details of every pupil filch had everpunished fred and george weasley had an entire drawer to themselves ahighly polished collection of chains and manacles hung on the wall behindfilchs desk it was common knowledge that he was always beggingdumbledore to let him suspend students by their ankles from the ceilingfilch grabbed a quill from a pot on his desk and began shuffling aroundlooking for parchmentdung he muttered furiously great sizzling dragon bogies frog brainsrat intestines ive had enough of it make an example wheresthe form yes he retrieved a large roll of parchment from his desk drawer and stretched itout in front of him dipping his long black quill into the ink potname harry potter crime it was only a bit of mud said harryits only a bit of mud to you boy but to me its an extra hour scrubbingshouted filch a drip shivering unpleasantly at the end of his bulbous nosecrime befouling the castle suggested sentence dabbing at his streaming nose filch squinted unpleasantly at harry whowaited with bated breath for his sentence to fallbut as filch lowered his quill there was a great bang on the ceiling ofthe office which made the oil lamp rattlepeeves filch roared flinging down his quill in a transport of rage illhave you this time ill have youand without a backward glance at harry filch ran flatfooted from theoffice mrs norris streaking alongside himpeeves was the school poltergeist a grinning airborne menace who lived tocause havoc and distress harry didnt much like peeves but couldnt helpfeeling grateful for his timing hopefully whatever peeves had done and itsounded as though hed wrecked something very big this time woulddistract filch from harrythinking that he should probably wait for filch to come back harry sankinto a motheaten chair next to the desk there was only one thing on it apartfrom his halfcompleted form a large glossy purple envelope with silverlettering on the front with a quick glance at the door to check that filchwasnt on his way back harry picked up the envelope and read kwikspell acorrespondence course in beginners magicintrigued harry flicked the envelope open and pulled out the sheaf ofparchment inside more curly silver writing on the front page said feel outof step in the world of modern magic find yourself making excuses not toperform simple spells ever been taunted for

thumbed through the rest of the envelopes contents whyon earth did filch want a kwikspell course did this mean he wasnt aproper wizard harry was just reading lesson one holding your wandsome useful tips when shuffling footsteps outside told him filch wascoming back stuffing the parchment back into the envelope harry threw itback onto the desk just as the door openedfilch was looking triumphantthat vanishing cabinet was extremely valuable he was saying gleefully tomrs norris well have peeves out this time my sweet his eyes fell on harry and then darted to the kwikspell envelope whichharry realized too late was lying two feet away from where it had startedfilchs pasty face went brick red harry braced himself for a tidal wave offury filch hobbled across to his desk snatched up the envelope and threw itinto a drawerhave you did you read he sputteredno harry lied quicklyfilchs knobbly hands were twisting togetherif i thought youd read my private not that its mine for a friend be thatas it may however harry was staring at him alarmed filch had never looked madder his eyeswere popping a tic was going in one of his pouchy cheeks and the tartanscarf didnt helpvery well go and dont breathe a word not that however if you didntread go now i have to write up peeves report go amazed at his luck harry sped out of the office up the corridor and backupstairs to escape from filchs office without punishment was probablysome kind of school recordharry harry did it worknearly headless nick came gliding out of a classroom behind him harrycould see the wreckage of a large blackandgold cabinet that appeared tohave been dropped from a great heighti persuaded peeves to crash it right over filchs office said nick eagerlythought it might distract him was that you said harry gratefully yeah it worked i didnt even getdetention thanks nickthey set off up the corridor together nearly headless nick harry noticedwas still holding sir patricks rejection letteri wish there was something i could do for you about the headless huntharry saidnearly headless nick stopped in his tracks and harry walked right throughhim he wished he hadnt it was like stepping through an icy showerbut there is something you could do for me said nick excitedly harry would i be asking too much but no you wouldnt want what is it said harrywell this halloween will be my five hundredth deathday said nearlyheadless nick drawing himself up and looking dignifiedoh said harry not sure whether he should look sorry or happy about thisrightim holding a party down in one of the roomier

patrickhow very frightening and impressive you find meof of course said harrynearly headless nick beamed at him a deathday party said hermionekeenly when harry had changed at last and joined her and ron in thecommon room i bet there arent many living people who can say theyvebeen to one of those itll be fascinatingwhy would anyone want to celebrate the day they died said ron whowas halfway through his potions homework and grumpy sounds deaddepressing to me rain was still lashing the windows which were now inky black but insideall looked bright and cheerful the firelight glowed over the countlesssquashy armchairs where people sat reading talking doing homework or inthe case of fred and george weasley trying to find out what would happenif you fed a filibuster firework to a salamander fred had rescued thebrilliant orange firedwelling lizard from a care of magical creatures classand it was now smouldering gently on a table surrounded by a knot ofcurious peopleharry was at the point of telling ron and hermione about filch and thekwikspell course when the salamander suddenly whizzed into the airemitting loud sparks and bangs as it whirled wildly round the room thesight of percy bellowing himself hoarse at fred and george the spectaculardisplay of tangerine stars showering from the salamanders mouth and itsescape into the fire with accompanying explosions drove both filch and thekwikspell envelope from harrys mind by the time halloween arrivedharry was regretting his rash promise to go to the deathday party the rest ofthe school was happily anticipating their halloween feast the great hall hadbeen decorated with the usual live bats hagrids vast pumpkins had beencarved into lanterns large enough for three men to sit in and there wererumors that dumbledore had booked a troupe of dancing skeletons for theentertainmenta promise is a promise hermione reminded harry bossily you saidyoud go to the deathday partyso at seven oclock harry ron and hermione walked straight past thedoorway to the packed great hall which was glittering invitingly with goldplates and candles and directed their steps instead toward the dungeonsthe passageway leading to nearly headless nicks party had been linedwith candles too though the effect was far from cheerful these were longthin jetblack tapers all burning bright blue casting a dim ghostly lighteven over their own living faces the temperature dropped with every stepthey took as harry shivered and drew his robes tightly around him heheard what sounded like a thousand fingernails scraping an enormousblackboardis that supposed to be music ron whispered they turned a corner andsaw nearly headless nick standing at a doorway hung with black velvetdrapesmy dear friends he said mournfully welcome welcome so pleasedyou could come he swept off his plumed hat and bowed them insideit was an incredible sight the dungeon was full of hundreds of pearlywhitetranslucent people mostly drifting around a crowded dance floorwaltzing to the dreadful quavering sound of thirty musical saws played byan orchestra on a raised blackdraped platform a chandelier overheadblazed midnightblue with a thousand more black candles their breath rosein a mist before them it was like stepping into a freezershall we have a look around harry suggested wanting to warm up hisfeetcareful not to walk through anyone said ron nervously and they set offaround the edge of the dance floor they passed a group of gloomy nuns aragged man wearing chains and the fat friar a cheerful hufflepuff ghostwho was talking to a knight with an arrow sticking out of his forehead harrywasnt surprised to see that the bloody baron a gaunt staring slytheringhost covered in silver bloodstains was being given a wide berth by theother ghostsoh no said hermione stopping

quite disgusting large rotten fish were laidon handsome silver platters cakes burned charcoalblack were heaped onsalvers there was a great maggoty haggis a slab of cheese covered in furrygreen mold and in pride of place an enormous gray cake in the shape of atombstone with tarlike icing forming the words sir nicholas de mimsyporpingtondied st october harry watched amazed as a portly ghost approached the table crouchedlow and walked through it his mouth held wide so that it passed throughone of the stinking salmoncan you taste it if you walk though it harry asked himalmost said the ghost sadly and he drifted awayi expect theyve let it rot to give it a stronger flavor said hermioneknowledgeably pinching her nose and leaning closer to look at the putridhaggiscan we move i feel sick said ronthey had barely turned around however when a little man swoopedsuddenly from under the table and came to a halt in midair before themhello peeves said harry cautiouslyunlike the ghosts

aheadless horseman the assembly clapped wildly harry started to clap toobut stopped quickly at the sight of nicks facethe horses galloped into the middle of the dance floor and halted rearingand plunging at the front of the pack was a large ghost who held hisbearded head under his arm from which position he was blowing the hornthe ghost leapt down lifted his head high in the air so he could see over thecrowd everyone laughed and strode over to nearly headless nicksquashing his head back onto his necknick he roared how are you head still hanging in therehe gave a hearty guffaw and clapped nearly headless nick on the shoulderwelcome patrick said nick stifflylive uns said sir patrick spotting harry ron and hermione and givinga huge fake jump of astonishment so that his head fell off

as sir patricks head went sailing past him to loud cheersharry was very cold by now not to mention hungryi cant stand much more of this ron muttered his teeth chattering as theorchestra ground back into action and the ghosts swept back onto the dancefloorlets go harry agreedthey backed toward the door nodding and beaming at anyone who lookedat them and a minute later were hurrying back up the passageway full ofblack candlespudding might not be finished yet said ron hopefully leading the waytoward the steps to the entrance halland then harry heard itrip tear kill it was the same voice the same cold murderous voice he had heard inlockharts officehe stumbled to a halt clutching at the stone wall listening with all hismight looking around squinting up and down the dimly lit passagewayharry whatre you its that voice again shut up a minute soo hungry for so long listen said harry urgently and ron and hermione froze watching himkill time to kill the voice was growing fainter harry was sure it was moving away moving upward a mixture of fear and excitement gripped him as he staredat the dark ceiling how could it be moving upward was it a phantom towhom stone ceilings didnt matterthis way he shouted and he began to run up the stairs into the entrancehall it was no good hoping to hear anything here the babble of talk from thehalloween feast was echoing out of the great hall harry sprinted up themarble staircase to the first floor ron and hermione clattering behind himharry whatre we shhharry strained his ears distantly from the floor above and growing fainterstill he heard the voice i smell blood i smell bloodhis stomach lurched its going to kill someone he shouted and ignoring rons and hermionesbewildered faces he ran up the next flight of steps three at a time trying tolisten over his own pounding footsteps harry hurtled around the whole of the second floor ron and hermionepanting behind him not stopping until they turned a corner into the lastdeserted passageharry what was that all about said ron wiping sweat off his face icouldnt hear anything but hermione gave a sudden gasp pointing down the corridorlooksomething was shining on the wall ahead they approached slowlysquinting through the darkness foothigh words had been daubed on thewall between two windows shimmering in the light cast by the flamingtorches the chamber of secrets has been opened enemies of the heirbewarewhats that thing hanging underneath said ron a slight quiver in hisvoiceas they edged nearer harry almost slipped there was a large puddle ofwater on the floor ron and hermione grabbed him and they inched towardthe message eyes fixed on a dark shadow beneath it all three of themrealized what it was at once and leapt backward with a splashmrs norristhe caretakers cat was hanging by her tail from the torchbracket she was stiff as a board her eyes wide and staringfor a few seconds they didnt move then ron said lets get out of hereshouldnt we try and help harry began awkwardlytrust me said ron we dont want to be found herebut it was too late a rumble as though of distant thunder told them thatthe feast had just ended from either end of the corridor where they stoodcame the sound of hundreds of feet climbing the stairs and the loud happytalk of wellfed people next moment students were crashing into thepassage from both endsthe chatter the bustle the noise died suddenly as the people in front spottedthe hanging cat harry ron and hermione stood alone in the middle of thecorridor as silence fell among the mass of students pressing forward to seethe grisly sightthen someone shouted through the quietenemies of the heir beware youll be next mudbloodsit was draco malfoy he had pushed to the front of the crowd his cold eyesalive his usually bloodless face flushed as he grinned at the sight of thehanging immobile catc h a p t x ir n i n ethe wrtitingon the wallwhats going on here whats going on attracted no doubt bymalfoys shout argus filch came shouldering his way through thecrowd then he saw mrs norris and fell back clutching his face inhorrormy cat my cat whats happened to mrs norris he shriekedand his popping eyes fell on

just upstairs please feel free thank you gilderoy said dumbledorethe silent crowd parted to let them pass lockhart looking excited andimportant hurried after dumbledore so did professors mcgonagalland snapeas they entered lockharts darkened office there was a flurry ofmovement across the walls harry saw several of the lockharts in thepictures dodging out of sight their hair in rollers the real lockhart litthe candles on his desk and stood back dumbledore lay mrs norrison the polished surface and began to examine her harry ron andhermione exchanged tense looks and sank into chairs outside the poolof candlelight watchingthe tip of dumbledores long crooked nose was barely an inch frommrs norriss fur he was looking at her closely through his halfmoonspectacles his long fingers gently prodding and poking professormcgonagall was bent almost as close her eyes narrowed snapeloomed behind them half in shadow wearing a most peculiarexpression it was as though he was trying hard not to smile andlockhart was hovering around all of them making suggestionsit was definitely a curse that killed her probably the transmogrifiantorture ive seen it used many times so unlucky i wasnt there iknow the very countercurse that would have saved her lockharts comments were punctuated by filchs dry racking sobshe was slumped in a chair by the desk unable to look at mrs norrishis face in his hands much as he detested filch harrycouldnt help feeling a bit sorry for him though not nearly as sorry ashe felt for himself if dumbledore believed filch he would be expelledfor suredumbledore was now muttering strange words under his breath andtapping mrs norris with his wand but nothing happened shecontinued to look as though she had been recently stuffedi remember something very similar happening in ouagadogousaid lockhart a series of attacks the full storys in myautobiography i was able to provide the townsfolk with variousamulets which cleared the matter up at once the photographs of lockhart on the walls were all nodding inagreement as he talked one of them had forgotten to remove his hairnetat last dumbledore straightened upshes not dead argus he said softlylockhart stopped abruptly in the middle of counting the number ofmurders he had preventednot dead choked filch looking through his fingers at mrs norrisbut whys she all all stiff and frozenshe has been petrified said dumbledore ah i thought so saidlockhart but how i cannot say ask him shrieked filch turning his blotched and tearstained face toharryno second year could have done this said dumbledore firmly itwould take dark magic of the most advanced he did it he did it filch spat his pouchy face purpling you sawwhat he wrote on the wall he found in my office he knows im a im a filchs face worked horribly he knows im a squib hefinishedi never touched mrs norris harry said loudly uncomfortablyaware of everyone looking at him including all the lockharts on thewalls and i dont even know what a squib isrubbish snarled filch he saw my kwikspell letterif i might speak headmaster said snape from the shadows andharrys sense of forboding increased he was sure nothing snape hadto say was going to do him any goodpotter and his friends may have simply been in the wrong place at thewrong time he said a slight sneer curling his mouth as though hedoubted it but we do have a set of suspicious circumstances herewhy was he in the upstairs corridor at all why wasnt he at thehalloween feastharry ron and hermione all launched into an explanation about thedeathday party there were hundreds of ghosts theyll tell you we werethere but why not join the feast afterward said snape his black eyesglittering in the candlelight why go up to that corridorron and hermione looked at harrybecause because harry said his heart thumping very fastsomething told him it would sound very farfetched if he told them hehad been led there by a bodiless voice no one but he could hearbecause we were tired and wanted to go to bed he saidwithout any supper said snape a triumphant smile flickering acrosshis gaunt face i didnt think ghosts provided food fit for living peopleat their partieswe werent hungry said ron loudly as his stomach gave a hugerumblesnapes nasty smile widenedi suggest headmaster that potter is not being entirely truthful hesaid it might be a good idea if he were deprived of certain privilegesuntil he is ready to tell us the whole story i personally feel he shouldbe taken off the gryffindor quidditch team until he is ready to behonestreally severus said professor mcgonagall sharply i see noreason to stop the boy playing quidditch this cat wasnt hit over thehead with a broomstick there is no evidence at all that potter hasdone anything wrongdumbledore was giving harry a searching look his twinkling lightbluegaze made harry feel as though he were being xrayedinnocent until proven guilty severus he said firmlysnape looked furious so did filchmy cat has been petrified he shrieked his eyes popping i want tosee some punishmentwe will be able to cure her argus said dumbledore patientlyprofesser sprout recently managed to procure some mandrakes assoon as they have reached their full size i will have a potion made thatwill revive mrs norrisill make it lockhart butted in i must have done it a hundred timesi could whip up a mandrake restorative draught in my sleep excuse me said snape icily but i believe i am the potions masterat this schoolthere was a very awkward pauseyou may go dumbledore said to harry ron and hermionethey went as quickly as they could without actually running whenthey were a floor up from lockharts office they turned intoan empty classroom and closed the door quietly behind them harrysquinted at his friends darkened facesdyou think i should have told them about that voice i heardno said ron without hesitation hearing voices no one else canhear isnt a good sign even in the wizarding worldsomething in rons voice made harry ask you do believe me dontyoucourse i do said ron quickly but you must admit its weird i know its weird said harry the whole things weird what wasthat writing on the wall about the cbamber has been openedwhats that supposed to meanyou know it rings a sort of bell said ron slowly i think someonetold me a story about a secret chamber at hogwarts once mightvebeen bill and what on earths a squib said harryto his surprise ron stifled a sniggerwell its not funny really but as its filch he said a squib issomeone who was born into a wizarding family but hasnt got anymagic powers kind of the opposite of muggleborn wizards butsquibs are quite unusual if filchs trying to learn magic from akwikspell course i reckon he must be a squib it would explain a lotlike why he hates students so much ron gave a satisfied smilehes bittera clock chimed somewheremidnight said harry wed better get to bed before snape comesalong and tries to frame us for something elsefor a few days the school could talk of little else but the attack onmrs norris filch kept it fresh in everyones minds by pacing the spotwhere she had been attacked as though he thought the attacker mightcome back harry had seen him scrubbing the message on the wallwith mrs skowers allpurpose magical mess remover but to noeffect the words still gleamed as brightly as ever on the stone whenfilch wasnt guarding the scene of the crime he was skulking redeyedthrough the corridors lunging out at unsuspecting students andtrying to put them in detention for things like breathing loudly andlooking happyginny weasley seemed very disturbed by mrs norriss fateaccording to ron she was a great cat loverbut you havent really got to know mrs norris ron told herbracingly honestly were much better off without her ginnys liptrembled stuff like this doesnt often happen at hogwarts ronassured her theyll catch the maniac who did it and have him out ofhere in no time i just hope hes got time to petrify filch before hesexpelled im only joking ron added hastily as ginny blanchedthe attack had also had an effect on hermione it was quite usual forhermione to spend a lot of time reading but she was now doingalmost nothing else nor could harry and ron get much responsefrom her when they asked what she was up to and not until thefollowing wednesday did they find outharry had been held back in potions where snape had made him staybehind to scrape tubeworms off the desks after a hurried lunch hewent upstairs to meet ron in the library and saw justin finchfletchley the hufflepuff boy from herbology comingtoward him harry had just opened his mouth to say hello when justincaught sight of him turned abruptly and sped off in the oppositedirectionharry found ron at the back of the library measuring his history ofmagic homework professor binns had asked for a threefootlongcomposition on the medieval assembly of europeanwizardsi dont believe it im still eight inches short said ron furiously letting go of his parchment which sprang back into a rolland hermiones done four feet seven inches and her writingstiny where is she asked harry grabbing the tape measure and unrollinghis own homeworksomewhere over there said ron pointing along the shelves lookingfor another book i think shes trying to read the whole library beforechristmasharry told ron about justin finchfletchley running away from himdunno why you care i thought he was a bit of an idiot said ronscribbling away making his writing as large as possible all that junkabout lockhart being so great hermione emerged from between the bookshelves she looked irritableand at last seemed ready to talk to themall the copies of hogwarts a history have been taken out she saidsitting down next to harry and ron and theres a twoweek waitinglist i wish i hadnt left my copy at home but i couldnt fit it in my trunkwith all the lockhart bookswhy do you want it said harrythe same reason everyone else wants it said hermione to readup on the legend of the chamber of secretswhats that said harry quicklythats just it i cant remember said hermione biting her lip andi cant find the story anywhere else hermione let me read your composition said ron desperatelychecking his watchno i wont said hermione suddenly severe youve had tendays to finish it i only need another two inches come on the bell rang ron and hermione led the way to history of magicbickeringhistory of magic was the dullest subject on their schedule professorbinns who taught it was their only ghost teacher and the mostexciting thing that ever happened in his classes was his entering theroom through the blackboard ancient and shriveled many peoplesaid he hadnt noticed he was dead he had simply got up to teachone day and left his body behind him in an armchair in front of thestaff room fire his routine had not varied in the slightest sincetoday was as boring as ever professor binns opened his notes andbegan to read in a flat drone like an old vacuum cleaner until nearlyeveryone in the class was in a deep stupor occasionally coming tolong enough to copy down a name or date then falling asleep againhe had been speaking for half an hour when something happenedthat had never happened before hermione put up her handprofessor binns glancing up in the middle of a deadly dull lecture on the international warlock convention of looked amazedmiss er granger professor i was wondering if you could tell us anythingabout the chamber of secrets said hermione in a clear voicedean thomas who had been sitting with his mouth hanging opengazing out of the window jerked out of his trance lavender brownshead came up off her arms and neville longbottoms elbow slippedoff his deskprofessor binns blinkedmy subject is history of magic he said in his dry wheezy voice ideal with facts miss granger not myths and legends he cleared histhroat with a small noise like chalk sping and continued inseptember of that year a subcommittee of sardinian sorcerershe stuttered to a halt hermiones hand was waving in the air againmiss grantplease sir dont legends always have a basis in factprofessor binns was looking at her in such amazement harry wassure no student had ever interrupted him before alive or deadwell said professor binns slowly yes one could argue that isuppose he peered at hermione as though he had never seen astudent properly before however the legend of which you speak issuch a very sensational even ludicrous tale but the whole class was now hanging on professor binnss everyword he looked dimly at them all every face turned to his harrycould tell he was completely thrown by such an unusual show ofinterestoh very well he said slowly let me see the chamber ofsecrets you all know of course that hogwarts was founded over a thousandyears ago the precise date is uncertain by the four greatest witchesand wizards of the age the four school houses are named afterthem godric gryffindor helga hufflepuff rowena ravenclaw andsalazar slytherin they built this castle together far from pryingmuggle eyes for it was an age when magic was feared by commonpeople and witches and wizards suffered much persecutionhe paused gazed blearily around the room and continuedfor a few years the founders worked in harmony together seekingout youngsters who showed signs of magic and bringing them to thecastle to be educated but then disagreements sprang up betweenthem a rift began to grow between slytherin and the others slytherinwished to be more selective about the students admitted to hogwarts hebelieved that magical learning should be kept within allmagic familieshe disliked taking students of muggle parentage believing them to beuntrustworthy after a while there was a serious argument on thesubject between slytherin and gryffindor and slytherin left theschoolprofessor binns paused again pursing his lips looking like a wrinkledold tortoisereliable historical sources tell us this much he said but thesehonest facts have been obscured by the fanciful legend of thechamber of secrets the story goes that slytherin had built ahidden chamber in the castle of which the other founders knewnothingslytherin according to the legend sealed the chamber of secretsso that none would be able to open it until his own true heir arrived atthe school the heir alone would be able to unseal the chamber ofsecrets unleash the horror within and use it to purge the school ofall who were unworthy to study magicthere was silence as he finished telling the story but it wasnt theusual sleepy silence that filled professor binnss classes there wasunease in the air as everyone continued to watch him hoping formore professor binns looked faintly annoyedthe whole thing is arrant nonsense of course he said naturallythe school has been searched for evidence of such a chamber manytimes by the most learned witches and wizards it does not exist atale told to frighten the gulliblehermiones hand was back in the airsir what exactly do you mean by the horror within thechamberthat is believed to be some sort of monster which the heir ofslytherin alone can control said professor binns in his dry reedyvoicethe class exchanged nervous looksi tell you the thing does not exist said professor binns shuffling hisnotes there is no chamber and no monsterbut sir said seamus finnigan if the chamber can only be openedby slytherins true heir no one else would be able to find it wouldtheynonsense oflaherty said professor binns in an aggravatedtone if a long succession of hogwarts headmasters andheadmistresses havent found the thing but professor piped up parvati patil youd probably have to usedark magic to open it just because a wizard doesnt use dark magic doesnt mean hecant miss pennyfeather snapped professor binns i repeat if thelikes of dumbledore but maybe youve got to be related to slytherin so dumbledorecouldnt began dean thomas but professor binns had hadenoughthat will do he said sharply it is a myth it does not exist thereis not a shred of evidence that slytherin ever built so much as asecret broom cupboard i regret telling you such a foolish story wewill return if you please to history to solid believable verifiablefactand within five minutes the class had sunk back into its usual torpori always knew salazar slytherin was a twisted old loony ron toldharry and hermione as they fought their way through the teemingcorridors at the end of the lesson to drop off their bags beforedinner but i never knew he started all this pureblood stuff iwouldnt be in his house if you paid me honestly if the sorting hathad tried to put me in slytherin idve got the train straight backhome hermione nodded fervently but harry didnt say anything hisstomach had just dropped unpleasantlyharry had never told ron and hermione that the sorting hathad seriously considered putting him in slytherin he could rememberas though it were yesterday the small voice that had spoken in his earwhen hed placed the hat on his head a year before you could be greatyou know its all here in your head and slytherin would help you on theway to greatness no doubt about thatbut harry who had already heard of slytherin houses reputation for turning out dark wizards had thought desperately notslytherin and the hat had said oh well if youre sure better begryffindoras they were shunted along in the throng colin creevy went pasthiya harryhullo colin said harry automaticallyharry harry a boy in my class has been saying yourebut colin was so small he couldnt fight against the tide of peoplebearing him toward the great hall they heard him squeak see youharry and he was gonewhats a boy in his class saying about you hermione wonderedthat im slytherins heir i expect said harry his stomach droppinganother inch or so as he suddenly remembered the way justin finchfletchley had run away from him at lunchtimepeople herell believe anything said ron in disgustthe crowd thinned and they were able to climb the next staircasewithout difficultydyou really think theres a chamber of secrets ron askedhermionei dont know she said frowning dumbledore couldnt curemrs norris and that makes me think that whatever attacked hermight not be well humanas she spoke they turned a corner and found themselves at the endof the very corridor where the attack had happened they stoppedand looked the scene was just as it had been that night except thatthere was no stiff cat hanging from the torch bracket and an emptychair stood against the wall bearing the message the chamber ofsecrets has been openedthats where filch has been keeping guard ron mutteredthey looked at each other the corridor was desertedcant hurt to have a poke around said harry dropping his bag andgetting to his hands and knees so that he could crawl along searchingfor cluesscorch marks he said here and here come and look at this said hermione this is funny harry got up and crossed to the window next to the message on thewall hermione was pointing at the topmost pane where aroundtwenty spiders were scuttling apparently fighting to get through asmall crack a long silvery thread was dangling like a rope as thoughthey had all climbed it in their hurry to get outsidehave you ever seen spiders act like that said hermionewonderinglyno said harry have you ron ronhe looked over his shoulder ron was standing well back and seemedto be fighting the impulse to runwhats up said harryi dont like spiders said ron tenselyi never knew that said hermione looking at ron in surpriseyouve used spiders in potions loads of times i dont mind them dead said ron who was carefully lookinganywhere but at the window i just dont like the way they move hermione giggledits not funny said ron fiercely if you must know when i wasthree fred turned my my teddy bear into a great big fiithy spiderbecause i broke his toy broomstick you wouldnt like them either ifyoud been holding your bear and suddenly it had too many legs and he broke off shuddering hermione was obviously still trying not tolaugh feeling they had better get off the subject harry saidremember all that water on the floor where did that come fromsomeones mopped it upit was about here said ron recovering himself to walk a few pacespast filchs chair and pointing level with this doorhe reached for the brass doorknob but suddenly withdrew his hand asthough hed been burnedwhats the matter said harrycant go in there said ron gruffly thats a girls toiletoh ron there wont be anyone in there said hermione standing upand coming over thats moaning myrtles place come on lets havea lookand ignoring the large out of order sign she opened the doorit was the gloomiest most depressing bathroom harry had ever setfoot in under a large cracked and spotted mirror were a row ofchipped sinks the floor was damp and reflected the dull light givenoff by the stubs of a few candles burning low in their holders thewooden doors to the stalls were flaking and scratched and one ofthem was dangling off its hingesl hermione put her fingers to her lips and set off toward the end stallwhen she reached it she said hello myrtle how are youharry and ron went to look moaning myrtle was floating above thetank of the toilet picking a spot on her chinthis is a girls bathroom she said eyeing ron and harry suspiciouslytheyre not girlsno hermione agreed i just wanted to show them how er nice it isin hereshe waved vaguely at the dirty old mirror and the damp floorask her if she saw anything harry mouthed at hermionewhat are you whispering said myrtle staring at himnothing said harry quickly we wanted to ask i wish people would stop talking behind my back said myrtle in avoice choked with tears i do have feelings you know even if i amdead myrtle no one wants to upset you said hermione harry only no one wants to upset me thats a good one howled myrtle mylife was nothing but misery at this place and now people come alongruining my deathwe wanted to ask you if youve seen anything funny lately saidhermione quickly because a cat was attacked right outside yourfront door on halloweendid you see anyone near here that night said harryi wasnt paying attention said myrtle dramatically peeves upset meso much i came in here and tried to kill myself then of course iremembered that im that im already dead said ron helpfullyil myrtle gave a tragic sob rose up in the air turned over and divedheadfirst into the toilet splashing water all over them and vanishingfrom sight although from the direction of her muffled sobs she hadcome to rest somewhere in the ubendharry and ron stood with their mouths open but hermione shruggedwearily and said honestly that was almost cheerful for myrtle come on lets goharry had barely closed the door on myrtles gurgling sobs when aloud voice made all three of them jumpronpercy weasley had stopped dead at the head of the stairs prefectbadge agleam an expression of complete shock on his facethats a girls bathroom he gasped what were you just having a look around ron shrugged clues you know percy swelled in a manner that reminded harry forcefully of mrsweasleyget away from there perry said striding toward them andstarting to bustle them along flapping his arms dont you care whatthis looks like coming back here while everyones at dinner why shouldnt we be here said ron hotly stopping short and glaringat percy listen we never laid a finger on that catthats what i told ginny said percy fiercely but she still seems tothink youre going to be expelled ive never seen her so upset cryingher eyes out you might think of her all the first years are thoroughlyoverexcited by this business you dont care about ginny said ron whose ears were nowreddening youre just worried im going to mess up your chances ofbeing head boy five points from gryffindor percy said tersely fingering his prefectbadge and i hope it teaches you a lesson no more detective work orill write to mumand he strode off the back of his neck as red as rons earsharry ron and hermione chose seats as far as possible from percyin the common room that night ron was still in a very bad temper andkept blotting his charms homework when he reached absently for hiswand to remove the smudges it ignited the parchment fuming almostas much as his homework ron slammed the standard book of spellsgrade shut to harrys surprise hermione followed suitwho can it be though she said in a quiet voice as thoughcontinuing a conversation they had just been having whod want tofrighten all the squibs and muggleborns out of hogwartslets think said ron in mock puzzlement who do we know whothinks muggleborns are scumhe looked at hermione hermione looked back unconvincedif youre talking about malfoy of course i am said ron you heard him youll be nextmudbloods come on youve only got to look at his foul rat face toknow its him malfoy the heir of slytherin said hermione skepticallylook at his family said harry closing his books too the whole lotof them have been in slytherin hes always boasting about it theycould easily be slytherins descendants his fathers definitely evilenoughthey couldve had the key to the chamber of secrets for centuriessaid ron handing it down father to son well said hermione cautiously i suppose its possible but how do we prove it said harry darklythere might be a way said hermione slowly dropping her voice stillfurther with a quick glance across the room at percy of course itwould be difficult and dangerous very dangerous wed be breakingabout fifty school rules i expect if in a month or so you feel like explaining you will let us knowwont you said ron irritablyall right said hermione coldly what wed need to do is to getinside the slytherin common room and ask malfoy a few questionswithout him realizing its usbut thats impossible harry said as ron laughedno its not said hermione all wed need would be some polyjuicepotionwhats that said ron and harry togethersnape mentioned it in class a few weeks ago dyou think weve got nothing better to do in potions than listen tosnape muttered ronit transforms you into somebody else think about it we couldchange into three of the slytherins no one would know it was usmalfoy would probably tell us anything hes probably boasting about itin the slytherin common room right now if only we could hear himthis polyjuice stuff sounds a bit dodgy to me said ron frowningwhat if we were stuck looking like three of the slytherins foreverit wears off after a while said hermione waving her handimpatiently but getting hold of the recipe will be very difficultsnape said it was in a book called moste potente potions and itsbound to be in the restricted section of the librarythere was only one way to get out a book from the restrictedsection you needed a signed note of permission from a teacherhard to see why wed want the book really said ron if wewerent going to try and make one of the potionsi think said hermione that if we made it sound as thoughwe were just interested in the theory we might stand a chance oh come on no teachers going to fall for that said rontheyd have to be really thick c hh a p t v it t nthe rogue bludgerince the disastrous episode of the pixies professor lockhart had notbrought live creatures to class instead he read passages from hisbooks to them and sometimes reenacted some of the more dramaticbits he usually picked harry to help him with these reconstructionsso far harry had been forced to play a simple transylvanian villagerwhom lockhart had cured of a babbling curse a yeti with a headcold and a vampire who had been unable to eat anything exceptlettuce since lockhart had dealt with himharry was hauled to the front of the class during their very nextdefense against the dark arts lesson this time acting a werewolf ifhe hadnt had a very good reason for keeping lockhart in a goodmood he would have refused to do itnice loud howl harry exactly and then if youll believe it ipounced like this slammed him to the floor thus with one hand imanaged to hold him down with my other iput my wand to his throat i then screwed up my remaining strengthand performed the immensely complex homorphus charm he letout a piteous moan go on harry higher than that good the furvanished the fangs shrank and he turned back into a man simpleyet effective and another village will remember me forever as thehero who delivered them from the monthly terror of werewolfattacksthe bell rang and lockhart got to his feethomework compose a poem about my defeat of the waggawagga werewolf signed copies of magical me to the author of thebest onethe class began to leave harry returned to the back of the roomwhere ron and hermione were waitingready harry mutteredwait till everyones gone said hermione nervously all right she approached lockharts desk a piece of paper clutched tightly inher hand harry and ron right behind herer professor lockhart hermione stammered i wanted to toget this book out of the library just for background reading sheheld out the piece of paper her hand shaking slightly but the thingis its in the restricted section of the library so i need a teacher tosign for it im sure it would help me understand what you say ingadding with ghouls about slowacting venomsah gadding with ghouls said lockhart taking the note fromhermione and smiling widely at her possibly my very favoritebook you enjoyed itoh yes said hermione eagerly so clever the way you trapped thatlast one with the teastrainer well im sure no one will mind me giving the best student of the yeara little extra help said lockhart warmly and he pulled out anenormous peacock quill yes nice isnt it he said misreading therevolted look on rons face i usually save it for booksigningshe scrawled an enormous loopy signature on the note and handed itback to hermioneso harry said lockhart while hermione folded the note withfumbling fingers and slipped it into her bag tomorrows the firstquidditch match of the season i believe gryffindor against slytherinis it not i hear youre a useful player i was a seeker too i wasasked to try for the national squad but preferred to dedicate my lifeto the eradication of the dark forces still if ever you feel the needfor a little private training dont hesitate to ask always happy to passon my expertise to less able players harry made an indistinct noise in his throat and then hurried off afterron and hermionei dont believe it he said as the three of them examined the signatureon the note he didnt even look at the book we wantedthats because hes a brainless git said ron but who cares wevegot what we needed he is not a brainless git said hermione shrilly as they half rantoward the libraryjust because he said you were the best student of the year they dropped their voices as they entered the muffled stillness of thelibrary madam pince the librarian was a thin irritable woman wholooked like an underfed vulturemoste potente potions she repeated suspiciously trying to take thenote from hermione but hermione wouldnt let goi was wondering if i could keep it she said breathlesslyoh come on said ron wrenching it from her grasp and thrusting itat madam pince well get you another autograph lockhartll signanything if it stands still long enoughmadam pince held the note up to the light as though determined todetect a forgery but it passed the test she stalked away between thelofty shelves and returned several minutes later carrying a large andmoldylooking book hermione put it carefully into her bag and theyleft trying not to walk too quickly or look too guiltyfive minutes later they were barricaded in moaning myrtles outoforderbathroom once again hermione had overridden rons objectionsby pointing out that it was the last place anyone in their right mindswould go so they were guaranteed some privacy moaning myrtlewas crying noisily in her stall but they were ignoring her and shethemhermione opened moste potente potions carefully and the three ofthem bent over the dampspotted pages it was clear from a glancewhy it belonged in the restricted section some of the potions hadeffects almost too gruesome to think about and there were some veryunpleasant illustrations which included a man who seemed to havebeen turned inside out and a witch sprouting several extra pairs ofarms out of her headhere it is said hermione excitedly as she found the page headed thepolyjuice potion it was decorated with drawings of people halfwaythrough transforming into other people harry sincerely hoped the artist had imagined the looks of intense pain on theirfacesthis is the most complicated potion ive ever seen said hermione asthey scanned the recipe lacewing flies leeches fluxweed andknotgrass she murmured running her finger down the list ofingredients well theyre easy enough theyre in the student storecupboardwe can help ourselves oooh look powdered horn of abicorn dont know where were going to get that shredded skin of aboomslang thatll be tricky too and of course a bit of whoever wewant to change intoexcuse me said ron sharply what dyou mean a bit of whoeverwere changing into im drinking nothing with crabbes toenails in it hermione continued as though she hadnt heard himwe dont have to worry about that yet though because we add thosebits last ron turned speechless to harry who had another worrydyou realize how much were going to have to steal hermioneshredded skin of a boomslang thats definitely not in the studentscupboard whatre we going to do break into snapes private stores idont know if this is a good idea hermione shut the book with a snapwell if you two are going to chicken out fine she said there werebright pink patches on her cheeks and her eyes were brighter thanusual i dont want to break rules you know i think threateningmuggleborns is far worse than brewing up a difficult potion but ifyou dont want to find out if its malfoy ill go straight to madam pincenow and hand the book back in i never thought id see the day when youd be persuading us tobreak rules said ron all right well do it but not toenails okayhow long will it take to make anyway said harry as hermionelooking happier opened the book againwell since the fluxweed has got to be picked at the full moon andthe lacewings have got to be stewed for twentyone days id sayitd be ready in about a month if we can get all the ingredientsa month said ron malfoy could have attacked half the mugglebornsin the school by then but hermiones eyes narroweddangerously again and he added swiftly but its the best plan wevegot so full steam ahead i sayhowever while hermione was checking that the coast was clear forthem to leave the bathroom ron muttered to harry itll be a lot lesshassle if you can just knock malfoy off his broom tomorrowharry woke early on saturday morning and lay for a while thinkingabout the coming quidditch match he was nervous mainly at thethought of what wood would say if gryffindor lost but also at theidea of facing a team mounted on the fastest racing brooms goldcould buy he had never wanted to beat slytherin so badly afterhalf an hour of lying there with his insides churning he got updressed and went down to breakfast early where he found the restof the gryffindor team huddled at the long empty table all lookinguptight and not speaking muchas eleven oclock approached the whole school started to make itsway down to the quidditch stadium it was a muggy sort of daywith a hint of thunder in the air ron and hermione came hurryingover to wish harry good luck as he entered the locker rooms theteam pulled on their scarlet gryffindor robes then sat down to listen towoods usual prematch pep talkslytherin has better brooms than us he began no point denying itbut weve got better people on our brooms weve trained harder thanthey have weve been flying in all weathers too true mutteredgeorge weasley i havent been properly dry since august andwere going to make them rue the day they let that little bit of slimemalfoy buy his way onto their teamchest heaving with emotion wood turned to harryitll be down to you harry to show them that a seeker has to havesomething more than a rich father get to that snitch before malfoy ordie trying harry because weve got to win today weve got toso no pressure harry said fred winking at himas they walked out onto the pitch a roar of noise greeted them mainlycheers because ravenclaw and hufflepuff were anxious to seeslytherin beaten but the slytherins in the crowd made their boos andhisses heard too madam hooch the quidditch teacher asked flintand wood to shake hands which they did giving each otherthreatening stares and gripping rather harder than was necessaryon my whistle said madam hooch three two one with a roar from the crowd to speed them upward the fourteenplayers rose toward the leaden sky harry flew higher than any ofthem squinting around for the snitchall right there scarhead yelled malfoy shooting underneath him asthough to show off the speed of his broomharry had no time to reply at that very moment a heavy blackbludger came pelting toward him he avoided it so narrowly that hefelt it ruffle his hair as it passedclose one harry said george streaking past him with his club in hishand ready to knock the bludger back toward a slytherin harry sawgeorge give the bludger a powerful whack in the direction of adrianpucey but the bludger changed direction in midair and shot straightfor harry againharry dropped quickly to avoid it and george managed to hit it hardtoward malfoy once again the bludger swerved like a boomerangand shot at harrys headharry put on a burst of speed and zoomed toward the other end of thepitch he could hear the bludger whistling along behind him whatwas going on bludgers never concentrated on one player like this itwas their job to try and unseat as many people as possible fred weasley was waiting for the bludger at the other end harryducked as fred swung at the bludger with all his might the bludgerwas knocked off coursegotcha fred yelled happily but he was wrong as though it wasmagnetically attracted to harry the bludger pelted after him oncemore and harry was forced to fly off at full speedit had started to rain harry felt heavy drops fall onto his facesplattering onto his glasses he didnt have a clue what was going onin the rest of the game until he heard lee jordan who wascommentating say slytherin lead sixty points to zero the slytherins superior brooms were clearly doing their jobs andmeanwhile the mad bludger was doing all it could to knock harryout of the air fred and george were now flying so close to him oneither side that harry could see nothing at all except their flailing armsand had no chance to look for the snitch let alone catch itsomeones tampered with this bludger fred gruntedswinging his bat with all his might at it as it launched a new attack onharrywe need time out said george trying to signal to wood and stopthe bludger breaking harrys nose at the same timewood had obviously got the message madam hoochs whistle rangout and harry fred and george dived for the ground still trying toavoid the mad bludgerwhats going on said wood as the

ownthe rain was falling more heavily now on madam hoochs whistleharry kicked hard into the air and heard the telltale whoosh of thebludger behind him higher and higher harry climbed he looped andswooped spiraled zigzagged and rolled slightly dizzy he neverthelesskept his eyes wide open rain was speckling his glasses and ran up hisnostrils as he hung upside down avoiding another fierce dive from thebludger he could hear laughter from the crowd he knew he mustlook very stupid but the rogue bludger was heavy and couldnt changedirection as quickly as harry could he began a kind of rollercoasterride around theedges of the stadium squinting through the silver sheets of rain to thegryffindor goal posts where adrian pucey was trying to get pastwooda whistling in harrys ear told him the bludger had just missed himagain he turned right over and sped in the opposite directiontraining for the ballet potter yelled malfoy as harry was forced todo a stupid kind of twirl in midair to dodge the bludger and he fled thebludger trailing a few feet behind him and then glaring back atmalfoy in hatred he saw it the golden snitch it was hovering inchesabove malfoys left ear and malfoy busy laughing at harry hadntseen itfor an agonizing moment harry hung in midair not daring to speedtoward malfoy in case he looked up and saw the snitchwhamhe had stayed still a second too long the bludger had hit him at lastsmashed into his elbow and harry felt his arm break dimly dazed bythe searing pain in his arm he slid sideways on his raindrenchedbroom one knee still crooked over it his right arm dangling useless athis side the bludger came pelting back for a second attack this timewming at his face harry swerved out of the way one idea firmlylodged in his numb brain get to malfoythrough a haze of rain and pain he dived for the shimmering sneeringface below him and saw its eyes widen with fear malfoy thoughtharry was attacking himwhat the he gasped careening out of harrys wayharry took his remaining hand off his broom and made a wild snatchhe felt his fingers close on the cold snitch but was now onlygripping the broom with his legs and there was a yell from the crowdbelow as he headed straight for the ground trying hard not to passoutwith a splattering thud he hit the mud and rolled off his broom hisarm was hanging at a very strange angle riddled with pain he heardas though from a distance a good deal of whistling and shouting hefocused on the snitch clutched in his good handaha he said vaguely weve wonand he faintedhe came around rain falling on his face still lying on the field withsomeone leaning over him he saw a glitter of teethoh no not you he moaneddoesnt know what hes saying said lockhart loudly to the anxiouscrowd of gryffindors pressing

fred andgeorge weasley wrestling the rogue bludger into a box it was stillputting up a terrific fightstand back said lockhart who was rolling up his jadegreensleevesno dont said harry weakly but lockhart was twirling his wandand a second later had directed it straight at harrys arma strange and unpleasant sensation started at harrys shoulder andspread all the way down to his fingertips it felt as though his arm wasbeing deflated he didnt dare look at what was happening he hadshut his eyes his face turned away from his arm but his worst fearswere realized as the people above him gasped and colin creeveybegan clicking away madly his arm didnt hurt anymore nor did itfeel remotely like an armah said lockhart yes well that can sometimes happen but thepoint is the bones are no longer broken thats the thing to bear inmind so harry just toddle up to the hospital wing ah mr weasleymiss granger would you escort him and madam pomfrey will beable to er tidy you up a bitas harry got to his feet he felt strangely lopsided taking a deepbreath he looked down at his right side what he saw nearly made himpass out againpoking out of the end of his robes was what looked like a thick fleshcoloredrubber glove he tried to move his fingers nothing happenedlockhart hadnt mended harrys bones he had removed themmadam pomfrey wasnt at all pleasedyou should have come straight to me she raged holding upthe sad limp remainder of what half an hour before had been aworking arm i can mend bones in a second but growing them back you will be able to wont you said harry desperatelyill be

eyes on the dark doorway to the hospital wing as thefootsteps drew nearernext moment dumbledore was backing into the dormitory wearing along woolly dressing gown and a nightcap he was carrying one endof what looked like a statue professor mcgonagall appeared asecond later carrying its feet together they heaved it onto a bedget madam pomfrey whispered dumbledore and professormcgonagall hurried past the end of harrys bed out of sight harry layquite still pretending to be asleep he heard urgent voices and thenprofessor mcgonagall swept back into view closely followed bymadam pomfrey who was pulling a cardigan on over her nightdresshe heard a sharp intake of breathwhat happened madam pomfrey whispered to dumbledorebending over the statue on the bedlanother attack said dumbledore minerva found him on the stairsthere was a bunch of grapes next to him said professormcgonagall we think he was trying to sneak up here to visit potterharrys stomach gave a horrible lurch slowly and carefully he raisedhimself a few inches so he could look at the statue on the bed a rayof moonlight lay across its staring faceit was colin creevey his eyes were wide and his hands were stuckup in front of him holding his camerapetrified whispered madam pomfreyyes said professor mcgonagall but i shudder to think if albushadnt been on the way downstairs for hot chocolate who knowswhat might have the three of

eagerlydumbledore didnt answer he opened the back of the cameragood gracious said madam pomfreya jet of steam had hissed out of the camera harry three beds awaycaught the acrid smell of burnt

clapped a hand to her mouth professor mcgonagallstared at dumbledorebut albus surely whothe question is not who said dumbledore his eyes on colinthe question is how and from what harry could see of professor mcgonagalls shadowy face she didnt understand this any better than he didc hh a p t t r eleventhe dkjeling clijibharry woke up on sunday morning to find the dormitory blazing withwinter sunlight and his arm reboned but very stiff he sat up quicklyand looked over at colins bed but it had been blocked from view bythe high curtains harry had changed behind yesterday seeing that hewas

finished eating you may leaveharry dressed as quickly as he could and hurried off to gryffindortower desperate to tell ron and hermione about colin and dobbybut they werent there harry left to look

straight for moaning myrtles bathroom he couldnt see whyron and hermione would be in there again but after making surethat neither filch nor any prefects were around he opened the doorand heard their voices coming from a locked stallits me he said closing the door behind him there was a clunk asplash and a gasp from within the stall and he saw hermiones eyepeering through the keyholeharry she said you gave us such a fright come in hows yourarmfine said harry squeezing into the stall an old cauldron wasperched on the toilet and a crackling from under the rim told harrythey had lit a fire beneath

though i want to know how come nobodysnoticed it sneaking around the schoolmaybe it can make itself invisible said hermione prodding leeches tothe bottom of the cauldron or maybe it can disguise itself pretend tobe a suit of armor or something ive read about chameleon ghouls you read too much hermione said ron pouring dead lacewings ontop of the leeches he crumpled up the empty lacewing bag and lookedat harryso dobby stopped us from getting on the train and broke yourarm he shook his head you know what harry if he doesntstop trying to save your life hes going to kill youthe news that colin creevey had been attacked and was now lyingas though dead in the hospital wing had spread through the entireschool by monday morning the air was suddenly thick with rumorand suspicion the first

harry felt that fred and george were going thewrong way about cheering her up they were taking turns coveringthemselves with fur or boils and jumping out at her from behindstatues they only stopped when percy apoplectic with rage toldthem he was going to write to mrs weasley and tell her ginny washaving nightmaresmeanwhile hidden from the teachers a roaring trade in talismansamulets and other protective devices was sweeping the schoolneville longbottom bought a large evilsmelling green onion apointed purple crystal and a rotting newt tail before the othergryffindor boys pointed out that he

professor mcgonagall camearound as usual collecting names of those who would be staying atschool for christmas harry ron and hermione signed her list theyhad heard that malfoy was staying which struck them as verysuspicious the holidays would be the perfect time to use thepolyjuice potion and try to worm a confession out of himunfortunately the potion was only half finished they stillneeded the bicorn horn and the boomslang skin and the only placethey were going to get them was from snapes private stores harryprivately felt hed rather face slytherins legendary monster than letsnape catch him

and jars of ingredients snape prowled through the fumesmaking waspish remarks about the gryffindors work while theslytherins sniggered appreciatively draco malfoy who was snapesfavorite student kept flicking pufferfish eyes at ron and harry whoknew that if they retaliated they would get detention faster than youcould say unfairharrys swelling solution was far too runny but he had his mind onmore important things he was waiting for hermiones signal and hehardly listened as snape paused to sneer at his waterypotion when snape turned and walked off to bully neville hermionecaught harrys eye and noddedharry ducked swiftly down behind his cauldron pulled one of fredsfilibuster fireworks out of his pocket and gave it a quick prod with hiswand the firework began to fizz and sputter knowing he

swelling solution hit them malfoy got a faceful andhis nose began to swell like a balloon goyle blundered around hishands over his eyes which had expanded to the size of a dinner plate snape was trying to restore calm and find out what had happenedthrough the confusion harry saw hermione slip quietly into snapesofficesilence silence snape roared anyone who has been splashedcome here for a deflating draft when i find out who did this harry tried not to laugh as he watched malfoy hurry forward his headdrooping with the weight of a nose like a small melon as half theclass lumbered up to snapes desk some weighted down with armslike clubs others unable to talk through gigantic puffedup lips harrysaw hermione slide back into the dungeon the front of her robesbulgingwhen everyone had taken a swig of antidote and the various swellingshad subsided snape swept over to goyles cauldron and scooped outthe twisted black remains of the firework there was a sudden hushif i ever find out who threw this snape whispered i shall makesure that person is expelledharry arranged his face into what he hoped was a puzzledexpression snape was looking right at him and the bell that rang tenminutes later could not have been more welcomehe knew it was me harry told ron and hermione as they hurriedback to moaning myrtles bathroom i could tellhermione threw the new ingredients into the cauldron and began tostir feverishlyitll be ready in two weeks she said happilysnape cant prove it was you said ron reassuringly to harrywhat can he doknowing snape something foul said harry as the

goharry and hermione were all for it so at eight oclock thatevening they hurried back to the great hall the long dining tableshad vanished and a golden stage had appeared along one wall lit bythousands of candles floating overhead the ceiling was velvetyblack once more and most of the school seemed to be packedbeneath it all carrying their wands and looking excitedi wonder wholl be teaching us said hermione as they edged intothe chattering crowd someone told me flitwick was a duelingchampion when he was young maybe itll be himas long as its not harry began but he ended on a groangilderoy lockhart was walking onto the stage resplendent in robesof deep plum and accompanied by none other than snape wearinghis usual blacklockhart waved an arm for silence and called gather roundgather round can everyone see me can you all hear meexcellentnow professor dumbledore has granted me permission to startthis little dueling club to train you all in case you ever need to defendyourselves as i myself have done on countless occasions for fulldetails see my published workslet me introduce my assistant professor snape said lockhartflashing a wide smile he tells me he

master when imthrough with him never fearwouldnt it be good if they finished each other off ron muttered inharrys earsnapes upper lip was curling harry wondered why lockhartwas still smiling if snape had been looking at him like that hed havebeen running as fast as he could in the opposite directionlockhart and snape turned to face each other and bowed at leastlockhart did with much twirling of his hands whereas snape jerkedhis head irritably then they raised their wands like swords in front ofthemas you see we are holding our wands in the accepted combativeposition lockhart told the silent crowd on the count of three wewill cast our first spells neither of us will be aiming to kill of coursei wouldnt bet on that harry murmured watching snape baring histeethone two three both of them swung their wands above their heads and pointed themat their opponent snape cried expelliarmus there was a dazzlingflash of scarlet light and lockhart was blasted off his feet he flewbackward off the stage smashed into the wall and slid down it tosprawl on the floormalfoy and some of the other slytherins cheered hermione wasdancing on tiptoes do you think hes all right she squealed throughher fingerswho cares said harry and ron togetherlockhart was getting unsteadily to his feet his hat had fallen off andhis wavy hair was standing on endwell there you have it he said tottering back onto the platformthat was a disarming charm as you see ive lost my wand ahthank you miss brown yes an excellent idea to show them thatprofessor snape but if you dont mind my sayingso it was very obvious what you were about to do if i had wanted tostop you it would have been only too easy however i felt it would beinstructive to let them see snape was looking murderous possibly lockhart had noticed becausehe said enough demonstrating im going to come amongst you nowand put you all into pairs professor snape if youd like to help me they moved through the crowd matching up partners lockhartteamed neville with justin finchfletchley but snape reached harryand ron firsttime to split up the dream team i think he sneered weasley youcan partner finnigan potter harry moved automatically toward hermionei dont think so said snape smiling coldly mr malfoy come overhere lets see what you make of the famous potter and you missgranger you can partner miss bulstrodemalfoy strutted over smirking

rictusempraa jet of silver light hit malfoy in the stomach and he doubled upwheezingi said disarm only lockhart shouted in alarm over the heads of thebattling crowd as malfoy sank to his knees harry had hit him with atickling charm and he could barely move for laughing harry hungback with a vague feeling it would be unsporting to bewitch malfoywhile he was on the floor but this was a mistake gasping for breathmalfoy pointed his wand at harrys knees choked tarantallegraand the next second harrys legs began to jerk around out of hiscontrol in a kind of quickstepstop stop screamed lockhart but snape took chargefinite incantatem he shouted harrys feet stopped dancing malfoystopped laughing and they were able to look upa haze of greenish smoke was hovering over the scene both nevilleand justin were lying on the floor panting ron was holding up anashenfaced seamus apologizing for whatever his broken wand haddone but hermione and millicent bulstrode were still movingmillicent had hermione in a headlock and hermione was whimperingin pain both their wands lay forgotten on the floor harry leaptforward and pulled millicent off it was difficult she was a lot biggerthan he wasdear dear said lockhart skittering through the crowd looking atthe aftermath of the duels up you go macmillan careful there miss fawcett pinch it hard itll stop bleeding in asecond booti think id better teach you how to block unfriendly spells saidlockhart standing flustered in the midst of the hall he glanced atsnape whose black eyes glinted and looked quickly away letshave a volunteer pair longbottom and finchfletchley how aboutyou a bad idea professor lockhart said snape gliding over like a largeand malevolent bat longbottom causes devastation with the simplestspells well be sending whats left of finchfletchley up to thehospital wing in a matchbox nevilles round pink face went pinkerhow about malfoy and potter said snape with a twisted smileexcellent idea said lockhart gesturing harry and malfoy into themiddle of the hall as the crowd backed away to give them roomnow harry said lockhart when draco points his wand at youyou do thishe raised his own wand attempted a complicated sort of wigglingaction and dropped it snape smirked as lockhart quickly picked it upsaying whoops my wand is a little overexcited snape moved closer to malfoy bent down and whispered somethingin his ear malfoy smirked too harry looked up nervously at lockhartand said professor could you show me that blocking thing againscared muttered malfoy so that lockhart couldnt hear himyou wish said harry out of the corner of his mouthlockhart cuffed harry merrily on the shoulder just do what i didharrywhat drop my wandbut lockhart wasnt listeningthree two one go he shoutedmalfoy raised his wand quickly and bellowed serpensortiathe end of his wand exploded harry watched aghast as a long blacksnake shot out of it fell heavily onto the floor between them andraised itself ready to strike there were screams as the crowdbacked swiftly away clearing the floordont move potter said snape lazily clearly enjoying the sight ofharry standing motionless eye to eye with the angry snake ill getrid of it allow me shouted lockhart he brandished his wand at the snakeand there was a loud bang the snake instead of vanishing flew tenfeet into the air and fell back to the floor with a loud smack enragedhissing furiously it slithered straight toward justin finchfletchley andraised itself again fangs exposed poised to strikeharry wasnt sure what made him do it he wasnt even aware ofdeciding to do it all he knew was that his legs were carrying himforward as though he was on casters and that he had shouted stupidlyat the snake leave him alone and miraculously inexplicably thesnake slumped to the floor docile as a thick black garden hose itseyes now on harry harry felt the fear drain out of him he knew thesnake wouldnt attack anyone now though how he knew it he couldnthave explainedhe looked up at justin grinning expecting to see justin lookingrelieved or puzzled or even grateful but certainly not angry andscaredwhat do you think youre playing at he shouted and before harrycould say anything justin had turned and stormed out of the hallsnape stepped forward waved his wand and the snake vanished in asmall puff of black smoke snape too was looking at harry in anunexpected way it was a shrewd and calculating look and harrydidnt like it he was also dimly aware of an ominous muttering allaround the walls then he felt a tugging on the back of his robescome on said rods voice in his ear move come on ron steered him out of the hall hermione hurrying alongside them asthey went through the doors the people on either side drew away asthough they were frightened of catching something harry didnt havea clue what was going on and neither ron nor hermione explainedanything until they had dragged him all the way up to the emptygryffindor common room then ron pushed harry into an armchairand said youre a parselmouth why didnt you tell usim a what said harrya parselmouth said ron you can talk to snakesi know said harry i mean thats only the second time ive everdone it i

had died harry couldnt see what was so terribledyou want to tell me whats wrong with stopping a massive snakebiting off justins head he said what does it matter how i did it aslong as justin doesnt have to join the headless huntit matters said hermione speaking at last in a hushed voicebecause being able to talk to snakes was what salazar slytherin wasfamous for thats why the symbol of slytherin house is a serpentharrys mouth fell openexactly said ron and now the whole schools going to think yourehis greatgreatgreatgreatgrandson or something but im not said harry with a panic he couldnt quite explainyoull find that hard to prove said hermione he lived about athousand years ago for all we know you could beil harry lay awake for hours that night through a gap in the curtainsaround his fourposter he watched snow starting to drift past thetower window and wondered could he be a descendant of salazar slithering he didnt knowanything about his fathers family after all the dursleys had alwaysforbidden questions about his wizarding relativesquietly harry tried to say something in parseltongue the wordswouldnt come it seemed he had to be facetoface with a snake todo itbut im in gryffindor harry thought the sorting hat wouldnthave put me in here if i had slytherin bloodah said a nasty little voice in his brain but the sorting hat wanted toput you in slytherin dont you rememberharry turned over hed see justin the next day in herbology and hedexplain that hed been calling the snake off not egging it on which hethought angrily pummeling his pillow any fool should have realizedby next morning however the snow that had begun in the night hadturned into a blizzard so thick that the last herbology lesson of theterm was canceled professor sprout wanted to fit socks and scarveson the mandrakes a tricky operation she would entrust to no one elsenow that it was so important for the mandrakes to grow quickly andrevive mrs norris and colin creeveyharry fretted about this next to the fire in the gryffindor commonroom while ron and hermione used their time off to play a game ofwizard chessfor heavens sake harry said hermione exasperated as oneof rons bishops wrestled her knight off his horse and dragged him offthe board go and find justin if its so important to youso harry got up and left through the portrait hole wondering wherejustin might bethe castle was darker than it usually was in daytime because of thethick swirling gray snow at every window shivering harry walkedpast classrooms where lessons were taking place catching snatches ofwhat was happening within professor mcgonagall was shouting atsomeone who by the sound of it had turned his friend into a badgerresisting the urge to take a look harry walked on by thinking thatjustin might be using his free time to catch up on some work anddeciding to check the library firsta group of the hufliepuffs who should have been in herbology wereindeed sitting at the back of the library but they didnt seem to beworking between the long lines of high bookshelves harry could seethat their heads were close together and they were having what lookedlike an absorbing conversation he couldnt see whether justin wasamong them he was walking toward them when something of whatthey were saying met his ears and he paused to listen hidden in theinvisibility sectionso anyway a stout boy was saying i told justin to hide up in ourdormitory i mean to say if potters marked him down as his nextvictim its best if he keeps a low profile for a while of course justinsbeen waiting for something like this to happen ever since he let slip topotter he was muggleborn justin actually told him hed been downfor eton thats not the kind of thing you bandy about with slytherinsheir on the loose is ityou definitely think it is potter then ernie said a girl with blondepigtails anxiouslyhannah said the stout boy solemnly hes a parselmouth everyoneknows thats the mark of a dark wizard have you ever heard of adecent one who could talk to snakes they called slytherin himselfserpenttonguethere was some heavy murmuring at this and ernie went onremember what was written on the wall enemies of the heirbeware potter had some sort of runin with filch next thing weknow flichs cats attacked that first year creevey was annoyingpotter at the quidditch match taking pictures of him while he waslying in the mud next thing we know creeveys been attackedhe always seems so nice though said hannah uncertainly andwell hes the one who made youknowwho disappear he cant beall bad can heernie lowered his voice mysteriously the hufflepuffs bent closer andharry edged nearer so that he could catch ernies wordsno one knows how he survived that attack by youknowwho imean to say he was only a baby when it happened he should havebeen blasted into smithereens only a really powerful dark wizardcould have survived a curse like that he dropped his voice until itwas barely more than a whisper and said thats probably why youknowwho wanted to kill him in the first place didnt want anotherdark lord competing with him i wonder what other powers pottersbeen hidingharry couldnt take anymore clearing his throat loudly he stepped outfrom behind the bookshelves if he hadnt been feeling so angry hewould have found the sight that greeted him funny every one of thehufflepuffs looked as though they had been petrified by the sight ofhim and the color was draining out of ernies facehello said harry im looking for justin finchfletchleythe hufepuffs worst fears had clearly been confirmed they alllooked fearfully at erniewhat do you want with him said ernie in a quavering voicei wanted to tell him what really happened with that snake at thedueling club said harryernie bit his white lips and then taking a deep breath said wewere all there we saw what happenedthen you noticed that after i spoke to it the snake backed offsaid harryall i saw said ernie stubbornly though he was trembling as hespoke was you speaking parseltongue and chasing the snaketoward justin i didnt chase it at him harry said his voice shaking with anger itdidnt even touch himit was a very near miss said ernie and in case youre gettingideas he added hastily i might tell you that you can trace myfamily back through nine generations of witches and warlocks andmy bloods as pure as anyones so cc i dont care what sort of blood youve got said harry fiercelywhy would i want to attack mugglebornsive heard you hate those muggles you live with said ernie swiftlyits not possible to live with the dursleys and not hate them saidharry id like to see you try ithe turned on his heel and stormed out of the library earning himselfa reproving glare from madam pince who was polishing the gildedcover of a large spellbookharry blundered up the corridor barely noticing where he was goinghe was in such a fury the result was that he walked into somethingvery large and solid which knocked him backward onto the flooroh hello hagrid harry said looking uphagrids face was entirely hidden by a woolly snowcoveredbalaclava but it couldnt possibly be anyone else as he filled most ofthe corridor in his moleskin overcoat a dead rooster was hangingfrom one of his massive gloved handsall righ harry he said pulling up the balaclava so he couldspeak why arent yeh in classcanceled said harry getting up whatre you doing in herehagrid held up the limp roostersecond one killed this term he explained its either foxes or abloodsuckin bugbear an i need the headmasters permission terput a charm around the hen coophe peered more closely at harry from under his thick snowfleckedeyebrowsyeh sure yehre all righ yeh look all hot an bothered harry couldnt bring himself to repeat what ernie and the rest of thehufflepuffs had been saying about himits nothing he said id better get going hagrid its transfigurationnext and ive got to pick up my bookshe walked off his mind still full of what ernie had said about himjustins been waiting for something like this to happen ever since helet slip to potter he was muggleborn il harry stamped up the stairs and turned along another corridorwhich was particularly dark the torches had been extinguished by astrong icy draft that was blowing through a loose windowpane hewas halfway down the passage when he tripped headlong oversomething lying on the floorhe turned to squint at what hed fallen over and felt as though hisstomach had dissolvedjustin finchfletchley was lying on the floor rigid and cold a look ofshock frozen on his face his eyes staring blankly at the ceiling andthat wasnt all next to him was another figure the strangest sightharry had ever seenit was nearly headless nick no longer pearlywhite andtransparent but black and smoky floating immobile and horizontalsix inches off the floor his head was half off and his face wore anexpression of shock identical to justinsharry got to his feet his breathing fast and shallow his heart doing akind of drumroll against his ribs he looked wildly up and down thedeserted corridor and saw a line of spiders scuttling as fast as theycould away from the bodies the only sounds were the muffledvoices of teachers from the classes on either sidehe could run and no one would ever know he had been there buthe couldnt just leave them lying here he had to get help would anyone believe he hadnt had anything to do with thisas he stood there panicking a door right next to him opened with abang peeves the poltergeist came shooting outwhy its potty wee potter cackled peeves knocking harrysglasses askew as he bounced past him whats potter up to whyspotter lurking peeves stopped halfway through a midair somersault upside downhe spotted justin and nearly headless nick he flipped the rightway up filled his lungs and before harry could stop him screamedattack attack another attack no mortalor ghost is safe run for your livesattaaaackcrash crash crash door after door flew open along the corridorand people flooded out for several long minutes there was a sceneof such confusion that justin was in danger of being squashed andpeople kept standing in nearly headless nick harry found himselfpinned against the wall as the teachers shouted for quiet professormcgonagall came running followed by her own class one of whomstill had blackandwhitestriped hair she used her wand to set offaloud bang which restored silence and ordered everyone back intotheir classes no sooner had the scene cleared somewhat than erniethe hufflepuff arrived panting on the scenecaught in the act ernie yelled his face stark white pointing hisfinger dramatically at harrythat will do macmillan said professor mcgonagall sharplypeeves was bobbing overhead now grinning wickedly surveying thescene peeves always loved chaos as the teachers bent over justinand nearly headless nick examining them peeves broke into songoh potter you rotter oh what have you doneyoure killing off students you think its good fun thats enough peeves barked professor mcgonagall and peeveszoomed away backward with his tongue out at harryjustin was carried up to the hospital wing by professor flitwick andprofessor sinistra of the astronomy department but nobody seemedto know what to do for nearly headless nick in the end professormcgonagall conjured a large fan out of thin air which she gave toernie with instructions to waft nearly headless nick up the stairsthis ernie did fanning nick along like a silent black hovercraft thisleft harry and professor mcgonagall alone togetherthis way potter she saidprofessor said harry at once i swear i didnt this is out of my hands potter said professor mcgonagall curtlythey marched in silence around a corner and she stopped before alarge and extremely ugly stone gargoylelemon drop she said this was evidently a password because thegargoyle sprang suddenly to life and hopped aside as the wall behindhim split in two even full of dread for what was coming harrycouldnt fail to be amazed behind the wall was a spiral staircase thatwas moving smoothly upward like an escalator as he and professormcgonagall stepped onto it harry heard the wall thud closed behindthem they rose upward in circles higher and higher until at lastslightly dizzy harry saw a gleaming oak door ahead with a brassknocker in the shape of a griffinhe knew now where he was being taken this must be wheredumbledore livedc i a p t v rr t w e i vthe polyjuice potionhey stepped off the stone staircase at the top and professormcgonagall rapped on the door it opened silently and they enteredprofessor mcgonagall told harry to wait and left him there aloneharry looked around one thing was certain of all the teachersoffices harry had visited so far this year dumbledores was by farthe most interesting if he hadnt been scared out of his wits that hewas about to be thrown out of school he would have been verypleased to have a chance to look around itit was a large and beautiful circular room full of funny little noises anumber of curious silver instruments stood on spindlelegged tableswhirring and emitting little puffs of smoke the walls were coveredwith portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses all of whomwere snoozing gently in their frames there was also an enormousclawfooted desk and sitting on a shelf behind it a shabby tatteredwizards hat the sorting hatharry hesitated he cast a wary eye around the sleeping witches andwizards on the walls surely it couldnt hurt if he took the hat downand tried it on again just to see just to make sure it had put him inthe right househe walked quietly around the desk lifted the hat from its shelf andlowered it slowly onto his head it was much too large and slippeddown over his eyes just as it had done the last time hed put it onharry stared at the black inside of the hat waiting then a small voicesaid in his ear bee in your bonnet harry potterer yes harry muttered er sorry to bother you i wanted to ask youve been wondering whether i put you in the right house saidthe hat smartly yes you were particularly difficult to place but istand by what i said before harrys heart leapt you would havedone well in slytherin harrys stomach plummeted he grabbed the point of the hat andpulled it off it hung limply in his hand grubby and faded harrypushed it back onto its shelf feeling sickyoure wrong he said aloud to the still and silent hat it didnt moveharry backed away watching it then a strange gagging noise behindhim made him wheel aroundhe wasnt alone after all standing on a golden perch behind the doorwas a decrepitlooking bird that resembled a halfplucked turkeyharry stared at it and the bird looked balefully back making itsgagging noise again harry thought it looked very ill its eyes were dulland even as harry watched a couple more feathers fell out of its tailharry was just thinking that all he needed was for dumbledorespet bird to die while he was alone in the office with it when the birdburst into flamesharry yelled in shock and backed away into the desk he lookedfeverishly around in case there was a glass of water somewhere butcouldnt see one the bird meanwhile had become a fireball it gaveone loud shriek and next second there was nothing but a smoulderingpile of ash on the floorthe office door opened dumbledore came in looking very somberprofessor harry gasped your bird i couldnt do anything he justcaught fire to harrys astonishment dumbledore smiledabout time too he said hes been looking dreadful for days ivebeen telling him to get a move onhe chuckled at the stunned look on harrys facefawkes is a phoenix harry phoenixes burst into flame when it istime for them to die and are reborn from the ashes watch him harry looked down in time to see a tiny wrinkled newborn bird pokeits head out of the ashes it was quite as ugly as the old oneits a shame you had to see him on a burning day said dumbledoreseating himself behind his desk hes really very handsome most ofthe time wonderful red and gold plumage fascinating creaturesphoenixes they can carry immensely heavy loads their tears havehealing powers and they make highly faithful petsin the shock of fawkes catching fire harry had forgotten what hewas there for but it all came back to him as dumbledore settledhimself in the high chair behind the desk and fixed harry with hispenetrating lightblue starebefore dumbledore could speak another word however the door ofthe office flew open with an almighty bang and hagrid burst in a wildlook in his eyes his balaclava perched on top of his shaggy black headand the dead rooster still swinging from his handit wasn harry professor dumbledore said hagrid urgently i wastalkin ter him seconds before that kid was found he never had time sir dumbledore tried to say something but hagrid went ranting onwaving the rooster around in his agitation sending featherseverywhereit cantve bin him ill swear it in front o the ministry o magic if ihave to hagrid i yehve got the wrong boy sir i know harry never hagrid said dumbledore loudly i do not think that harryattacked those peopleoh said hagrid the rooster falling limply at his side right ill waitoutside then headmasterand he stomped out looking embarrassedyou dont think it was me professor harry repeated hopefully asdumbledore brushed rooster feathers off his deskno harry i dont said dumbledore though his face was somberagain but i still want to talk to youharry waited nervously while dumbledore considered him the tips ofhis long fingers togetheri must ask you harry whether there is anything youd like to tell mehe said gently anything at allharry didnt know what to say he thought of malfoy shouting youllbe next mudbloods and of the polyjuice potion simmering away inmoaning myrtles bathroom then he thought of the disembodiedvoice he had heard twice and remembered what ron had saidhearing voices no one else can hear isnt a good sign even in thewizarding world he thought too about what everyone was sayingabout him and his growing dread that he was somehow connectedwith salazar slytherin no said harry there isnt anything professor the double attack on justin and nearly headless nick turned whathad hitherto been nervousness into real panic curiously it was nearlyheadless nicks fate that seemed to worry people most what couldpossibly do that to a ghost people asked each other what terriblepower could harm someone who was already dead there wasalmost a stampede to book seats on the hogwarts express so thatstudents could go home for christmasat this rate well be the only ones left ron told harry andhermione us malfoy crabbe and goyle what a jolly holiday itsgoing to becrabbe and goyle who always did whatever malfoy did had signedup to stay over the holidays too but harry was glad that most peoplewere leaving he was tired of people skirting around him in thecorridors as though he was about to sprout fangs or spit poison tiredof all the muttering pointing and hissing as he passedfred and george however found all this very funny they went out oftheir way to march ahead of harry down the corridors shoutingmake way for the heir of slytherin seriously evil wizard comingthrough percy was deeply disapproving of this behaviorit is not a laughing matter he said coldlyoh get out of the way percy said fred harrys in a hurryyeah hes off to the chamber of secrets for a cup of tea with hisfanged servant said george chortlingginny didnt find it amusing eitheroh dont she wailed every time fred asked harry loudly who hewas planning to attack next or when george pretended to ward harryoff with a large clove of garlic when they metharry didnt mind it made him feel better that fred and george atleast thought the idea of his being slytherins heir was quite ludicrousbut their antics seemed to be aggravating draco malfoy who lookedincreasingly sour each time he saw them at itits because hes bursting to say its really him said ron knowinglyyou know how he hates anyone beating him at anything and youregetting all the credit for his dirty worknot for long said hermione in a satisfied tone the polyjuicepotions nearly ready well be getting the truth out of him any daynowat last the term ended and a silence deep as the snow on the groundsdescended on the castle harry found it peaceful rather than gloomyand enjoyed the fact that he hermione and the weasleys had the runof gryffindor tower which meant they couldplay exploding snap loudly without bothering anyone and practicedueling in private fred george and ginny had chosen to stay atschool rather than visit bill in egypt with mr and mrs weasleypercy who disapproved of what he termed their childish behaviordidnt spend much time in the gryffindor common room he hadalready told them pompously that he was only staying over christmasbecause it was his duty as a prefect to support the teachers duringthis troubled timechristmas morning dawned cold and white harry and ron the onlyones left in their dormitory were woken very early by hermionewho burst in fully dressed and carrying presents for them bothwake up she said loudly pulling back the curtains at the windowhermione youre not supposed to be in here said ron shieldinghis eyes against the lightmerry christmas to you too said hermione throwing him hispresent ive been up for nearly an hour adding more lacewings tothe potion its readyharry sat up suddenly wide awakeare you surepositive said hermione shifting scabbers the rat so that she couldsit down on the end of rons fourposter if were going to do it isay it should be tonightat that moment hedwig swooped into the room carrying a verysmall package in her beakhello said harry happily as she landed on his bed are youspeaking to me againshe nibbled his ear in an affectionate sort of way which was a farbetter present than the one that she had brought him which turnedout to be from the dursleys they had sent harry a toothpick and anote telling him to find out whether hed be able to stay at hogwartsfor the summer vacation toothe rest of harrys christmas presents were far more satisfactoryhagrid had sent him a large tin of treacle fudge which harry decidedto soften by the fire before eating ron had given him a book calledflying with the cannons a book of interesting facts about his favoritequidditch team and hermione had bought him a luxury eaglefeatherquill harry opened the last present to find a new handknittedsweater from mrs weasley and a large plum cake he read her cardwith a fresh surge of guilt thinking about mr weasleys car whichhadnt been seen since its crash with the whomping willow and thebout of rulebreaking he and ron were planning nextno one not even someone dreading taking polyjuice potion latercould fail to enjoy christmas dinner at hogwartsthe great hall looked magnificent not only were there a dozenfrostcovered christmas trees and thick streamers of holly andmistletoe crisscrossing the ceiling but enchanted snow was fallingwarm and dry from the ceiling dumbledore led them in a few of hisfavorite carols hagrid booming more and more loudly with everygoblet of eggnog he consumed percy who hadnt noticed that fredhad bewitched his prefect badge so that it now read pinhead keptasking them all what they were sniggering at harry didnt even carethat draco malfoy was making loud snide remarksl about his new sweater from the slytherin table with a bit of luckmalfoy would be getting his comeuppance in a few hours timeharry and ron had barely finished their third helpings of christmaspudding when hermione ushered them out of the hall to finalize theirplans for the eveningwe still need a bit of the people youre changing into saidhermione matteroffacdy as though she were sending them to thesupermarket for laundry detergent and obviously itll be best if youcan get something of crabbes and goyles theyre malfoys bestfriends hell tell them anything and we also need to make sure thereal crabbe and goyle cant burst in on us while were interrogatinghimive got it all worked out she went on smoothly ignoring harrysand rons stupefied faces she held up two plump chocolate cakesive filled these with a simple sleeping draught all you have to do ismake sure crabbe and goyle find them you know how greedy theyare theyre bound to eat them once theyre asleep pull out a few oftheir hairs and hide them in a broom closetharry and ron looked incredulously at each otherhermione i dont think that could go seriously wrong but hermione had a steely glint in her eye not unlike the oneprofessor mcgonagall sometimes hadthe potion will be useless without crabbes and goyles hair shesaid sternly you do want to investigate malfoy dont youoh all right all right said harry but what about you whose hairare you ripping outive already got mine said hermione brightly pulling a tiny bottleout of her pocket and showing them the single hair inside itremember millicent bulstrode wrestling with me at the duelingclub she left this on my robes when she was trying to strangle meand shes gone home for christmas so ill just have to tell theslytherins ive decided to come backwhen hermione had bustled off to check on the polyjuice potionagain ron turned to harry with a doomladen expressionhave you ever heard of a plan where so many things could gowrongbut to harrys and rons utter amazement stage one of theoperation went just as smoothly as hermione had said they lurkedin the deserted entrance hall after christmas tea waiting for crabbeand goyle who had remained alone at the slytherin table shovelingdown fourth helpings of trifle harry had perched the chocolatecakes on the end of the banisters when they spotted crabbe andgoyle coming out of the great hall harry and ron hid quicklybehind a suit of armor next to the front doorhow thick can you get ron whispered ecstatically as crabbegleefully pointed out the cakes to goyle and grabbed them grinningstupidly they stuffed the cakes whole into their large mouths for amoment both of them chewed greedily looks of triumph on theirfaces then without the smallest change of expression they bothkeeled over backward onto the floorby far the hardest part was hiding them in the closet across the hallonce they were safely stowed among the buckets and mops harryyanked out a couple of the bristles that covered goyles forehead and ron pulled out several of crabbes hairs they also stoletheir shoes because their own were far too small for crabbe andgoylesize feet then still stunned at what they had just done theysprinted up to moaning myrtles bathroomthey could hardly see for the thick black smoke issuing from the stallin which hermione was stirring the cauldron pulling their robes upover their faces harry and ron knocked softly on the doorhermionethey heard the scrape of the lock and hermione emerged shinyfacedand looking anxious behind her they heard the gloop gloopof the bubbling glutinous potion three glass tumblers stood ready onthe toilet seatdid you get them hermione asked breathlesslyharry showed her goyles hairgood and i sneaked these spare robes out of the laundry hermionesaid holding up a small sack youll need bigger sizes once yourecrabbe and goylethe three of them stared into the cauldron close up the potion lookedlike thick dark mud bubbling sluggishlyim sure ive done everything right said hermione nervouslyrereading the splotched page of moste potente potions it looks like thebook says it should once weve drunk it well have exactly an hourbefore we change back into ourselvesnow what ron whisperedwe separate it into three glasses and add the hairshermione ladled large dollops of the potion into each of the glassesthen her hand trembling she shook millicent bulstrodes hair out ofits bottle into the first glassthe potion hissed loudly like a boiling kettle and frothed madly asecond later it had turned a sick sort of yellowurgh essence of millicent bulstrode said ron eyeing it withloathing bet it tastes disgustingadd yours then said hermioneharry dropped goyles hair into the middle glass and ron put crabbesinto the last one both glasses hissed and frothed goyles turned thekhaki color of a booger crabbes a dark murky brownhang on said harry as ron and hermione reached for their glasseswed better not all drink them in here once we turn into crabbeand goyle we wont fit and millicent bulstrodes no pixiegood thinking said ron unlocking the door well take separatestallscareful not to spill a drop of his polyjuice potion harry slipped intothe middle stallready he calledready came rons and hermiones voicesone two three pinching his nose harry drank the potion down in two large gulps ittasted like overcooked cabbageimmediately his insides started writhing as though hed just swallowedlive snakes doubled up he wondered whether he was going to besick then a burning sensation spread rapidly from his stomach to thevery ends of his fingers and toes next bringing him gasping to allfours came a horrible melting feeling as the skin all over his bodybubbled like hot wax and before his eyes his hands began to growthe fingers thickened the nails broadenedthe knuckles were bulging like bolts his shoulders stretched painfullyand a prickling on his forehead told him that hair was creeping downtoward his eyebrows his robes ripped as his chest expanded like abarrel bursting its hoops his feet were agony in shoes four sizes toosmallas suddenly as it had started everything stopped harry lay facedownon the stonecold floor listening to myrtle gurgling morosely in the endtoilet with difficulty he kicked off his shoes and stood up so this waswhat it felt like being goyle his large hand trembling he pulled offhis old robes which were hanging a foot above his ankles pulled onthe spare ones and laced up goyles boatlike shoes he reached up tobrush his hair out of his eyes and met only the short growth of wirybristles low on his forehead then he realized that his glasses wereclouding his eyes because goyle obviously didnt need them he tookthem off and called are you two okay goyles low rasp of a voiceissued from his mouthyeah came the deep grunt of crabbe from his rightharry unlocked his door and stepped in front of the cracked mirrorgoyle stared back at him out of dull deepset eyes harry scratchedhis ear so did goylerons door opened they stared at each other except that he lookedpale and shocked ron was indistinguishable from crabbe from thepuddingbowl haircut to the long gorilla armsthis is unbelievable said ron approaching the mirror and proddingcrabbes flat nose unbelievable wed better get going said harry loosening the watch that wascutting into goyles thick wrist weve still got to find outwhere the slytherin common room is i only hope we can findsomeone to follow ron who had been gazing at harry said you dont know howbizarre it is to see goyle thinking he banged on hermiones doorcmon we need to go a highpitched voice

coast was clear and set offdont swing your arms like that harry muttered to ronehcrabbe holds them sort of stiff hows thisyeah thats better they went down the marble staircase all they needed now wasa slytherin that they could follow to the slytherin common room butthere was nobody aroundany ideas muttered harrythe slytherins always come up to breakfast from over there saidron nodding at the entrance to the dungeons the words had barelyleft his mouth when a girl with long curly hair emerged from theentranceexcuse me said ron hurrying up to her weve forgotten the wayto our common roomi beg your pardon said the girl stiffly our common room im aravenclawshe walked away looking suspiciously back at themharry and ron hurried down the stone steps into the darkness theirfootsteps echoing particularly loudly as crabbes and goyles hugefeet hit the floor feeling that this wasnt going to be as easy as theyhad hopedthe labyrinthine passages were deserted they walked deeper anddeeper under the school constantly checking their watches to seehow much time they had left after a quarter of an hour just whenthey were getting desperate they heard a sudden movement aheadha said ron excitedly theres one of them nowthe figure was emerging from a side room as they hurried nearerhowever their hearts sank it wasnt a slytherin it was percywhatre you doing down here said ron in surprisepercy

harryer said harryoh yeah pureblood said malfoy not listening and a stone doorconcealed in the wall slid open malfoy marched through it andharry and ron followed himthe slytherin common room was a long low underground roomwith rough stone walls and ceiling from which round greenish lampswere hanging on chains a fire was crackling under an elaboratelycarved mantelpiece ahead of them and several slytherins weresilhouetted around it in highbacked chairswait here said malfoy to harry and ron motioning them to a pairof empty chairs set back from the fire ill go and get it my fathersjust sent it to me wondering what malfoy was going to show them harry and ronsat down doing their best to look at homemalfoy came back a minute later holding what looked like anewspaper clipping he thrust it under rons nosethatll give you a laugh he saidharry saw rons eyes widen in shock he read the clipping quicklygave a very forced laugh and handed it to harryit had been clipped out of the daily prophet and it saidinquiry at the ministry of magicarthur weasley head of the misuse of muggle artifacts officewas today fined fifty galleons for bewitching a muggle carmr lucius malfoy a governor of hogwarts

hopingagainst hope that malfoy hadnt noticed anything harrycould feel his feet slipping around in goyles huge shoes and had tohoist up his robes as he shrank they crashed up the steps into the darkentrance hall which was full of a muffled pounding coming from thecloset where theyd locked crabbe and goyle leaving their shoesoutside the closet door they sprinted in their socks up the

the stairstoward gryffindor tower snape had given them so muchhomework harry thought he was likely to be in the sixth year beforehe finished it ron was just saying he wished he had asked hermionehow many rat tails you were supposed to add to a hairraisingpotion when an angry outburst from the floor above reached theirearsthats filch harry muttered as they hurried up the stairs andpaused out of sight listening hardyou dont think someone elses been attacked said ron tenselythey stood still their heads inclined toward flichs voice whichsounded quite hystericaleven more work for me mopping all night like i havent got enough todo no this is the final straw im going to dumbledore his footsteps receded along the outofsight corridor and they heard adistant door slamthey poked their heads around the corner filch had clearly beenmanning his usual lookout post they were once again on the spotwhere mrs norris had been attacked they saw at a glance whatfilch had been shouting about a great flood of water stretched overhalf the corridor and it looked as though it was still seeping fromunder the door of moaning myrtles bathroom now that filch hadstopped shouting they could hear myrtles wails echoing off thebathroom wallsnow whats up with her said ronlets go and see said harry and holding their robes over theirankles they stepped through the great wash of water to the doorbearing its out of order sign ignored it as always and enteredmoaning myrtle was crying if possible louder and harder than everbefore she seemed to be hiding down her usual toilet it was dark inthe bathroom because the candles had been extinguished in the greatrush of water that had left both walls and floor soaking wetwhats up myrtle said harrywhos that glugged myrtle miserably come to throw somethingelse at meharry waded across to her stall and said why would i throwsomething at youdont ask me myrtle shouted emerging with a wave of yet morewater which splashed onto the already sopping floor here i amminding my own business and someone thinks its funny to throw abook at me but it cant hurt you if someone throws something at you saidharry reasonably i mean itd just go right through you wouldntithe had said the wrong thing myrtle puffed herself up and shriekedlets all throw books at myrtle because she cant feel it ten pointsif you can get it through her stomach fifty points if it goes throughher head well ha ha ha what a lovely game i dont thinkwho threw it at you anyway asked harryi dont know i was just sitting in the ubend thinking aboutdeath and it fell right through the top of my head said myrtleglaring at them its over there it got washed out harry and ron looked under the sink where myrtle was pointing asmall thin book lay there it had a shabby black cover and was aswet as everything else in the bathroom harry stepped forward topick it up but ron suddenly flung out an arm to hold him backwhat said harryare you crazy said ron it could be dangerousdangeroussaid harry laughing come off it how could it bedangerousyoud be surprised said ron who was looking apprehensively atthe book some of the books the ministrys confiscated dads toldme there was one that burned your eyes out andeveryone who read sonnets of a sorcerer spoke in limericks for the restof their lives and some old witch in bath had a book that you couldnever stop reading you just had to wander around with your nose in ittrying to do everything onehanded and all right ive got the point said harrythe little book lay on the floor nondescript and soggywell we wont find out unless we look at it he said and he duckedaround ron and picked it up off the floorharry saw at once that it was a diary and the faded year on the covertold him it was fifty years old he opened it eagerly on the first pagehe could just make out the name t m riddle in smudged inkhang on said ron who had approached cautiously and was lookingover harrys shoulder i know that name t m riddle got anaward for special services to the school fifty years agohow on earth dyou know that said harry in amazementbecause filch made me polish his shield about fifty times indetention said ron resentfully that was the one i burped slugs allover if youd wiped slime off a name for an hour youd remember ittooharry peeled the wet pages apart they were completely blankthere wasnt the faintest trace of writing on any of them not evenauntie mabels birthday or dentist halfpast threehe never wrote in it said harry disappointedi wonder why someone wanted to flush it away said ron curiouslyharry turned to the back cover of the book and saw the printed nameof a variety store on vauxhall road londonhe mustve been muggleborn said harry thoughtfufly to havebought a diary from vauxhall road well its not much use to you said ron he dropped his voice fiftypoints if you can get it through myrtles noseharry however pocketed ithermione left the hospital wing dewhiskered tailless and furfree atthe beginning of february on her first evening back in gryffindortower harry showed her t m riddles diary and told her the storyof how they had found itoooh it might have hidden powers said hermione enthusiasticallytaking the diary and looking at it closelyif it has its hiding them very well said ron maybe its shy i dontknow why you dont chuck it harryi wish i knew why someone did try to chuck it said harry iwouldnt mind knowing how riddle got an award for special servicesto hogwarts eithercouldve been anything said ron maybe he got thirty owls orsaved a teacher from the giant squid maybe he murdered myrtle thatwouldve done everyone a favor but harry could tell from the arrested look on hermiones face thatshe was thinking what he was thinkingwhat said ron looking from one to the otherwell the chamber of secrets was opened fifty years ago wasnt ithe said thats what malfoy saidyeah said ron slowlyand this diary is fifty years old said hermione tapping it excitedlya sooh ron wake up snapped hermione we know the person whoopened the chamber last time was expelled fifty years ago we knowt m riddle got an award for special services to the school fifty yearsago well what if riddle got his special award for catching the heir ofslytherin his diary would probably tell us everything where thechamber is and how to open it and what sort of creature lives in it the person whos behind the attacks this time wouldnt want that lyingaround would theythats a brilliant theory hermione said ron with just one tiny littleflaw theres nothing written in his diarybut hermione was pulling her wand out of her bagit might be invisible ink she whisperedshe tapped the diary three times and said apareciumnothing happened undaunted hermione shoved her hand back intoher bag and pulled out what appeared to be a bright red eraserits a revealer i got it in diagon alley she saidshe rubbed hard on january first nothing happenedim telling you theres nothing to find in there said ron riddle justgot a diary for christmas and couldnt be bothered filling it inharry couldnt explain even to himself why he didnt just throwriddles diary away the fact was that even though he knew the diarywas blank he kept absentmindedly picking it up and turning the pagesas though it were a story he wanted to finish and while harry wassure he had never heard the name t m riddle before it still seemedto mean something to him almost as thoughriddle was a friend hed had when he was very small and hadhalfforgotten but this was absurd hed never had friends beforehogwarts dudley had made sure of thatnevertheless harry was determined to find out more about riddle sonext day at break he headed for the trophy room to examine riddlesspecial award accompanied by an interested hermione and athoroughly unconvinced ron who told them hed seen enough of thetrophy room to last him a lifetimeriddles burnished gold shield was tucked away in a corner cabinet itdidnt carry details of why it had been given to him good thing tooor itd be even bigger and id still be polishing it said ron howeverthey did find riddles name on an old medal for magical merit and ona list of old head boyshe sounds like percy said ron wrinkling his nose in disgustprefect head boy probably top of every class you say that like its a bad thing said hermione in a slightly hurtvoicethe sun had now begun to shine weakly on hogwarts again insidethe castle the mood had grown more hopeful there had been nomore attacks since those on justin and nearly headless nick andmadam pomfrey was pleased to report that the mandrakes werebecoming moody and secretive meaning that they were fast leavingchildhoodthe moment their acne clears up theyll be ready for repotting againharry heard her telling filch kindly one afternoon and after that itwont be long until were cutting them up and stewing them youllhave mrs norris back in no timeperhaps the heir of slytherin had lost his or her nerve thought harryit must be getting riskier and riskier to open the chamber of secretswith the school so alert and suspicious perhaps the monsterwhatever it was was even now settling itself down to hibernate foranother fifty years ernie macmillan of hufflepuff didnt take this cheerful view he wasstill convinced that harry was the guilty one that he had givenhimself away at the dueling club peeves wasnt helping matters hekept popping up in the crowded corridors singing oh potter yourotter now with a dance routine to matchgilderoy lockhart seemed to think he himself had made the attacksstop harry overheard him telling professor mcgonagall so while thegryffindors were lining up for transfigurationi dont think therell be any more trouble minerva he said tappinghis nose knowingly and winking i think the chamber has been lockedfor good this time the culprit must have known it was only a matterof time before i caught him rather sensible to stop now before icame down hard on himyou know what the school needs now is a moralebooster washaway the memories of last term i wont say any more just now but ithink i know just the thing he tapped his nose again and strode offlockharts idea of a moralebooster became clear at breakfast time onfebruary fourteenth harry hadnt had much sleep because of a laterunningquidditch practice the night before and he hurried down tothe great hall slightly late he thought for a moment that hedwalked through the wrong doorsthe walls were all covered with large lurid pink flowers worsestill heartshaped confetti was falling from the pale blue ceiling harrywent over to the gryffindor table where ron was sitting lookingsickened and hermione seemed to have been overcome with giggleswhats going on harry asked them sitting down and wiping confettioff his baconron pointed to the teachers table apparently too disgusted to speaklockhart wearing lurid pink robes to match the decorations waswaving for silence the teachers on either side of him were lookingstonyfaced from where he sat harry could see a muscle going inprofessor mcgonagalls cheek snape looked as though someone hadjust fed him a large beaker of skelegrohappy valentines day lockhart shouted and may i thank thefortysix people who have so far sent me cards yes i have taken theliberty of arranging this little surprise for you all and it doesnt endherelockhart clapped his hands and through the doors to the entrance hallmarched a dozen surlylooking dwarfs not just any dwarfs howeverlockhart had them all wearing golden wings and carrying harpsmy friendly cardcarrying cupids beamed lockhart they will beroving around the school today delivering your valentines and the fundoesnt stop here im sure my colleagues will want to enter into thespirit of the occasion why not ask professor snape to show you howto whip up a love potion and while youre at it professor flitwickknows more about entrancing enchantments than any wizard iveever met the sly old dogprofessor flitwick buried his face in his hands snape was looking as though the first person to ask him for a love potion would beforcefed poisonplease hermione tell me you werent one of the fortysix said ronas they left the great hall for their first lesson hermione suddenlybecame very interested in searching her bag for her schedule anddidnt answerall day long the dwarfs kept barging into their classes to delivervalentines to the annoyance of the teachers and late that afternoon asthe gryffindors were walking upstairs for charms one of the dwarfscaught up with harryoy you arty potter shouted a particularly grimlooking dwarfelbowing people out of the way to get to harryhot all over at the thought of being given a valentine in front of a lineof first years which happened to include ginny weasley harry triedto escape the dwarf however cut his way through the crowd bykicking peoples shins and reached him before hed gone two pacesive got a musical message to deliver to arry potter in person hesaid twanging his harp in a threatening sort of waynot here harry hissed trying to escapestay still grunted the dwarf grabbing hold of harrys bag and pullinghim backlet me go harry snarled tuggingwith a loud ripping noise his bag split in two his books wandparchment and quill spilled onto the floor and his ink bottle smashedover everythingharry scrambled around trying to pick it all up before the dwarfstarted singing causing something of a holdup in the corridorwhats going on here came the cold drawling voice of dracomalfoy harry started stuffing everything feverishly into his rippedbag desperate to get away before malfoy could hear his musicalvalentinewhats all this commotion said another familiar voice as percyweasley arrivedlosing his head harry tried to make a run for it but the dwarfseized him around the knees and brought him crashing to the floorright he said sitting on harrys ankles here is your singingvalentinehis eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toadhis hair is as dark as a blackboardi wish he was mine hes really divinethe hero who conquered the dark lordharry would have given all the gold in gringotts to evaporate on thespot trying valiantly to laugh along with everyone else he got up hisfeet numb from the weight of the dwarf as percy weasley did hisbest to disperse the crowd some of whom were crying with mirthoff you go off you go the bell rang five minutes ago off to classnow he said shooing some of the younger students away and youmalfoyharry glancing over saw malfoy stoop and snatch up somethingleering he showed it to crabbe and goyle and harry realized thathed got riddles diarygive that back said harry quietlywonder what potters written in this said malfoy who obviously hadnt noticed the year on the cover and thought he hadharrys own diary a hush fell over the onlookers ginny was staringfrom the diary to harry looking terrifiedhand it over malfoy said percy sternlywhen ive had a look said malfoy waving the diary tauntingly atharrypercy said as a school prefect but harry had lost his temper hepulled out his wand and shouted expelliarmus and just assnape had disarmed lockhart so malfoy found the diary shootingout of his hand into the air ron grinning broadly caught itharry said percy loudly no magic in the corridors ill have toreport this you knowbut harry didnt care he was oneup on malfoy and that was worthfive points from gryffindor any day malfoy was looking furious andas ginny passed him to enter her classroom he yelled spitefully afterher i dont think potter liked your valentine muchginny covered her face with her hands and ran into class snarlingron pulled out his wand too but harry pulled him away ron didntneed to spend the whole of charms belching slugsit wasnt until they had reached professor flitwicks class that harrynoticed something rather odd about riddles diary all his otherbooks were drenched in scarlet ink the diary however was asclean as it had been before the ink bottle had smashed all over it hetried to point this out to ron but ron was having trouble with hiswand again large purple bubbles were blossoming out of the endand he wasnt much interested in anything elseharry went to bed before anyone else in his dormitory that night thiswas partly because he didnt think he could stand fred and georgesinging his eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad one more timeand partly because he wanted to examine riddles diary again andknew that ron thought he was wasting his timeharry sat on his fourposter and flicked through the blank pages notone of which had a trace of scarlet ink on it then he pulled a newbottle out of his bedside cabinet dipped his quill into it and dropped ablot onto the first page of the diarythe ink shone brightly on the paper for a second and then as though itwas being sucked into the page vanished excited harry loaded uphis quill a second time and wrote my name is harry potterthe words shone momentarily on the page and they too sank withouttrace then at last something happenedoozing back out of the page in his very own ink came words harryhad never writtenhello harry potter my name is tom riddle how did you come by mydiarythese words too faded away but not before harry had started toscribble backsomeone tried to flush it down a toilethe waited eagerly for riddles replylucky that i recorded my memories in some more lasting way than inkbut i always knew that there would be those who would not want thisdiary read what do you mean harry scrawled blotting the page in hisexcitementi mean that this diary holds memories of terrible things things that werecovered up things that happened at hogwarts school of witchcraft andwizardry thats where i am now harry wrote quickly im at hogwarts andhorrible stuffs been happening do you know anything about thechamber of secretshis heart was hammering riddles reply came quickly his writingbecoming untidier as though he was hurrying to tell all he knewof course i know about the chamber of secrets in my day they told us itwas a legend that it did not exist but this was a lie in my fifth year thechamber was opened and the monster attacked several students finallykilling one i caught the person whod opened the chamber and he wasexpelled but the headmaster professor dippet ashamed that such a thinghad happened at hogwarts forbade me to tell the truth a story was givenout that thegirl had died in a freak accident they gave me a nice shinyengraved trophy for my trouble and warned me to keep my mouth shut but iknew it could happen again the monster lived on and the one who had thepower to release it was not imprisoned harry nearly upset his ink bottle in his hurry to write backits happening again now there have been three attacks and no oneseems to know whos behind them who was it last timei can show you if you like came riddles reply you dont haveto take my word for it i can take you inside my memory of the nightwhen i caught him harry hesitated his quill suspended over the diary what did riddlemean how could he be taken inside somebody elses memory heglanced nervously at the door to the dormitory which wasgrowing dark when he looked back at the diary he saw fresh wordsforminglet me show you harry paused for a fraction of a second and then wrote two letterskthe pages of the diary began to blow as though caught in a high windstopping halfway through the month of june mouth hanging openharry saw that the little square for june thirteenth seemed to haveturned into a miniscule television screen his hands trembling slightlyhe raised the book to press his eye against the little window andbefore he knew what was happening he was tilting forward thewindow was widening he felt his body leave his bed and he waspitched headfirst through the opening in the page into a whirl of colorand shadowhe felt his feet hit solid ground and stood shaking as the blurredshapes around him came suddenly into focushe knew immediately where he was this circular room with thesleeping portraits was dumbledores office but it wasnt dumbledorewho was sitting behind the desk a wizened fraillooking wizard baldexcept for a few wisps of white hair was reading a letter bycandlelight harry had never seen this man beforeim sorry he said shakily i didnt mean to butt in but the wizard didnt look up he continued to read frowning slightlyharry drew nearer to his desk and stammered er ill just go shallistill the wizard ignored him he didnt seem even to have heard himthinking that the wizard might be deaf harry raised his voicesorry i disturbed you ill go now he halfshoutedthe wizard folded up the letter with a sigh stood up walked pastharry without glancing at him and went to draw the curtains at hiswindowthe sky outside the window was rubyred it seemed to be sunsetthe wizard went back to the desk sat down and twiddled his thumbswatching the doorharry looked around the office no fawkes the phoenix no whirringsilver contraptions this was hogwarts as riddle had known itmeaning that this unknown wizard was headmaster not dumbledoreand he harry was little more than a phantom completely invisible tothe people of fifty years agothere was a knock on the office doorenter said the old wizard in a feeble voicea boy of about sixteen entered taking off his pointed hat a silverprefects badge was glinting on his chest he was much taller thanharry but he too had jetblack hairah riddle said the headmasteryou wanted to see me professor dippet said riddle he lookednervoussit down said dippet ive just been reading the letter you sent meoh said riddle he sat down gripping his hands together verytightlymy dear boy said dipper kindly i cannot possibly let you stay atschool over the summer surely you want to go home for theholidaysno said riddle at once id much rather stay at hogwarts than goback to that to that you live in a muggle orphanage during the holidays i believe saiddippet curiouslyyes sir said riddle reddening slightlyyou are mugglebornhalfblood sir said riddle muggle father witch motherand are both your parents my mother died just after i was born sir they told me at theorphanage she lived just long enough to name me tom after myfather marvolo after my grandfatherdipper clucked his tongue sympatheticallythe thing is tom he sighed special arrangements might havebeen made for you but in the current circumstances you mean all these attacks sir said riddle and harrys heartleapt and he moved closer scared of missing anythingprecisely said the headmaster my dear boy you must see howfoolish it would be of me to allow you to remain at the castle whenterm ends particularly in light of the recent tragedy the death ofthat poor little girl you will be safer by far at your orphanage asa matter of fact the ministry of magic is even now talking aboutclosing the school we are no nearer locating the er source of allthis unpleasantness riddles eyes had widenedsir if the person was caught if it all stopped what do you mean said dippet with a squeak in his voice sittingup in his chair riddle do you mean you know something aboutthese attacksno sir said riddle quicklybut harry was sure it was the same sort of no that he himself hadgiven dumbledoredippet sank back looking faintly disappointedyou may go tom riddle slid off his chair and slouched out of the room harryfollowed himdown the moving spiral staircase they went emerging next to thegargoyle in the darkening corridor riddle stopped and so didharry watching him harry could tell that riddle was doing someserious thinking he was biting his lip his forehead furrowedthen as though he had suddenly reached a decision he hurried offharry gliding noiselessly behind him they didnt see another personuntil they reached the entrance hall when a tall wizard with longsweeping auburn hair and a beard called to riddle from the marblestaircasewhat are you doing wandering around this late tomharry gaped at the wizard he was none other than a fiftyyearyoungerdumbledorei had to see the headmaster sir said riddlewell hurry off to bed said dumbledore giving riddle exactly thekind of penetrating stare harry knew so well best not to roam thecorridors these days not since he sighed heavily bade riddle good night and strode off riddlewatched him walk out of sight and then moving quickly headedstraight down the stone steps to the dungeons with harry in hotpursuitbut to harrys disappointment riddle led him not into a hiddenpassageway or a secret tunnel but to the very dungeon in whichharry had potions with snape the torches hadnt been lit and whenriddle pushed the door almost closed harry could only justsee him standing stockstill by the door watching the passage outsideit felt to harry that they were there for at least an hour all he couldsee was the figure of riddle at the door staring through the crackwaiting like a statue and just when harry had stopped feelingexpectant and tense and started wishing he could return to the presenthe heard something move beyond the doorsomeone was creeping along the passage he heard whoever it waspass the dungeon where he and riddle were hidden riddle quiet as ashadow edged through the door and followed harry tiptoeing behindhim forgetting that he couldnt be heardfor perhaps five minutes they followed the footsteps until riddlestopped suddenly his head inclined in the direction of new noisesharry heard a door creak open and then someone speaking in ahoarse whispercmon gotta get yeh outta here cmon now in the box there was something familiar about that voice riddle suddenly jumped around the corner harry stepped out behindhim he could see the dark outline of a huge boy who was crouchingin front of an open door a very large box next to itevening rubeus said riddle sharplythe boy slammed the door shut and stood upwhat yer doin down here tomriddle stepped closerits all over he said im going to have to turn you in rubeustheyre talking about closing hogwarts if the attacks dont stopn at dyeh i dont think you meant to kill anyone but monsters dont makegood pets i suppose you just let it out for exercise and it never killed no one said the large boy backing against theclosed door from behind him harry could hear a funny rustling andclickingcome on rubeus said riddle moving yet closer the dead girlsparents will be here tomorrow the least hogwarts can do is makesure that the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered it wasnt him roared the boy his voice echoing in the darkpassage he wouldn he neverstand aside said riddle drawing out his wandhis spell lit the corridor with a sudden flaming light the door behindthe large boy flew open with such force it knocked him into the wallopposite and out of it came something that made harry let out along piercing scream unheard by anyonea vast lowslung hairy body and a tangle of black legs a gleam ofmany eyes and a pair of razorsharp pincers riddle raised hiswand again but he was too late the thing bowled him over as itscuttled away tearing up the corridor and out of sight riddlescrambled to his feet looking after it he raised his wand but thehuge boy leapt on him seized his wand and threw him back downyelling nothe scene whirled the darkness became complete harry felt himselffalling and with a crash he landed spreadeagled on his fourposterin the gryffindor dormitory riddles diary lying open on his stomachbefore he had had time to regain his breath the dormitory dooropened and ron came inthere you are he saidharry sat up he was sweating and shakingwhats up said ron looking at him with concernit was hagrid ron hagrid opened the chamber of secrets fiftyyears agoharry ron and hermione had always known that hagrid had anunfortunate liking for large and monstrous creatures during their firstyear at hogwarts he had tried to raise a dragon in his little woodenhouse and it would be a long time before they forgot the giant threeheadeddog hed christened fluffy and if as a boy hagrid hadheard that a monster was hidden somewhere in the castle harry wassure hed have gone to any lengths for a glimpse of it hed probablythought it was a shame that the monster had been cooped up solong and thought it deserved the chance to stretch its many legsharry could just imagine the thirteenyearold hagrid trying to fit aleash and collar on it but he was equally certain that hagrid wouldnever have meant to kill anybodyharry half wished he hadnt found out how to work riddles diaryagain and again ron and hermione made him recount whathed seen until he was heartily sick of telling them and sick of thelong circular conversations that followedriddle might have got the wrong person said hermione maybe itwas some other monster that was attacking people how many monsters dyou think this place can hold ron askeddullywe always knew hagrid had been expelled said harry miserablyand the attacks mustve stopped after hagrid was kicked outotherwise riddle wouldnt have got his awardron tried a different tackriddle does sound like percy who asked him to squeal on hagridanywaybut the monster had killed someone ron said hermioneand riddle was going to go back to some muggle orphanage if theyclosed hogwarts said harry i dont blame him for wanting to stayhere you met hagrid down knockturn alley didnt you harryhe was buying a flesheating slug repellent said harry quicklythe three of them fell silent after a long pause hermione voiced theknottiest question of all in a hesitant voicedo you think we should go and ask hagrid about it allthatd be a cheerful visit said ron hello hagrid tell us haveyou been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle latelyin the end they decided that they would not say anything to hagridunless there was another attack and as more and more days went bywith no whisper from the disembodied voice they becamehopeful that they would never need to talk to him about why he hadbeen expelled it was now nearly four months since justin and nearlyheadless nick had been petrified and nearly everybody seemed tothink that the attacker whoever it was had retired for good peeveshad finally got bored of his oh potter you rotter song erniemacmillan asked harry quite politely to pass a bucket of leapingtoadstools in herbology one day and in march several of themandrakes threw a loud and raucous party in greenhouse three thismade professor sprout very happythe moment they start trying to move into each others pots wellknow theyre fully mature she told harry then well be able torevive those poor people in the hospital wingthe second years were given something new to think about duringtheir easter holidays the time had come to choose their subjects forthe third year a matter that hermione at least took very seriouslyit could affect our whole future she told harry and ron as theypored over lists of new subjects marking them with checksi just want to give up potions said harrywe cant said ron gloomily we keep all our old subjects or idveditched defense against the dark artsbut thats very important said hermione shockednot the way lockhart teaches it said ron i havent learnedanything from him except not to set pixies looseneville longbottom had been sent letters from all the witches andwizards in his family all giving him different advice on what tochoose confused and worried he sat reading the subject lists withhis tongue poking out asking people whether they thought arithmancysounded more difficult than the study of ancient runes deanthomas who like harry had grown up with muggles ended upclosing his eyes and jabbing his wand at the list then picking thesubjects it landed on hermione took nobodys advice but signed up foreverythingharry smiled grimly to himself at the thought of what uncle vernonand aunt petunia would say if he tried to discuss his career inwizardry with them not that he didnt get any guidance percyweasley was eager to share his experiencedepends where you want to go harry he said its never too earlyto think about the future so id recommend divination people saymuggle studies is a soft option but i personally think wizards shouldhave a thorough understanding of the nonmagical communityparticularly if theyre thinking of working in close contact with them look at my father he has to deal with muggle business all the time mybrother charlie was always more of an outdoor type so he went forcare of magical creatures play to your strengths harrybut the only thing harry felt he was really good at was quidditch inthe end he chose the same new subjects as ron feeling that if he waslousy at them at least hed have someone friendly to help himgryffindors next quidditch match would be against hufflepuff woodwas insisting on team practices every night after dinner so that harrybarely had time for anything but quidditch and homework howeverthe training sessions were getting better or at leastdrier and the evening before saturdays match he went up to hisdormitory to drop off his broomstick feeling gryffindors chances forthe quidditch cup had never been betterbut his cheerful mood didnt last long at the top of the stairs to thedormitory he met neville longbottom who was looking franticharry i dont know who did it i just found watching harry fearfully neville pushed open the doorthe contents of harrys trunk had been thrown everywhere hiscloak lay ripped on the floor the bedclothes had been pulled off hisfourposter and the drawer had been pulled out of his bedsidecabinet the contents strewn over the mattressharry walked over to the bed openmouthed treading on a fewloose pages of travels with trolls

into itthat he realized what wasnt thereriddles diarys gone he said in an undertone to ronwhatharry jerked his head toward the dormitory door and ron followedhim out they hurried down to the gryffindor commonroom which was halfempty and joined hermione who was sittingalone reading a book called ancient runes made easyhermione looked aghast at the newsbut only a gryffindor could have stolen nobody else knows ourpassword exactly said harrythey woke the next day to brilliant sunshine and a light refreshingbreezeperfect quidditch conditions said wood enthusiastically at thegryffindor table loading the teams plates with scrambled eggsharry buck up there you need a decent breakfastharry had been staring down the packed gryffindor table wonderingif the new owner of riddles diary was right in front of his eyeshermione had been urging him to report the robbery but harry didntlike the idea hed have to tell a teacher all about the diary and howmany people knew why hagrid had been expelled fifty years ago hedidnt want to be the one who brought it all up againas he left the great hall with ron and hermione to go and collect hisquidditch things another very serious worry was added to harrysgrowing list he had just set foot on the marble staircase when heheard it yet againkill this time let me rip tear he shouted aloud and ron and hermione both jumped away from himin alarmthe voice said harry looking over his shoulder i just heard itagain didnt youron shook his head wideeyed hermione however clapped ahand to her foreheadharry i think ive just understood something ive got to go to thelibraryand she sprinted away up the stairswhat does she understand said harry distractedly still lookingaround trying to tell where the voice had come fromloads more than i do said ron shaking his headbut whys she got to go to the librarybecause thats what hermione does said ron shrugging when indoubt go to the libraryharry stood irresolute trying to catch the voice again but peoplewere now emerging from the great hall behind him talking loudlyexiting through the front doors on their way to the quidditch pitchyoud better get moving said ron its nearly eleven the match harry raced up to gryffindor tower collected his nimbus twothousand and joined the large crowd swarming across the groundsbut his mind was still in the castle along with the bodiless voice andas he pulled on his scarlet robes in the locker room his only comfortwas that everyone was now outside to watch the gamethe teams walked onto the field to tumultuous applause oliverwood took off for a warmup flight around the goal posts madamhooch released the balls the hufflepuffs who played in canaryyellow were standing in a huddle having a lastminute discussion oftacticsharry was just mounting his broom when professor mcgonagallcame half marching half running across the pitch carrying anenormous purple megaphoneharrys heart dropped like a stonethis match has been cancelled professor mcgonagall calledthrough the megaphone addressing the packed stadium there wereboos and shouts oliver wood looking devastated landed and rantoward professor mcgonagall without getting off his broomstickbut professor he shouted weve got to play the cupgryffindor professor mcgonagall ignored him and continued to shout through hermegaphoneall students are to make their way back to the house commonrooms where their heads of houses will give them furtherinformation as quickly as you can pleasethen she lowered the megaphone and beckoned harry over to herpotter i think youd better come with me wondering how she could possibly suspect him this time harry sawron detach himself from the complaining crowd he came running upto them as they set off toward the castle to harrys surpriseprofessor mcgonagall didnt objectyes perhaps youd better come too weasley some of the students swarming around them were grumbling aboutthe match being canceled others looked worried harry and ronfollowed professor mcgonagall back into the school and up themarble staircase but they werent taken to anybodys office this timethis will be a bit of a shock said professor mcgonagall in asurprisingly gentle voice as they approached the infirmary there hasbeen another attack another double attackharrys insides did a horrible somersault professor mcgonagallpushed the door open and he and ron entered madam pomfrey was bending over a fifthyear girl with long curlyhair harry recognized her as the ravenclaw theyd accidentallyasked for directions to the slytherin common room and on the bednext to her washermione ron groanedhermione lay utterly still her eyes open and glassythey were found near the library said professor mcgonagall idont suppose either of you can explain this it was on the floor nextto them she was holding up a small circular mirrorharry and ron shook their heads both staring at hermionei will escort you back to gryffindor tower said professormcgonagall heavily i need to address the students in any caseall students will return to their house common rooms by six oclockin the evening no student is to leave the dormitories after that timeyou will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher no student is to usethe bathroom unaccompanied by a teacher all further quidditchtraining and matches are to be postponed there will be no moreevening activitiesthe gryffindors packed inside the common room listened to professormcgonagall in silence she rolled up the parchmentfrom which she had been reading and said in a somewhat chokedvoice i need hardly add that i have rarely been so distressed it islikely that the school will be closed unless the culprit behind theseattacks is caught i would urge anyone who thinks they might knowanything about them to come forwardshe climbed somewhat awkwardly out of the portrait hole and thegryffindors began talking immediatelythats two gryffindors down not counting a gryffindor ghost oneravenclaw and one hufflepuff said the weasley twins friend leejordan counting on his fingers havent any of the teachers noticedthat the slytherins are all safe isnt it obvious all this stuffs comingfrom slytherin the heir of slytherin the monster of slytherin whydont they just chuck all the slytherins out he roared to nods andscattered applausepercy weasley was sitting in a chair behind lee but for once he didntseem keen to make his views heard he was looking pale and stunnedpercys in shock george told harry quietly that ravenclaw girl penelope clearwater shes a prefect i dont think he thought themonster would dare attack a prefectbut harry was only halflistening he didnt seem to be able to get ridof the picture of hermione lying on the hospital bed as though carvedout of stone and if the culprit wasnt caught soon he was looking at alifetime back with the dursleys tom riddle had turned hagrid inbecause he was faced with the prospect of a muggle orphanage if theschool closed harry now knew exactly how he had feltwhatre we going to do said ron quietly in harrys ear dyouthink they suspect hagridweve got to go and talk to him said harry making up hismind i cant believe its him this time but if he set the monsterloose last time hell know how to get inside the chamber of secretsand thats a startbut mcgonagall said weve got to stay in our tower unless werein class i think said harry more quietly still its time to get my dadsold cloak out againharry had inherited ust one thing from his father a long and silvery invisibility cloak it was their only chance of sneaking out ofthe school to visit hagrid without anyone knowing about it theywent to bed at the usual time waited until neville dean and seamus had stopped discussing the chamber of secrets and finallyfallen asleep then got up dressed again and threw the cloak overthemselvesthe journey through the dark and deserted castle corridorswasnt enjoyable harry who had wandered the castle at night several times before had never seen it so crowded after sunset teachers prefects and ghosts were marching the corridors in pairsstaring around for any unusual activity their invisibility cloakdidnt stop them making any noise and there was a particularlytense moment when ron stubbed his toe only yards from the spotwhere snape stood standing guard thankfully snape sneezed atalmost exactly the moment ron swore it was with relief that theyreached the oak front doors and eased them openit was a clear starry night they hurried toward the lit windowsof hagrids house and pulled off the cloak only when they wereright outside his front doorseconds after they had knocked hagrid flung it open they foundthemselves facetoface with him aiming a crossbow at them fangthe boarhound barked loudly behind himoh he said lowering the weapon and staring at them whatreyou two doin herewhats that for said harry pointing at the crossbow as theystepped insidenothin nothin hagrid muttered ive bin expectin doesnmatter sit down ill make tea he hardly seemed to know what he was doing he nearlyextinguished the fire spilling water from the kettle on it and thensmashed the teapot with a nervous jerk of his massive handare you okay hagrid said harry did you hear abouthermioneoh i heard all righ said hagrid a slight break in his voicehe kept glancing nervously at the windows he poured them bothlarge mugs of boiling water he had forgotten to add tea bags andwas just putting a slab of fruitcake on a plate when there was a loudknock on the doorhagrid dropped the fruitcake harry and ron exchangedpanicstricken looks then threw the invisibility cloak back overthemselves and retreated into a corner hagrid checked that theywere hidden seized his crossbow and flung open his door oncemoregood evening hagridit was dumbledore he entered looking deadly serious and wasfollowed by a second very oddlooking manthe stranger had rumpled gray hair and an anxious expression andwas wearing a strange mixture of clothes a pinstriped suit

audible gaspmr lucius malfoy strode into hagrids hut swathed in a long blacktraveling cloak smiling a cold and satisfied smile fang started togrowlalready here fudge he said approvingly good good whatre you doin here said hagrid furiously get outta my housemy dear man please believe me i have no pleasure at all in beinginside your er dyou call this a house said lucius malfoy sneeringas he looked around the small cabin i simply called at the school andwas told that the headmaster was hereand what exactly did you want with me lucius said dumbledorehe spoke politely but the fire was still blazing in his blue eyesdreadful thing dumbledore said malfoy lazily taking out a long rollof parchment but the governors feel its time for you to step asidethis is an order of suspension youll find

many did yeh have ter threaten an blackmail before theyagreed malfoy eh he roareddear dear you know that temper of yours will lead you into troubleone of these days hagrid said mr malfoy i would

stuttered fudgenogrowled hagriddumbledore had not taken his bright blue eyes off lucius malfoyscold gray oneshowever said dumbledore speaking very slowly and clearly so thatnone of them could miss a word you will find that i willummer was creeping over the grounds around the castle sky and lakealike turned periwinkle blue and flowers large as cabbages burst intobloom in the greenhouses but with no hagrid visible from the castlewindows striding the grounds with fang at his heels the scene didntlook right to harry no better in fact than the inside of the castlewhere things were so horribly wrongharry and ron had tried to visit hermione but visitors were nowbarred from the hospital wingwere taking no more chances madam pomfrey told them severelythrough a crack in the infirmary door no im sorry theres everychance the attacker might come back to finish these people off with dumbledore gone fear had spread as never before so that thesun warming the castle walls outside seemed to stop at the mullionedwindows there was barely a face to be seen in the schoolthat didnt look worried and tense and any laughter that rang throughthe corridors sounded shrill and unnatural and was quickly stifledharry constantly repeated dumbledores final words to himself i willonly truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me help willalways be given at hogwarts to those who ask for it but what goodwere these words who exactly were they supposed to ask for helpwhen everyone was just as confused and scared as they werehagrids hint about the spiders was far easier to understand thetrouble was there didnt seem to be a single spider left in the castle tofollow harry looked everywhere he went helped rather reluctantlyby ron they were hampered of course by the fact that they werentallowed to wander off on their own but had to move around the castlein a pack with the other gryffindors most of their fellow studentsseemed glad that they were being shepherded from class to class byteachers but harry found it very irksomeone person however seemed to be thoroughly enjoying theatmosphere of terror and suspicion draco malfoy was struttingaround the school as though he had just been appointed head boyharry didnt realize what he was so pleased about until the potionslesson about two weeks after dumbledore and hagrid had left whensitting right behind malfoy harry overheard him gloating to crabbeand goylei always thought father might be the one who got rid ofdumbledore he said not troubling to keep his voice down i told youhe thinks dumbledores the worst headmaster the schools everhad maybe well get a decent headmaster now someone who wontwant the chamber of secrets closed mcgonagall wont last longshes only filling in snape swept past harry making no comment about hermionesempty seat and cauldronsir said malfoy loudly sir why dont you apply for theheadmasters jobnow now malfoy said snape though he couldnt suppress a thinlippedsmile professor dumbledore has only been suspended by thegovernors i daresay hell be back with us soon enoughyeah right said malfoy smirking i expect youd have fathersvote sir if you wanted to apply for the job ill tell father youre thebest teacher here sir snape smirked as he swept off around the dungeon fortunately notspotting seamus finnigan who was pretending to vomit into hiscauldronim quite surprised the mudbloods havent all packed their bags bynow malfoy went on bet you five galleons the next one dies pityit wasnt granger the bell rang at that moment which was lucky at malfoys lastwords ron had leapt off his stool and in the scramble to collect bagsand books his attempts to reach malfoy went unnoticedlet me at him ron growled as harry and dean hung onto his armsi dont care i dont need my wand im going to kill him with my barehands hurry up ive got to take you all to herbology barked snape overthe classs heads and off they marched with harry ron and deanbringing up the rear ron still trying to get loose it was onlysafe to let go of him when snape had seen them out of the castle andthey were making their way across the vegetable patch toward thegreenhousesthe herbology class was very subdued there were now two missingfrom their number justin and hermioneprofessor sprout set them all to work pruning the abyssinianshrivelfigs harry went to tip an armful of withered stalks onto thecompost heap and found himself facetoface with ernie macmillanernie took a deep breath and said very formally i just want to sayharry that im sorry i ever suspected you i know youd never attackhermione granger and i apologize for all the stuff i said were all inthe same boat now and well he held out a pudgy hand and harry shook iternie and his friend hannah came to work at the same shrivelfig asharry and ronthat draco malfoy character said ernie breaking off dead twigshe seems very pleased about all this doesnt he dyou know i thinkhe might be slytherins heirthats clever of you said ron who didnt seem to have forgivenernie as readily as harrydo you think its malfoy harry ernie askedno said harry so firmly that ernie and hannah stareda second later harry spotted somethingseveral large spiders were scuttling over the ground on the other sideof the glass moving in an unnaturally straight line as though taking theshortest route to a prearranged meeting harry hit ron over the handwith his pruning shearsouch whatre you harry pointed out the spiders following their progress with his eyesscrewed up against the sunoh yeah said ron trying and failing to look pleased but we cantfollow them now ernie and hannah were listening curiouslyharrys eyes narrowed as he focused on the spiders if they pursuedtheir fixed course there could be no doubt about where they wouldend uplooks like theyre heading for the forbidden forest and ron looked even unhappier about thatat the end of the lesson professor sprout escorted the class to theirdefense against the dark arts lesson harry and ron lagged behindthe others so they could talk out of earshotwell have to use the invisibility cloak again harry told ron wecan take fang with us hes used to going into the forest with hagridhe might be some helpright said ron who was twirling his wand nervously in his fingerser arent there arent there supposed to be werewolves in theforest he added as they took their usual places at the back oflockharts classroompreferring not to answer that question harry said there are goodthings in there too the centaurs are all right and the unicorns ron had never been into the forbidden forest before harry hadentered it only once and had hoped never to do so againlockhart bounded into the room and the class stared at him everyother teacher in the place was looking grimmer than usual butlockhart appeared nothing short of buoyantcome now he cried beaming around him why all these longfacespeople swapped exasperated looks but nobody answereddont you people realize said lockhart speaking slowly as thoughthey were all a bit dim the danger has passed the culprit has beentaken away says who said dean thomas loudlymy dear young man the minister of magic wouldnt have takenhagrid if he hadnt been one hundred percent sure that he was guiltysaid lockhart in the tone of someone explaining that one and onemade twooh yes he would said ron even more loudly than deani flatter myself i know a touch more about hagrids arrest than youdo mr weasley said lockhart in a selfsatisfied toneron started to say that he didnt think so somehow but stopped inmidsentence when harry kicked him hard under the deskwe werent there remember harry mutteredbut lockharts disgusting cheeriness his hints that he had alwaysthought hagrid was no good his confidence that the whole businesswas now at an end irritated harry so much that he yearned to throwgadding with ghouls right in lockharts stupid face instead hecontented himself with scrawling a note to ron lets do it tonightron read the message swallowed hard and looked sideways at theempty seat usually filled by hermione the sight seemed to stiffen hisresolve and he noddedthe gryffindor common room was always very crowded these daysbecause from six oclock onward the gryffindors had no where else to go they also had plenty to talk about with the resultthat the common room often didnt empty until past midnightharry went to get the invisibility cloak out of his trunk right afterdinner and spent the evening sitting on it waiting for the room toclear fred and george challenged harry and ron to a few games ofexploding snap and ginny sat watching them very subdued inhermiones usual chair harry and ron kept losing on purpose tryingto finish the games quickly but even so it was well past midnightwhen fred george and ginny finally went to bedharry and ron waited for the distant sounds of two dormitory doorsclosing before seizing the cloak throwing it over themselves andclimbing through the portrait holeit was another difficult journey through the castle dodging all theteachers at last they reached the entrance hall slid back the lock onthe oak front doors squeezed between them trying to stop anycreaking and stepped out into the moonlit groundscourse said ron abruptly as they strode across the black grasswe might get to the forest and find theres nothing to follow thosespiders might notve been going there at all i know it looked like theywere moving in that sort of general direction but his voice trailed away hopefullythey reached hagrids house sad and sorrylooking with its blankwindows when harry pushed the door open fang went mad with joyat the sight of them worried he might wake everyone at the castlewith his deep booming barks they hastily fed him treacle fudge froma tin on the mantelpiece which glued his teeth togetherharry left the invisibility cloak on hagrids table there would be noneed for it in the pitchdark forestl cmon fang were going for a walk said harry patting his leg andfang bounded happily out of the house behind them dashed to theedge of the forest and lifted his leg against a large sycamore treeharry took out his wand murmured lumos and a tiny lightappeared at the end of it just enough to let them watch the path forsigns of spidersgood thinking said ron id light mine too but you know itdprobably blow up or something harry tapped ron on the shoulder pointing at the grass two solitaryspiders were hurrying away from the wandlight into the shade of thetreesokay ron sighed as though resigned to the worst im ready letsgoso with fang scampering around them sniffing tree roots and leavesthey entered the forest by the glow of harrys wand they followedthe steady trickle of spiders moving along the path they walkedbehind them for about twenty minutes not speaking listening hard fornoises other than breaking twigs and rustling leaves then when thetrees had become thicker than ever so that the stars overhead wereno longer visible and harrys wand shone alone in the sea of darkthey saw their spider guides leaving the pathharry paused trying to see where the spiders were going buteverything outside his little sphere of light was pitchblack he hadnever been this deep into the forest before he could vividlyremember hagrid advising him not to leave the forest path last timehed been in here but hagrid was miles away now probably sitting ina cell in azkaban and he had also said to follow the spidersv something wet touched harrys hand and he jumped backwardcrushing rods foot but it was only fangs nosewhat dyou reckon harry said to ron whose eyes he could justmake out reflecting the light from his wandweve come this far said ronso they followed the darting shadows of the spiders into the treesthey couldnt move very quickly now there were tree roots andstumps in their way barely visible in the near blackness harry couldfeel fangs hot breath on his hand more than once they had to stopso that harry could crouch down and find the spiders in the wandlightthey walked for what seemed like at least half an hour their robessnagging on lowslung branches and brambles after a while theynoticed that the ground seemed to be sloping downward though thetrees were as thick as everthen fang suddenly let loose a great echoing bark making both harryand ron jump out of their skinswhat said ron loudly looking around into the pitchdark andgripping harrys elbow very hardtheres something moving over there harry breathed listen sounds like something big they listened some distance to their right the something big wassnapping branches as it carved a path through the treesoh no said ron oh no oh no oh shut up said harry frantically itll hear youhear me said ron in an unnaturally high voice its already heardfangthe darkness seemed to be pressing on their eyeballs as theystood terrified waiting there was a strange rumbling noise and thensilencewhat dyou think its doing said harryprobably getting ready to pounce said ronthey waited shivering hardly daring to movedyou think its gone harry whispereddunno then to their right came a sudden blaze of light so bright in thedarkness that both of them flung up their hands to shield their eyesfang yelped and tried to run but got lodged in a tangle of thorns andyelped even louderharry ron shouted his voice breaking with relief harry its ourcarwhatcome onharry blundered after ron toward the light stumbling and trippingand a moment later they had emerged into a clearingmr weasleys car was standing empty in the middle of a circle ofthick trees under a roof of dense branches its headlights ablaze asron walked openmouthed toward it it moved slowly toward himexactly like a large turquoise dog greeting its ownerits been here all the time said ron delightedly walking around thecar look at it the forests turned it wild the sides of the car were scratched and smeared with mudapparently it had taken to trundling around the forest on its ownfang didnt seem at all keen on it he kept close to harry who couldfeel him quivering his breathing slowing down again harry stuffedhis wand back into his robesand we thought it was going to attack us said ron leaning againstthe car and patting it i wondered where it had goneharry squinted around on the floodlit ground for signs of more spidersbut they had all scuttled away from the glare of the headlightsweve lost the trail he said cmon lets go and find themron didnt speak he didnt move his eyes were fixed on a pointsome ten feet above the forest floor right behind harry his face waslivid with terrorharry didnt even have time to turn around there was a loud clickingnoise and suddenly he felt something long and hairy seize him aroundthe middle and lift him off the ground so that he was hangingfacedown struggling terrified he heard more clicking and saw ronslegs leave the ground too heard fang whimpering and howling nextmoment he was being swept away into the dark treeshead hanging harry saw that what had hold of him was marching onsix immensely long hairy legs the front two clutching him tightly belowa pair of shining black pincers behind him he could hear another ofthe creatures no doubt carrying ron they were moving into the veryheart of the forest harry could hear fang fighting to free himself froma third monster whining loudly but harry couldnt have yelled even ifhe had wanted to he seemed to have left his voice back with the carin the clearinghe never knew how long he was in the creatures clutches he onlyknew that the darkness suddenly lifted enough for him to see that theleafstrewn ground was now swarming with spiders craning his necksideways he realized that they had reached the ridge ofa vast hollow a hollow that had been cleared of trees so that the starsshone brightly onto the worst scene he had ever laid eyes onspiders not tiny spiders like those surging over the leaves belowspiders the size of carthorses eighteyed eightlegged black hairygigantic the massive specimen that was carrying harry made its waydown the steep slope toward a misty domed web in the very center ofthe hollow while its fellows closed in all around it clicking theirpincers excitedly at the sight of its loadharry fell to the ground on all fours as the spider released him ronand fang thudded down next to him fang wasnt howling anymorebut cowering silently on the spot ron looked exactly like harry felthis mouth was stretched wide in a kind of silent scream and his eyeswere poppingharry suddenly realized that the spider that had dropped him wassaying something it had been hard to tell because he clicked hispincers with every word he spokearagog it called aragogand from the middle of the misty domed web a spider the size of asmall elephant emerged very slowly there was gray in the black ofhis body and legs and each of the eyes on his ugly pincered head wasmilky white he was blindwhat is it he said clicking his pincers rapidlymen clicked the spider who had caught harryis it hagrid said aragog moving closer his eight milky eyeswandering vaguelystrangers clicked the spider who had brought ronkill them clicked aragog fretfully i was sleeping were friends of hagrids harry shouted his heart seemed to haveleft his chest to pound in his throatclick click click went the pincers of the spiders all around the hollowaragog pausedhagrid has never sent men into our hollow before he said slowlyhagrids in trouble said harry breathing very fast thats whyweve comein trouble said the aged spider and harry thought he heard concernbeneath the clicking pincers but why has he sent youharry thought of getting to his feet but decided against it he didntthink his legs would support him so he spoke from the ground ascalmly as he couldthey think up at the school that hagrids been setting a a something on students theyve taken him to azkabanaragog clicked his pincers furiously and all around the hollow thesound was echoed by the crowd of spiders it was like applauseexcept applause didnt usually make harry feel sick with fearbut that was years ago said aragog fretfully years and years agoi remember it well thats why they made him leave the school theybelieved that i was the monster that dwells in what they call thechamber of secrets they thought that hagrid had opened thechamber and set me freeand you you didnt come from the chamber of secrets saidharry who could feel cold sweat on his foreheadi said aragog clicking angrily i was not born in the castle i comefrom a distant land a traveler gave me to hagrid when i was an egghagrid was only a boy but he cared for me hidden in a cupboard inthe castle feeding me on scraps from the table hagridyis my good friend and a good man when i was discovered andblamed for the death of a girl he protected me i have lived here inthe forest ever since where hagrid still visits me he even found mea wife mosag and you see how our family has grown all throughhagrids goodness harry summoned what remained of his courageso you never never attacked anyonenever croaked the old spider it would have been my instinct butout of respect for hagrid i never harmed a human the body of thegirl who was killed was discovered in a bathroom i never saw anypart of the castle but the cupboard in which i grew up our kind likethe dark and the quiet but then do you know what did kill that girl said harrybecause whatever it is its back and attacking people again his words were drowned by a loud outbreak of clicking and therustling of many long legs shifting angrily large black shapes shiftedall around himthe thing that lives in the castle said aragog is an ancient creaturewe spiders fear above all others well do i remember how i pleadedwith hagrid to let me go when i sensed the beast moving about theschoolwhat is it said harry urgentlymore loud clicking more rustling the spiders seemed to be closing inwe do not speak of it said aragog fiercely we do not name it inever even told hagrid the name of that dread creature though heasked me many timesharry didnt want to press the subject not with the spidersv pressing closer on all sides aragog seemed to be tired of tamng hewas backing slowly into his domed web but his fellow spiderscontinued to inch slowly toward harry and ronwell just go then harry called desperately to aragog hearingleaves rustling behind himgo said aragog slowly i think not but but my sons and daughters do not harm hagrid on my command but icannot deny them fresh meat when it wanders so willingly into ourmidst goodbye friend of hagridharry spun around feet away towering above him was a solid wallof spiders clicking their many eyes gleaming in their ugly black headseven as he reached for his wand harry knew it was no good therewere too many of them but as he tried to stand ready to die fightinga loud long note sounded and a blaze of light flamed through thehollowmr weasleys car was thundering down the slope headlights glaringits horn screeching knocking spiders aside several were thrown ontotheir backs their endless legs waving in the air the car screeched toa halt in front of harry and ron and the doors flew openget fang harry yelled diving into the front seat ron seized theboarhound around the middle and threw him yelping into the back ofthe car the doors slammed shut ron didnt touch the acceleratorbut the car didnt need him the engine roared and they were offhitting more spiders they sped up the slope out of the hollow andthey were soon crashing through the forest brancheswhipping the windows as the car wound its way cleverly through thewidest gaps following a path it obviously knewharry looked sideways at ron his mouth was still open in the silentscream but his eyes werent popping anymoreare you okayron stared straight ahead unable to speakthey smashed their way through the undergrowth fang howling loudlyin the back seat and harry saw the side mirror snap off as theysqueezed past a large oak after ten noisy rocky minutes the treesthinned and harry could again see patches of skythe car stopped so suddenly that they were nearly thrown into thewindshield they had reached the edge of the forest fang flunghimself at the window in his anxiety to get out and when harryopened the door he shot off through the trees to hagrids house tailbetween his legs harry got out too and after a minute or so ronseemed to regain the feeling in his limbs and followed still stiffneckedand staring harry gave the car a grateful pat as it reversed back intothe forest and disappeared from viewharry went back into hagrids cabin to get the invisibility cloak fangwas trembling under a blanket in his basket when harry got outsideagain he found ron being violently sick in the pumpkin patchfollow the spiders said ron weakly wiping his mouth on his sleeveill never forgive hagrid were lucky to be alivei bet he thought aragog wouldnt hurt friends of his said harrythats exactly hagrids problem said ron thumping the wall of thecabin he always thinks monsters arent as bad as theyremade out and look where its got him a cell in azkaban he wasshivering uncontrollably now what was the point of sending us inthere what have we found out id like to knowthat hagrid never opened the chamber of secrets said harrythrowing the cloak over ron and prodding him in the arm to make himwalk he was innocentron gave a loud snort evidently hatching aragog in a cupboardwasnt his idea of being innocentas the castle loomed nearer harry twitched the cloak to make suretheir feet were hidden then pushed the creaking front doors ajarthey walked carefully back across the entrance hall and up themarble staircase holding their breath as they passed corridors wherewatchful sentries were walking at last they reached the safety of thegryffindor common room where the fire had burned itself intoglowing ash they took off the cloak and climbed the winding stair totheir dormitoryron fell onto his bed without bothering to get undressed harryhowever didnt feel very sleepy he sat on the edge of his fourposterthinking hard about everything aragog had saidthe creature that was lurking somewhere in the castle he thoughtsounded like a sort of monster voldemort even other monsters didntwant to name it but he and ron were no closer to finding out what itwas or how it petrified its victims even hagrid had never knownwhat was in the chamber of secretsharry swung his legs up onto his bed and leaned back against hispillows watching the moon glinting at him through the tower windowhe couldnt see what else they could do they had hit dead endseverywhere riddle had caught the wrong person the heir ofslytherin had got off and no one could tell whether it was the sameperson or a different one who had opened the chamber this timethere was nobody else to ask harry lay down still thinking aboutwhat aragog had saidhe was becoming drowsy when what seemed like their very lasthope occurred to him and he suddenly sat bolt uprightron he hissed through the dark ron ron woke with a yelp like fangs stared wildly around and sawharryron that girl who died aragog said she was found in a bathroomsaid harry ignoring nevilles snufing snores from the corner whatif she never left the bathroom what if shes still thereron rubbed his eyes frowning through the moonlight and then heunderstood tooyou dont think not moaning myrtlea ll those times we were in that bathroom and she was justthree toilets away said ron bitterly at breakfast next dayand we couldve asked her and now it had been hard enough trying to look for spiders escaping theirteachers long enough to sneak into a girls bathroom the girls bathroommoreover right next to the scene of the first attack was going to bealmost impossiblebut something happened in their first lesson transfiguration that drovethe chamber of secrets out of their minds for the first time in weeksten minutes into the class professor mcgonagall told them that theirexams would start on the first of june one week from todayexams howled seamus finnigan were

mcgonagall scowleven more darklyprofessor dumbledores instructions were to keep the school runningas normally as possible she said and that i need hardly point outmeans finding out how much you have

at theslytherin table and wasnt at all surprised to see that draco malfoyhadnt joined in ron however was looking happier than hed looked indaysit wont matter that we never asked myrtle then he said to harryhermionell probably have all the answers when they wake her upmind you shell go crazy when she finds out weve got exams in threedays time she hasnt studied it might be kinder to leave her whereshe is till theyre overjust then ginny weasley came over and sat down next to ron shelooked tense and nervous and harry noticed that her hands weretwisting in her lapwhats up said ron helping himself to more porridgeginny didnt say anything but glanced up and down the gryffindortable with a scared look on her face that reminded harry of someonethough he couldnt think whospit it out said ron watching herharry suddenly realized who ginny looked like she was rockingbackward and forward slightly in her chair exactly like dobby didwhen he was teetering on the edge of revealing forbidden

deep breath and at that precise moment percy weasleyappeared looking tired and wanif youve finished eating ill take that seat ginny im starving iveonly just come off patrol dutyginny jumped up as though her chair had just been electrified gavepercy a fleeting frightened look and scampered away percy satdown and grabbed a mug from the center of the tablepercy said ron angrily she was just about

withouttheir help but he wasnt about to pass up a chance to speak to myrtleif it turned up and to his delight it did midmorning when they werebeing led to history of magic by gilderoy lockhartlockhart who had so often assured them that all danger had passedonly to be proved wrong right away was now wholeheartedlyconvinced that it was hardly worth the trouble to see them safelydown the corridors his hair wasnt as sleek as usual it seemed hehad been up most of the night patrolling the fourth floormark my words he said ushering them around a corner the firstwords out of those poor petrified peoples mouths will be it washagrid frankly im astounded professor mcgonagall thinks allthese security measures are necessaryti agree sir said harry making ron drop his books in surprisethank you harry said lockhart graciously while they waited for along line of hufflepuffs to pass i mean we teachers have quiteenough to be getting on with without walking students to classes andstanding guard all night thats right said ron catching on why dont you leave us here sirweve only got one more corridor to go you know weasley i think i will said lockhart i really should goand prepare my next class and he hurried offprepare his class ron sneered after him gone to curl his hairmore likethey let the rest of the gryffindors draw ahead of them then darteddown a side passage and hurried off toward moaning myrtlesbathroom but just as they were congratulating each other on theirbrilliant schemepotter weasley what are you doingit was professor mcgonagall and her mouth was the thinnest of thinlineswe were we were ron stammered we were going to to go andsee hermione said harry ron and professor mcgonagall both lookedat himwe havent seen her for ages professor harry went on hurriedlytreading on rons foot and we thought wed sneak into the hospitalwing you know and tell her the mandrakes are nearly ready and ernot to worry professor mcgonagall was still staring at him and for a momentharry thought she was going to explode but when she spoke it was ina strangely croaky voiceof course she said and harry amazed saw a tear glistening in herbeady eye of course i realize this has all been hardest on the friendsof those who have been i quite understand yespotter of course you may visit miss granger i will inform professorbinns where youve gone tell madam pomfrey i have given mypermissionharry and ron walked away hardly daring to believe that theydavoided detention as they turned the corner they distinctly heardprofessor mcgonagall blow her nosethat said ron fervently was the best story youve ever come upwiththey had no choice now but to go to the hospital wing and tell madampomfrey that they had professor mcgonagalls permission to visithermionemadam pomfrey let them in but reluctantlytheres just no point talking to a petrified person she said and theyhad to admit she had a point when theyd taken their seats next tohermione it was plain that hermione didnt have the faintest inklingthat she had visitors and that they might just as well tell her bedsidecabinet not to worry for all the good it would dowonder if she did see the attacker though said ron looking sadlyat hermiones rigid face because if he sneaked up on them all noonell ever know but harry wasnt looking at hermiones face he was more interestedin her right hand it lay clenched on top of her blankets and bendingcloser he saw that a piece of paper was scrunched inside her fistmaking sure that madam pomfrey was nowhere near he pointed thisout to rontg and get it out ron whispered shifting his chair so that heblocked harry from madam pomfreys viewit was no easy task hermiones hand was clamped so tightly aroundthe paper that harry was sure he was going to tear it while ron keptwatch he tugged and twisted and at last after several tense minutesthe paper came freeit was a page torn from a very old library book harry smoothed it outeagerly and ron leaned close to read it tooof the many fearsome beasts and monsters that roam our landthere is none more curious or more deadly than the basiliskknown also as the king of serpents this snake which mayreach gigantic size and live many hundreds of years is bornfrom a chickens egg hatched beneath a toad its methods of killing aremost wondrous for aside from its deadly and venomous fangs the basiliskhas a murderous stare and all who are fixed with the beam of its eye shallsuffer instant death spiders flee before the basilisk for it is their mortalenemy and the basilisk flees only from the crowing of the rooster which isfatal to itand beneath this a single word had been written in a hand harryrecognized as hermiones pipesit was as though somebody had just flicked a light on in his brainron he breathed this is it this is the answer the monster in thechambers a basilisk a giant serpent that why ive been hearingthat voice all over the place and nobody else has heard it its becausei understand parseltongue harry looked up at the beds around himthe basilisk kills people by looking at them but no ones died because no one looked it straight in the eye colin saw it through hiscamera the basilisk burned up all the film inside it but colin just gotpetrified justin justin mustve seen the basilisk through nearlyheadless nick nick got the full blast of it but he couldnt die again and hermione and that ravenclaw prefect were found with amirror next to them hermione had just realized the monster was abasilisk i bet you anything she warned the first person she met tolook around corners with a mirror first and that girl pulled out hermirror and rods jaw had droppedand mrs norris he whispered eagerlyharry thought hard picturing the scene on the night of halloweenthe water he said slowly the flood from moaning myrtlesbathroom i bet you mrs norris only saw the reflection he scanned the page in his hand eagerly the more he looked at itthe more it made sensethe crowing of the rooster is fatal to it he read aloud hagridsroosters were killed the heir of slytherin didnt want one anywherenear the castle once the chamber was opened spidersflee before it itall fitsbut hows the basilisk been getting around the place said ron agiant snake someone wouldve seen harry however pointed at the word hermione had scribbled at thefoot of the pagepipes he said pipes ron its been using the plumbing ivebeen hearing that voice inside the walls ron suddenly grabbed harrys armthe entrance to the chamber of secrets he said hoarselywhat if its a bathroom what if its in moaning myrtles bathroom said harrythey sat there excitement coursing through them hardly ableto believe itthis means said harry i cant be the only parselmouth inthe school the heir of slytherins one too thats how hes beencontrolling the basiliskwhatre we going to do said ron whose eyes were flashingshould we go straight to mcgonagalllets go to the staff room said harry jumping up shell bethere in ten minutes its nearly breakthey ran downstairs not wanting to be discovered hangingaround in another corridor they went straight into the desertedstaff room it was a large paneled room full of dark wooden chairsharry and ron paced around it too excited to sit downbut the bell to signal break never cameinstead echoing through the corridors came professor mcgonagalls voice magically magnifiedall students to return to their house dormitories at once all teachers return to the staff room immediately please harry wheeled around to stare at ronnot another attack not nowwhatll we do said ron aghast go back to the dormitoryno said harry glancing around there was an ugly sort ofwardrobe to his left full of the teachers cloaks in here lets hearwhat its all about then we can tell them what weve found outthey hid themselves inside it listening to the rumbling of hundreds ofpeople moving overhead and the staff room door banging openfrom between the musty folds of the cloaks they watched theteachers filtering into the room some of them were looking puzzledothers downright scared then professor mcgonagall arrivedit has happened she told the silent staff room a student has beentaken by the monster right into the chamber itselfprofessor flitwick let out a squeal professor sprout clapped herhands over her mouth snape gripped the back of a chair very hardand said how can you be surethe heir of slytherin said professor mcgonagall who was

mcgonagalltonight will be an excellent time to do it well make sure everyonesout of your way youll be able to tackle the monster all by youself afree rein at lastlockhart gazed desperately around him but nobody came to therescue he didnt look remotely handsome anymore his lip wastrembling and in the absence of his usually toothy grin he lookedweakchinned and feeblev very well he said ill ill be in

students what has happened tell them thehogwarts express will take them home first thing tomorrow will therest of you please make sure no students have been left outside theirdormitoriesthe teachers rose and left one by oneit was probably the worst day of harrys entire life he ron fredand george sat together in a corner of the gryffindor common roomunable to say anything to each other percy wasnt there he had goneto send an owl to mr and mrs weasley then shut himself up in hisdormitoryno afternoon ever lasted as long as that one nor had gryffindortower ever been so crowded yet so quiet near

try and get into thechamber we can tell him where we think it is and tell him its abasilisk in therebecause harry couldnt think of anything else to do and because hewanted to be doing something he agreed the gryffindors aroundthem were so miserable and felt so sorry for the weasleys thatnobody tried to stop them as they got up crossed the room and leftthrough the portrait holedarkness was falling as they walked down to lockharts officethere seemed to be a lot of activity going on inside it they could hearscraping thumps and hurried footstepsharry knocked and there was a sudden silence from inside then thedoor opened the tiniest crack and they saw one of lockharts eyespeering through itoh mr potter mr weasley he said opening the door a bitwider im rather busy at the moment if you would be quick professor weve got some information for you said harry wethink itll help youer well its not terribly the side of lockharts face that theycould see looked very uncomfortable i mean well all right he opened the door and they enteredhis office had been almost completely stripped two large trunksstood open on the floor robes jadegreen lilac midnightblue hadbeen hastily folded into one of them books were jumbled untidily intothe other the photographs that had covered the walls were nowcrammed into boxes on the deskare you going somewhere said harryer well yes said lockhart ripping a lifesize poster of himself fromthe back of the door as he spoke and starting to roll it up urgent call unavoidable got to go what about my sister said ron jerkilywell as to that most unfortunate said lockhart avoiding theireyes as he wrenched open a drawer and started emptying the contentsinto a bag no one regrets more than i youre the defense against the dark arts teacher said harryyou cant go

frowning at harrydo use your common sense my books wouldnt have sold half aswell if people didnt think id done all those things no one wants toread about some ugly old armenian warlock even if he did save avillage from werewolves hed look dreadful on the front cover nodress sense at all and the witch who banished the bandon bansheehad a harelip i mean come on so youve just been taking credit for what a load of other people havedone said harry incredulouslyharry harry said lockhart shaking his head impatiently its notnearly as simple as that there was work involved i hadto track these people down ask them exactly how they managed todo what they did then i had to put a memory charm on them so theywouldnt remember doing it if theres one thing i pride myself on itsmy memory charms no its been a lot of work harry its not allbook signings and publicity photos you know you want fame youhave to be prepared for a long hard sloghe banged the lids of his trunks shut and locked themlets see he said i think thats everything yes only one thinglefthe pulled out his wand and turned to themawfully sorry boys but ill have to put a memory charm on younow cant have you blabbing my secrets all over the place id neversell another book harry reached his wand just in time lockhart had barely raised hiswhen harry bellowed expelliarmuslockhart was blasted backward falling over his trunk his wand flewhigh into the air ron caught it and flung it out of the open windowshouldnt have let professor snape teach us that one said harryfuriously kicking lockharts trunk aside lockhart was looking up athim feeble once more harry was still pointing his wand at himwhat dyou want me to do said lockhart weakly i dont knowwhere the chamber of secrets is theres nothing i can doyoure in luck said harry forcing lockhart to his feet at wandpointwe think we know where it is and whats inside it lets gothey marched lockhart out of his office and down the nearest stairsalong the dark corridor where the messages shone on the wall to thedoor of moaning myrtles bathroomthey sent lockhart in first harry was pleased to see that he wasshakingmoaning myrtle was sitting on the tank of the end toiletoh its you she said when she saw harry what do you want thistimeto ask you how you died said harrymyrtles whole aspect changed at once she looked as though she hadnever been asked such a flattering questionooooh it was dreadful she said with relish it happened right inhere i died in this very stall i remember it so well id hidden becauseolive hornby was teasing me about my glasses the door was lockedand i was crying and then i heard somebody come in they saidsomething funny a different language i think it must have beenanyway what really got me was that it was a boy speaking so iunlocked the door to tell him to go and use his own toilet and then myrtle swelled importantly her face shining i diedhow said harryno idea said myrtle in hushed tones i just remember seeing a pairof great big yellow eyes my whole body sort of seized up and then iwas floating away she looked dreamily at harry and then icame back again i was determined to haunt olive hornby you seeoh she was sorry shed ever laughed at my glasseswhere exactly did you see the eyes said harrysomewhere there said myrtle pointing vaguely toward the sink infront of her toiletharry and ron hurried over to it lockhart was standing well back alook of utter terror on his faceit looked like an ordinary sink they examined every inch of it insideand out including the pipes below and then harry saw it scratchedon the side of one of the copper taps was a tiny snakethat taps never worked said myrtle brightly as he tried to turn itharry said ron say something something in parseltonguebut harry thought hard the only times hed ever managed tospeak parseltongue were when hed been faced with a real snake hestared hard at the tiny engraving trying to imagine it was realopen up he saidhe looked at ron who shook his headenglish he saidharry looked back at the snake willing himself to believe it was aliveif he moved his head the candlelight made it look as though it weremovingopen up he saidexcept that the words werent what he heard a strange hissing hadescaped him and at once the tap glowed with a brilliant white light andbegan to spin next second the sink began to move the sink in factsank right out of sight leaving a large pipe exposed a pipe wideenough for a man to slide intoharry heard ron gasp and looked up again he had made up his mindwhat he was going to doim going down there he said he couldnt not go not now they had found the entrance to thechamber not if there was even the faintest slimmest wildest chancethat ginny might be aliveme too said ronthere was a pausewell you hardly seem to need me said lockhart with a shadowof his old smile ill just he put his hand on the door knob but ron and harry both pointedtheir wands at himyou can go first ron snarledwhitefaced and wandless lockhart approached the openingboys he said his voice feeble boys what good will it doharry jabbed him in the back with his wand lockhart slid his legsinto the pipei really dont think he started to say but ron gave him a pushand he slid out of sight harry followed quickly he lowered himselfslowly into the pipe then let goit was like rushing down an endless slimy dark slide he could seemore pipes branching off in all directions but none as large as theirswhich twisted and turned sloping steeply downward and he knewthat he was falling deeper below the school than even the dungeonsbehind him he could hear ron thudding slightly at the curvesand then just as he had begun to worry about what would happenwhen he hit the ground the pipe leveled out and he shot out of theend with a wet thud landing on the damp floor of a dark stone tunnellarge enough to stand in lockhart was getting to hisfeet a little ways away covered in slime and white as a ghost harrystood aside as ron came whizzing out of the pipe toowe must be miles under the school said harry his voice echoing inthe black tunnelunder the lake probably said ron squinting around at the darkslimy wallsall three of them turned to stare into the darkness aheadlumos harry muttered to his wand and it lit again cmon hesaid to ron and lockhart and off they went their footsteps slappingloudly on the wet floorthe tunnel was so dark that they could only see a little distance aheadtheir shadows on the wet walls looked monstrous in the wandlightremember harry said quietly as they walked cautiously forwardany sign of movement close your eyes right away but the tunnel was quiet as the grave and the first unexpected soundthey heard was a loud crunch as ron stepped on what turned out to bea rats skull harry lowered his wand to look at the floor and saw thatit was littered with small animal bones trying very hard not toimagine what ginny might look like if they found her harry led theway forward around a dark bend in the tunnelharry theres something up there said ron hoarsely grabbingharrys shoulderthey froze watching harry could just see the outline of somethinghuge and curved lying right across the tunnel it wasnt movingmaybe its asleep he breathed glancing back at the other twolockharts hands were pressed over his eyes harry turned back tolook at the thing his heart beating so fast it hurtvery slowly his eyes as narrow as he could make them and still seeharry edged forward his wand held highthe light slid over a gigantic snake skin of a vivid poisonous greenlying curled and empty across the tunnel floor the creature that hadshed it must have been twenty feet long at leastblimey said ron weaklythere was a sudden movement behind them gilderoy lockhartsknees had given wayget up said ron sharply pointing his wand at lockhartlockhart got to his feet then he dived at ron knocking him to thegroundharry jumped forward but too late lockhart was straightening uppanting rons wand in his hand and a gleaming smile back on hisfacethe adventure ends here boys he said i shall take a bit of thisskin back up to the school tell them i was too late to save the girland that you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of hermangled body say goodbye to your memorieshe raised rons spellotaped wand high over his head and yelledobliviatethe wand exploded with the force of a small bomb harry flung hisarms over his head and ran slipping over the coils of snake skin outof the way of great chunks of tunnel ceiling that were thundering tothe floor next moment he was standing alone gazing at a solid wallof broken rockron he shouted are you okay ronim here came rons muffled voice from behind the rockfall imokay this gits not though he got blasted by the wand there was a dull thud and a loud ow it sounded as though ron hadjust kicked lockhart in the shinswhat now rons voice said sounding desperate we cant getthrough itll take ages harry looked up at the tunnel ceiling huge cracks had appeared in ithe had never tried to break apart anything as large as these rocks bymagic and now didnt seem a good moment to try what if the wholetunnel caved inthere was another thud and another ow from behind the rocksthey were wasting time ginny had already been in the chamber ofsecrets for hours harry knew there was only one thing to dowait there he called to ron wait with lockhart ill go on if imnot back in an hour there was a very pregnant pauseill try and shift some of this rock said ron who seemed to be tryingto keep his voice steady so you can can get back through andharry see you in a bit said harry trying to inject some confidence into hisshaking voiceand he set off alone past the giant snake skinsoon the distant noise of ron straining to shift the rocks was gonethe tunnel turned and turned again every nerve in harrys body wastingling unpleasantly he wanted the tunnel to end yet dreaded whathed find when it did and then at last as he crept around yet anotherbend he saw a solid wall ahead on which two entwined serpents werecarved their eyes set with great glinting emeraldsharry approached his throat very dry there was no need to pretendthese stone snakes were real their eyes looked strangely alivehe could guess what he had to do he cleared his throat and theemerald eyes seemed to flickeropen said harry in a low faint hissthe serpents parted as the wall cracked open the halves slid smoothlyout of sight and harry shaking from head to foot walked insidee was standing at the end of a very long dimly lit chamber toweringstone pillars entwined with more carved serpents rose to support aceiling lost in darkness casting long black shadows through the oddgreenish gloom that filled the placehis heart beating very fast harry stood listening to the chill silencecould the basilisk be lurking in a shadowy corner behind a pillar andwhere was ginnyhe pulled out his wand and moved forward between the serpentinecolumns every careful footstep echoed loudly off the shadowy wallshe kept his eyes narrowed ready to clamp them shut at the smallestsign of movement the hollow eye sockets of the stone snakesseemed to be following him more than once with a jolt of thestomach he thought he saw one stirthen as he drew level with the last pair of pillars a statue high as thechamber itself loomed into view standing against the back wallharry had to crane his neck to look up into the giant face above itwas ancient and monkeyish with a long thin beard that fell almost tothe bottom of the wizards sweeping stone robes where twoenormous gray feet stood on the smooth chamber floor and betweenthe feet facedown lay a small blackrobed figure with flamingredhairtinny harry muttered sprinting to her and dropping to his kneestinny dont be dead please dont be dead he flung his wandaside grabbed ginnys shoulders and turned her over her face waswhite as marble and as cold yet her eyes were closed so she wasntpetrified but then she must beginny please wake up harry muttered desperately shaking herginnys head lolled hopelessly from side to sideshe wont wake said a soft voiceharry jumped and spun around on his kneesa tall blackhaired boy was leaning against the nearest pillarwatching he was strangely blurred around the edges as thoughharry were looking at him through a misted window but there wasno mistaking himtom tom riddleriddle nodded not taking his eyes off harrys facewhat dyou mean she wont wake harry said desperately shesnot shes not shes still alive said riddle but only justharry stared at him tom riddle had been at hogwarts fifty yearsago yet here he stood a weird misty light shining about him not a dayolder than sixteenare you a ghost harry said uncertainlya memory said riddle quietly preserved in a diary for fifty yearshe pointed toward the floor near the statues giant toes lying openthere was the little black diary harry had found in moaning myrtlesbathroom for a second harry wondered how it had got there butthere were more pressing matters to deal withyouve got to help me tom harry said raising ginnys head againweve got to get her out of here theres a basilisk i dont knowwhere it is but it could be along any moment please help me riddle didnt move harry sweating managed to hoist ginny half offthe floor and bent to pick up his wand againbut his wand had gonedid you see he looked up riddle was still watching him twirling harrys wandbetween his long fingersthanks said harry stretching out his hand for ita smile curled the corners of riddles mouth he continued to stare atharry twirling the wand idlylisten said harry urgently his knees sagging with ginnys deadweight weve got to go if the basilisk comes it wont come until it is called said riddle calmlyharry lowered ginny back onto the floor unable to hold her up anylongerwhat dyou

broadly and hepocketed harrys wandharry stared at him there was something very funny going on herehow did ginny get like this he asked slowlywell thats an interesting question said riddle pleasantly and quitea long story i suppose the real reason ginny weasleys like this isbecause she opened her heart and spilled all her secrets to an invisiblestrangerwhat are you talking about said harrythe

everunderstood me like you tom im so glad ive got this diary toconfide in its like having a friend i can carry around in my pocket riddle laughed a high cold laugh that didnt suit him it made the hairsstand up on the back of harrys neckif i say it myself harry ive always been able to charm the people ineeded so ginny poured out her soul to me and her soul happened tobe exactly what i wanted i grew stronger and stronger on a diet ofher deepest fears her darkest secrets i grew powerful far morepowerful than little miss weasley powerful enough to start feedingmiss weasley a few of my secrets to start pouring a little of my soulback into her what dyou mean said harry whose mouth had gone very dryhavent you guessed yet harry potter said riddle softly ginnyweasley opened the chamber of secrets she strangled the schoolroosters and daubed threatening messages on the walls she set theserpent of slytherin on four mudbloods and the squibs catno harry whisperedyes said riddle calmly of course she didnt know what she wasdoing at first it was very amusing i wish you could have seen hernew diary entries far more interesting they became dear tomhe recited watching harrys horrified face i think im losing mymemory there are rooster feathers all over my robes and dont know howthey got there dear tom l cant remember what did on the night ofhalloween but a cat was attacked and ive got paint all down my frontdear tom percy keeps telling me im pale and im not myself i think hesuspects me there was another attack todayand i dont know where i was tom what am i going to do i think imgoing mad i think im the one attacking everyone tomharrys fists were clenched the nails digging deep into his palmsit took a very long time for stupid little ginny to stop trusting herdiary said riddle but she finally became suspicious and tried todispose of it and thats where you came in harry you found it and icouldnt have been more delighted of all the people who could havepicked it up it was you the very person i was most anxious to meet and why did you want to meet me said harry anger was coursingthrough him and it was an effort to keep his voice steadywell you see ginny told me all about you harry said riddle yourwhole fascinating history his eyes roved over the lightning scar onharrys forehead and their expression grew hungrier i knew i mustfind out more about you talk to you meet you if i could so i decidedto show you my famous capture of that great oaf hagrid to gain yourtrust hagrids my friend said harry his voice now shaking and youframed him didnt you i thought you made a mistake but riddle laughed his high laugh againit was my word against hagrids harry well you can imagine howit looked to old armando dippet on the one hand tom riddle poorbut brilliant parentless but so brave school prefect model student on the other hand big blundering hagrid in trouble every other weektrying to raise werewolf cubs under his bed sneaking off to theforbidden forest to wrestle trolls but il admit even i was surprised how well the plan worked i thoughtsomeone must realize that hagrid couldnt possibly be the heir ofslytherin it had taken me five whole years to find out everything icould about the chamber of secrets and discover the secret entranceas though hagrid had the brains or the poweronly the transfiguration teacher dumbledore seemed to thinkhagrid was innocent he persuaded dipper to keep hagrid and trainhim as gamekeeper yes i think dumbledore might have guessed dumbledore never seemed to like me as much as the other teachersdid i bet dumbledore saw right through you said harry his teeth grittedwell he certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after hagridwas expelled said riddle carelessly i knew it wouldnt be safe toopen the chamber again while i was still at school but i wasnt goingto waste those long years id spent searching for it i decided to leavebehind a diary preserving my sixteenyearold self in its pages so thatone day with luck i would be able to lead another in my footsteps andfinish salazar slytherins noble workwell you havent finished it said harry triumphantly no ones diedthis time not even the cat in a few hours the mandrake draught willbe ready and everyone who was petrified will be all right again havent i already told you said riddle quietly that killing mudbloodsdoesnt matter to me anymore for many months now my new targethas been youharry stared at himimagine how angry i was when the next time my diary wasopened it was ginny who was writing to me not you she saw youwith the diary you see and panicked what if you found out how towork it and i repeated all her secrets to you what if even worse itold you whod been strangling roosters so the foolish little brat waiteduntil your dormitory was deserted and stole it back but i knew what imust do it was clear to me that you were on the trail of slytherinsheir from everything ginny had told me about you i knew you wouldgo to any lengths to solve the mystery particularly if one of your best friends was attacked and ginny hadtold me the whole school was buzzing because you could speakparseltongue so i made ginny write her own farewell on the wall and come downhere to wait she struggled and cried and became very boring butthere isnt much life left in her she put too much into the diary intome enough to let me leave its pages at last i have been waiting foryou to appear since we arrived here i knew youd come i have manyquestions for you harry potterlike what harry spat fists still clenchedwell said riddle smiling pleasantly how is it that you a skinny boywith no extraordinary magical talent managed to defeat the greatestwizard of all time how did you escape with nothing but a scar whilelord voldemorts powers were destroyedthere was an odd red gleam in his hungry eyes nowwhy do you care how i escaped said harry slowly voldemort wasafter your time voldemort said riddle softly is my past present and future harrypotter he pulled harrys wand from his pocket and began to trace itthrough the air writing three shimmering wordstom marvolo riddlethen he waved the wand once and the letters of his namerearranged themselvesi am lord voldemortyou see he whispered it was a name i was already using athogwarts to my most intimate friends only of course you think iwas going to use my filthy muggle fathers name forever i in whoseveins runs the blood of salazar slytherin himself through mymothers side i keep the name of a foul common muggle whoabandoned me even before i was born just because he found out hiswife was a witch no harry i fashioned myself a new name aname i knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speakwhen i had become the greatest sorcerer in the worldharrys brain seemed to have jammed he stared numbly at riddleat the orphaned boy who had grown up to murder harrys ownparents and so many others at last he forced himself to peakyoure not he said his quiet voice full of hatrednot what snapped riddlenot the greatest sorcerer in the world said harry breathing fastsorry to disappoint you and all that but the greatest wizard in theworld is albus dumbledore everyone says so even when you werestrong you didnt dare try and take over at hogwarts dumbledoresaw through you when you were at school and he still frightens younow wherever youre hiding these days the smile had gone from riddles face to be replaced by a very uglylookdumbledores been driven out of this castle by the mere memory ofme he hissedhes not as gone as you might think harry retorted he wasspeaking at random wanting to scare riddle wishing rather thanbelieving it to be trueriddle opened his mouth but frozemusic was coming from somewhere riddle whirled around to staredown the empty chamber the music was growing louder it waseerie spinetingling unearthly it lifted the hair on harrys scalp andmade his heart feel as though it was swelling to twice its normal sizethen as the music reached such a pitch that harry felt it vibratinginside his own ribs flames erupted at the top of the nearest pillara crimson bird the size of a swan had appeared piping its weird musicto the vaulted ceiling it had a glittering golden tail as long as apeacocks and gleaming golden talons which were gripping a raggedbundlea second later the bird was flying straight at harry it dropped theragged thing it was carrying at his feet then landed heavily on hisshoulder as it folded its great wings harry looked up and saw it had along sharp golden beak and a beady black eyethe bird stopped singing it sat still and warm next to harrys cheekgazing steadily at riddlethats a phoenix said riddle staring shrewdly back at itfawkes harry breathed and he felt the birds golden clawssqueeze his shoulder gentlyand that said riddle now eyeing the ragged thing that fawkes haddropped thats the old school sorting hat so it was patched frayed and dirty the hat lay motionless at harrysfeetriddle began to laugh again he laughed so hard that the darkchamber rang with it as though ten riddles were laughing at oncethis is what dumbledore sends his defender a songbird and an oldhat do you feel brave harry potter do you feel safe nowharry didnt answer he might not see what use fawkes or thesorting hat were but he was no longer alone and he waited forriddle to stop laughing with his courage mountingto business harry said riddle still smiling broadly twice in yourpast in my future we have met and twice i failed to kill you howdid you survive tell me everything the longer you talk he addedsoftly the longer you stay aliveharry was thinking fast weighing his chances riddle had the wandhe harry had fawkes and the sorting hat neither of which wouldbe much good in a duel it looked bad all right but the longer riddlestood there the more life was dwindling out of ginny and in themeantime harry noticed suddenly riddles outline was becomingclearer more solid if it had to be a fight between him and riddlebetter sooner than laterno one knows why you lost your powers when you attacked mesaid harry abruptly i dont know myself but i know why youcouldnt kill me because my mother died to save me my commonmuggleborn mother he added shaking with suppressed rage shestopped you killing me and ive seen the real you i saw you lastyear youre a wreck youre barely alive thats where all yourpower got you youre in hiding youre ugly youre foul riddles face contorted then he forced it into an awful smile soyour mother died to save you yes thats a powerful countercharm ican see now there is nothing special about you after all iwondered you see there are strange likenesses between us after alleven you must have noticed both halfbloods orphans raised bymuggles probably the only two parselmouths to come to hogwartssince the great slytherin himself we even look something alike butafter all it was merely a lucky chance that saved you from me thatsall i wanted to knowharry stood tense waiting for riddle to raise his wand but riddlestwisted smile was widening againnow harry im going to teach you a little lesson lets match thepowers of lord voldemort heir of salazar slytherin against famousharry potter and the best weapons dumbledore can give him he cast an amused eye over fawkes and the sorting hat then walkedaway harry fear spreading up his numb legs watched ridthe stopbetween the high pillars and look up into the stone face of slytherinhigh above him in the halfdarkness riddle opened his mouth wide andhissed but harry understood what he was saying speak to me slytherin greatest of the hogwarts four harry wheeled around to look up at the statue fawkes swaying on hisshoulderslytherins gigantic stone face was moving horrorstruck harry sawhis mouth opening wider and wider to make a huge black holeand something was stirring inside the statues mouth somethingwas slithering up from its depths harry backed away until he hit the dark chamber wall and as he shuthis eyes tight he felt fawkes wing sweep his cheek as he took flightharry wanted to shout dont leave me but what chance did aphoenix have against the king of serpentssomething huge hit the stone floor of the chamber harry felt itshudder he knew what was happening he could sense it couldalmost see the giant serpent uncoiling itself from slytherins mouththen he heard riddles hissing voicekill him the basilisk was moving toward harry he could hear its heavy bodyslithering heavily across the dusty floor eyes still tightly shut harrybegan to run blindly sideways his hands outstretched feeling his way voldemort was laughingharry tripped he fell hard onto the stone and tasted blood the serpentwas barely feet from him he could hear it comingthere was a loud explosive spitting sound right above him and thensomething heavy hit harry so hard that he was smashed into the wallwaiting for fangs to sink through his body he heard more mad hissingsomething thrashing wildly off the pillarshe couldnt help it he opened his eyes wide enough to squint at whatwas going onthe enormous serpent bright poisonous green thick as an oak trunkhad raised itself high in the air and its great blunt head was weavingdrunkenly between the pillars as harry trembled ready to close hiseyes if it turned he saw what had distracted the snakefawkes was soaring around its head and the basilisk was snappingfuriously at him with fangs long and thin as sabersfawkes dived his long golden beak sank out of sight and asudden shower of dark blood spattered the floor the snakes tailthrashed narrowly missing harry and before harry could shut hiseyes it turned harry looked straight into its face and saw that itseyes both its great bulbous yellow eyes had been punctured by thephoenix blood was streaming to the floor and the snake was spittingin agonyno harry heard riddle screaming leave the bird leavethe bird the boy is behind you you can still smellhim kill himithe blinded serpent swayed confused still deadly fawkes wascircling its head piping his eerie song jabbing here and there at itsscaly nose as the blood poured from its ruined eyeshelp me help me harry muttered wildly someone anyonethe snakes tail whipped across the floor again harry duckedsomething soft hit his facethe basilisk had swept the sorting hat into harrys arms harryseized it it was all he had left his only chance he rammed it onto hishead and threw himself flat onto the floor as the basilisks tail swungover him againhelp me help me harry thought his eyes screwed tight under the hatplease help methere was no answering voice instead the hat contracted as thoughan invisible hand was squeezing it very tightlysomething very hard and heavy thudded onto the top of harrys headalmost knocking him out stars winking in front of his eyes he grabbedthe top of the hat to pull it off and felt something long and hardbeneath ita gleaming silver sword had appeared inside the hat its handleglittering with rubies the size of eggskill the boy leave the bird the boy is behind yousniff smell himharry was on his feet ready the basilisks head was falling its bodycoiling around hitting pillars as it twisted to face him he could see thevast bloody eye sockets see the mouth stretching wide wide enoughto swallow him whole lined with fangs long as his sword thinglittering venomous it lunged blindly harry dodged and it hit the chamber wall it lungedagain and its forked tongue lashed harrys side he raised the swordin both his hands the basilisk lunged again and this time its aim was true harry threwhis whole weight behind the sword and drove it to the hilt into the roofof the serpents mouth but as warm blood drenched harrys arms he felt a searing pain justabove his elbow one long poisonous fang was sinking deeper anddeeper into his arm and it splintered as the basilisk keeled oversideways and fell twitching to the floorharry slid down the wall he gripped the fang that was spreadingpoison through his body and wrenched it out of his arm but he knew itwas too late whitehot pain was spreading slowly and steadily fromthe wound even as he dropped the fang and watched his own bloodsoaking his robes his vision went foggy the chamber was dissolvingin a whirl of dull colora patch of scarlet swam past and harry heard a soft clatter of clawsbeside himfawkes said harry thickly you were fantastic fawkes he felt the bird lay its beautiful head on the spot where the serpentsfang had pierced himhe could hear echoing footsteps and then a dark shadow moved infront of himyoure dead harry potter said riddles voice above him deadeven dumbledores bird knows it do you see what hes doing potterhes cryingharry blinked fawkes head slid in and out of focus thick pearly tearswere trickling down the glossy feathersim going to sit here and watch you die harry potter take

defeated at last bythe dark lord he so unwisely challenged youll be back with your dearmudblood mother soon harry she bought you twelve years ofborrowed time but lord voldemort got you in the end as you knewhe must if this is dying thought harry its not so badeven the pain was leaving him but was this dying instead of going black the chamber seemed to becoming back into focus harry gave his head a little shake and there wasfawkes still resting his head on harrys arm a pearly patch of tears wasshining all around the wound except that there was no woundget away bird said riddles voice suddenly get away from him i said get away harry raised his head riddle was pointing harrys wand atfawkes there was a bang like a gun and fawkes took flight again in awhirl of gold and scarletphoenix tears said riddle quietly staring at harrys arm ofcourse healing powers i forgot he looked into harrys face but it makes no difference in fact iprefer it this way just you and me harry potter you and mehe raised the wandthen in a rush of wings fawkes had soared back overhead andsomething fell into harrys lap the diaryfor a split second both harry and riddle wand still raised stared at itthen without thinking without considering as though he had meant todo it all along harry seized the basilisk fang on the floor next to himand plunged it straight into the heart of the bookthere was a long dreadful piercing scream ink spurted out of thediary in torrents streaming over harrys hands flooding the floorriddle was writhing and twisting screaming and flailing and thenhe had gone harrys wand fell to the floor with a clatter and therewas silence silence except for the steady drip drip of ink still oozingfrom the diary the basilisk venom had burned a sizzling hole rightthrough itshaking all over harry pulled himself up his head was spinning asthough hed just traveled miles by floo powder slowly he gatheredtogether his wand and the sorting hat and with a huge tug retrievedthe glittering sword from the roof of the basilisks mouththen came a faint moan from the end of the chamber ginny wasstirring as harry hurried toward her she sat up her bemusedeyes traveled from the huge form of the dead basilisk over harry inhis bloodsoaked robes then to the diary in his hand she drew a greatshuddering gasp and tears began to pour down her faceharry oh harry i tried to tell you at bbreakfast but i ccouldntsay it in front of percy it was me harry but i i sswear i ddiddtmean to rriddle made me he ttook me over and howdid you kill that that thing wwheres riddle the last thing i rrememberis him

hovering in the chamber entranceharry urged ginny forward they stepped over the motionless coils ofthe dead basilisk through the echoing gloom and back into the tunnelharry heard the stone doors close behind them with a soft hissafter a few minutes progress up the dark tunnel a distant sound ofslowly shifting rock reached harrys earsron harry yelled speeding up ginnys okay ive got herhe heard ron give a strangled cheer and they turned the next bend tosee his eager face staring through the sizable gap he had managed tomake in the rock fallginny ron thrust an arm through the gap in the rock to pullher through first youre alive i dont believe it what happenedhow what where did that bird come fromfawkes had swooped through the gap after ginnyhes dumbledores said harry squeezing through himselfhow come youve got a sword said ron gaping at the glitteringweapon in harrys handill explain when we get out of here said harry with a sidewaysglance at ginny who was crying harder than everbut later harry said shortly he didnt think it was a good idea to tellron yet whod been opening the chamber not in front of ginnyanyway wheres lockhartback there said ron still looking puzzled but jerking his head up thetunnel toward the pipe hes in a bad way come and seeled by fawkes whose wide scarlet wings emitted a soft golden glowin the darkness they walked all the way back to the mouth of the pipegilderoy lockhart was sitting there humming placidly to himselfhis memorys gone said ron the memory charm backfired hithim instead of us hasnt got a clue who he is or where he is or whowe are i told him to come and wait here hes a danger to himselflockhart peered goodnaturedly up at them allhello he said odd sort of place this isnt it do you live hereno said ron raising his eyebrows at harryharry bent down and looked up the long dark pipehave you thought how were going to get back up this he said toronron shook his head but fawkes the phoenix had swooped past harryand was now fluttering in front of him his beady eyes bright in thedark he was waving his long golden tail feathers harry lookeduncertainly at himhe looks like he wants you to grab hold said ron lookingperplexed but youre much too heavy for a bird to pull up there fawkes said harry isnt an ordinary bird he turned quickly to theothers weve got to hold on to each other ginny grab rons handprofessor lockhart he means you said ron sharply to lockhartyou hold ginnys other hand harry tucked the sword and the sorting hat into his belt ron tookhold of the back of harrys robes and harry reached out and tookhold of fawkess strangely hot tail feathersan extraordinary lightness seemed to spread through his whole bodyand the next second in a rush of wings they were flying upwardthrough the pipe harry could hear lockhart dangling below himsaying amazing amazing this is just like magic the chill air waswhipping through harrys hair and before hed stopped enjoying theride it was over all four of them were hitting the wet floor ofmoaning myrtles bathroom and as lockhart straightened his hat thesink that hid the pipe was sliding back into placemyrtle goggled at themyoure alive she said blankly to harrytheres no need to sound so disappointed he said grimly wipingflecks of blood and slime off his glassesoh well id just been thinking if you had died youd have beenwelcome to share my toilet said myrtle blushing silverurgh said ron as they left the bathroom for the dark desertedcorridor outside harry i think myrtles grown fond of you youvegot competition ginnybut tears were still flooding silently down ginnys facewhere now said ron with an anxious look at ginny harry pointedfawkes was leading the way glowing gold along the corridor theystrode after him and moments later found themselves outsideprofessor mcgonagalls officeharry knocked and pushed the door openg fi a p t e irk i g t v v ndoy rewardor a moment there was silence as harry ron ginny and lockhartstood in the doorway covered in muck and slime and in harrys caseblood then there was a screamginnyit was mrs weasley who had been sitting crying in front of the fireshe leapt to her feet closely followed by mr weasley and both ofthem flung themselves on their daughterharry however was looking past them professor dumbledore wasstanding by the mantelpiece beaming next to professor mcgonagallwho was taking great steadying gasps clutching her chest fawkeswent whooshing past harrys ear and settled on dumbledoresshoulder just as harry found himself and ron being swept into mrsweasleys tight embraceyou saved her you saved her how did you do iti think wed all like to know that said professor mcgonagall weaklymrs weasley let go of harry who hesitated for a moment thenwalked over to the desk and laid upon it the sorting hat therubyencrusted sword and what remained of riddles diarythen he started telling them everything for nearly a quarter of anhour he spoke into the rapt silence he told them about hearing thedisembodied voice how hermione had finally realized that he washearing a basilisk in the pipes how he and ron had followed thespiders into the forest that aragog had told them where the lastvictim of the basilisk had died how he had guessed that moaningmyrtle had been the victim and that the entrance to the chamber ofsecrets might be in her bathroom very well professor mcgonagall prompted him as he paused soyou found out where the entrance was breaking a hundred schoolrules into pieces along the way i might add but how on earth didyou all get out of there alive potterso harry his voice now growing hoarse from all this talking toldthem about fawkess timely arrival and about the sorting hat givinghim the sword but then he faltered he had so far avoidedmentioning riddles diary or ginny she was standing with herhead against mrs weasleys shoulder and tears were still coursingsilently down her cheeks what if they expelled her harry thought inpanic riddles diary didnt work anymore how could they proveit had been he whod made her do it allinstinctively harry looked at dumbledore who smiled faintly thefirelight glancing off his halfmoon spectacleswhat interests me most said dumbledore gently is how lordvoldemort managed to enchant ginny when my sources tell me he iscurrently in hiding in the forests of albaniarelief warm sweeping glorious relief swept over harry wwhatsthat said mr weasley in a stunned voice youknowwhoenenchant ginny but ginnys not ginny hasnt been has sheit was this diary said harry quickly picking it up and showing it todumbledore riddle wrote it when he was sixteen dumbledore took the diary from harry and peered keenly down hislong crooked nose at its burnt and soggy pagesbrilliant he said softly of course he was probably the mostbrilliant student hogwarts has ever seen he turned around to theweasleys who were looking utterly bewilderedvery few people know that lord voldemort was once called tomriddle i taught him myself fifty years ago at hogwarts hedisappeared after leaving the school traveled far and wide sankso deeply into the dark arts consorted with the very worst of ourkind underwent so many dangerous magical transformations thatwhen he resurfaced as lord voldemort he was barely recognizablehardly anyone connected lord voldemort with the cleverhandsome boy who was once head boy herebut ginny said mrs weasley whats our ginny got to do with with himhis ddiaryl ginny sobbed ive bbeen writing in it and hes beenwwriting back all year tinny said mr weasley flabbergasted havent i taught youanything what have i always told you never trust anything that canthink for itself if you cant see where it keeps its brain why didntyou show the diary to me or your mother a suspicious object likethat it was clearly full of dark magic i ddidnt know sobbed ginny i found it inside one of the booksmum got me i ththought someone had just left it in there andforgotten about it miss weasley should go up to the hospital wing right awaydumbledore interrupted in a firm voice this has been a terribleordeal for her there will be no punishment older and wiser wizardsthan she have been hoodwinked by lord voldemort he strode overto the door and opened it bed rest and perhaps a large steamingmug of hot chocolate i always find that cheers me up he addedtwinkling kindly down at her you will find that madam pomfrey isstill awake shes just giving out mandrake juice i daresay thebasilisks victims will be waking up any momentso hermiones okay said ron brightlythere has been no lasting harm done ginny said dumbledoremrs weasley led ginny out and mr weasley followed still lookingdeeply shakenyou know minerva professor dumbledore said thoughtfully toprofessor mcgonagall i think all this merits a good feast might i askyou to go and alert the kitchensright said professor mcgonagall crisply also moving to the doorill leave you to deal with potter and weasley shall icertainly said dumbledoreshe left and harry and ron gazed uncertainly at dumbledore whatexactly had professor mcgonagall meant deal with them surely surely they werent about to be punishedi seem to remember telling you both that i would have to expel you ifyou broke any more school rules said dumbledoreron opened his mouth in horrorwhich goes to show that the best of us must sometimes eat ourwords dumbledore went on smiling you will both receive specialawards for services to the school and let me see yes i think twohundred points apiece for gryffindorron went as briglitly pink as lockharts valentine flowers and closedhis mouth againbut one of us seems to be keeping mightily quiet about his part in thisdangerous adventure dumbledore added why so modestgilderoyharry gave a start he had completely forgotten about lockhart heturned and saw that lockhart was standing in a corner of the roomstill wearing his vague smile when dumbledore addressed himlockhart looked over his shoulder to see who he was talking toprofessor dumbledore ron said quickly there was an accidentdown in the chamber of secrets professor lockhart am i a professor said lockhart in mild surprise goodness iexpect i was hopeless was ihe tried to do a memory charm and the wand backfired ronexplained quietly to dumbledoredear me said dumbledore shaking his head his long silvermustache quivering impaled upon your own sword gilderoysword said lockhart dimly havent got a sword that boy hasthough he pointed at harry hell lend you onewould you mind taking professor lockhart up to the infirmary toodumbledore said to ron id like a few more words with harry lockhart ambled out ron cast a curious look back at dumbledore andharry as he closed the doordumbledore crossed to one of the chairs by the firesit down harry he said and harry sat feeling unaccountablynervousfirst of all harry i want to thank you said dumbledore eyestwinkling again you must have shown me real loyalty down in thechamber nothing but that could have called fawkes to youhe stroked the phoenix which had fluttered down onto his kneeharry grinned awkwardly as dumbledore watched himand so you met tom riddle said dumbledore thoughtfully iimagine he was most interested in you suddenly something that was nagging at harry came tumbling out ofhis mouthprofessor dumbledore riddle said im like him strange likenesseshe said did he now said dumbledore looking thoughtfully at harry fromunder his thick silver eyebrows and what do you think harryi dont think im like him said harry more loudly than hed intendedi mean im im in gryffindor im but he fell silent a lurking doubt resurfacing in his mindprofessor he started again after a moment the sorting hat told meid id have done well in slytherin everyone thought i was slytherinsheir for a while because i can speak parseltongue you can speak parseltongue harry said dumbledore calmlybecause lord voldemort who is the last remaining ancestorof salazar slytherin can speak parseltongue unless im muchmistaken he transferred some of his own powers to you the night hegave you that scar not something he intended to do im sure voldemort put a bit of himself in me harry said thunderstruckit certainly seems soso i should be in slytherin harry said looking desperately intodumbledores face the sorting hat could see slytherins power inme and it put you in gryffindor said dumbledore calmly listen to me harryyou happen to have many qualities salazar slytherin prized in his handpickedstudents his own very rare gift parseltongue resourcefulness determination a certain disregard for rules headded his mustache quivering again yet the sorting hat placed youin gryffindor you know why that was thinkit only put me in gryffindor said harry in a defeated voice becausei asked not to go in slytherin exactly said dumbledore beaming once more which makes youvery different from tom riddle it is our choices harry that show whatwe truly are far more than our abilities harry sat motionless in hischair stunned if you want proof harry that you belong ingryffindor i suggest you look more closely at thisdumbledore reached across to professor mcgonagalls desk pickedup the bloodstained silver sword and handed it to harry dully harryturned it over the rubies blazing in the firelight and then he saw thename engraved just below the hiltgodric gryffindoronly a true gryffindor could have pulled that out of the hat harrysaid dumbledore simplyfor a minute neither of them spoke then dumbledore pulled openone of the drawers in professor mcgonagalls desk and took out a quilland a bottle of inkwhat you need harry is some food and sleep i suggest you go downto the feast while i write to azkaban we need our gamekeeperback and i must draft an advertisement for the daily prophet too headded thoughtfully well be needing a new defense against thedark arts teacher dear me we do seem to run through them dontweharry got up and crossed to the door he had just reached for thehandle however when the door burst open so violently that it bouncedback off the walllucius malfoy stood there fury in his face and cowering behind hislegs heavily wrapped in bandages was dobbygood evening lucius said dumbledore pleasantlymr malfoy almost knocked harry over as he swept into the roomdobby went scurrying in after him crouching at the hem of his cloaka look of abject terror on his facethe elf was carrying a stained rag with which he was attempting tofinish cleaning mr malfoys shoes apparently mr malfoy had set outin a great hurry for not only were his shoes halfpolished but hisusually sleek hair was disheveled ignoring the elf bobbingapologetically around his ankles he fixed his cold eyes upondumbledoreso he said youve come back the governors suspended you butyou still saw fit to return to hogwartswell you see lucius said dumbledore smiling serenely theother eleven governors contacted me today it was something likebeing caught in a hailstorm of owls to tell the truth theyd heard thatarthur weasleys daughter had been killed and wanted me back hereat once they seemed to think i was the best man for the job afterall very strange tales they told me too several of them seemedto think that you had threatened to curse their families if they didntagree to suspend me in the first placemr malfoy went even paler than usual but his eyes were still slits offuryso have you stopped the attacks yet he sneered have youcaught the culpritwe have said dumbledore with a smilewellsaid mr malfoy sharply who is itthe same person as last time lucius said dumbledore but thistime lord voldemort was acting through somebody else by meansof this diaryhe held up the small black book with the large hole through thecenter watching mr malfoy closely harry however was watchingdobbythe elf was doing something very odd his great eyes fixedmeaningfully on harry he kept pointing at the diary then at mrmalfoy and then hitting himself hard on the head with his fisti see said mr malfoy slowly to dumbledorea clever plan said dumbledore in a level voice still staring mrmalfoy straight in the eye because if harry here mr malfoy shotharry a swift sharp look and his friend ron hadnt discoveredthis book why ginny weasley might have taken allthe blame no one would ever have been able to prove she hadntacted of her own free will mr malfoy said nothing his face was suddenly masklikeand imagine dumbledore went on what might have happenedthen the weasleys are one of our most prominent purebloodfamilies imagine the effect on arthur weasley and his muggleprotection act if his own daughter was discovered attacking and killing muggleborns very fortunate the diary was discoveredand riddles memories wiped from it who knows what theconsequences might have been otherwise mr

several hogwarts feasts but never one quite likethis everybody was in their pajamas and the celebration lasted allnight harry didnt know whether the best bit was hermione runningtoward him screaming you solved it you solved it or justinhurrying over from the hufflepuff table to wring his hand andapologize endlessly for suspecting him or hagrid turning up at halfpast three cuffing harry and ron so hard on the shoulders that theywere knocked into their plates of trifle or his and rons four hundredpoints for gryffindor securing the house cup for the second yearrunning or professor mcgonagall standing up totell them all that the exams had been canceled as a school treat ohno said hermione or dumbledore announcing that unfortunatelyprofessor lockhart would be unable to return next year owing to thefact that he needed to go away and get his memory back quite a fewof the teachers joined in the cheering that greeted this newsshame said ron helping himself to a jam doughnut he wasstarting to grow on methe rest of the final term passed in a haze of blazing sunshinehogwarts was back to normal with only a few small differences defense against the dark arts classes were canceled but wevehad plenty of practice at that anyway ron told a disgruntledhermione and lucius malfoy had been sacked as a school governordraco was no longer strutting around the school as though he ownedthe place on the contrary he looked resentful and sulky on the otherhand ginny weasley was perfectly happy againtoo soon it was time for the journey home on the hogwarts expressharry ron hermione fred george and ginny got a compartment tothemselves they made the most of the last few hours in which theywere allowed to do magic before the holidays they played explodingsnap set off the very last of fred and georges filibuster fireworksand practiced disarming each other by magic harry was getting verygood at itthey were almost at kings cross when harry rememberedsomethingginny what did you see percy doing that he didnt want you to tellanyoneoh that said ginny giggling well percys got a girlfriend freddropped a stack of books on georges headwhatits that ravenclaw prefect penelope clearwater said ginnythats who he was writing to all last summer hes been meeting herall over the school in secret i walked in on them kissing in an emptyclassroom one day he was so upset when she was you know attacked you wont tease him will you she added anxiouslywouldnt dream of it said fred who was looking like his birthdayhad come earlydefinitely not said george sniggeringthe hogwarts express slowed and finally stoppedharry pulled out his quill and a bit of parchment and turned to ronand hermionethis is called a telephone number he told ron scribbling it twicetearing the parchment in two and handing it to them i told your dadhow to use a telephone last summer hell know call me at thedursleys okay i cant stand another two months with only dudleyto talk to your aunt and uncle will be proud though wont they saidhermione as they got off the train and joined the crowd throngingtoward the enchanted barrier when they hear what you did thisyearproud said harry are you crazy all those times i couldvedied and i didnt manage it theyll be furious and together they walked back through the gateway to the muggleworld chapter one owl postharry potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways for one thing he hated the summer holidays more than any other time of year for anotherhe really wanted to do his homework but was forced to do it in secretin the dead of night and he also happened to be a wizardit was nearly midnight and he was lying on his stomach in bed the blankets drawn right over his head like a tent a flashlight in one hand and a large leather bound book a history of magic by bathilda bagshot propped open against the pillow harry moved the tip of his eagle feather quill down the page frowning as he looked for something that would help him write his essay witch burning in the fourteenth century was completely pointless discussthe quill paused at the top of a likely looking paragraph harry pushed his round glasses up the bridge of his nose moved his flashlight closer to the book and readnon magic people more commonly known as muggles were particularly afraid of magic in medieval times but not very good at recognizing iton the rare occasion that they did catch a real witch or wizard burning had no effect whatsoever the witch or wizard would perform a basic flame freezing charm and then pretend to shriek with pain while enjoying a gentle tickling sensation indeed wendelin the weird enjoyed being burned so much that she allowed herself to be caught no less than fortyseven times in various disguisesharry put his quill between his teeth and reached underneath his pillow for his ink bottle and a roll of parchment slowly and very carefully he unscrewed the ink bottle dipped his quill into it and began to writepausing every now and then to listen because if any of the dursleys heard the scratching of his quill on their way to the bathroom hed probably find himself locked in the cupboard under the stairs for the rest of the summerthe dursley family of number four privet drive was the reason that harry never enjoyed his summer holidays uncle vernon aunt petunia andtheir son dudley were harrys only living relatives they were muggles and they had a very medieval attitude toward magic harrys dead parents who had been a witch and wizard themselves were never mentioned under the dursleys roof for years aunt petunia and uncle vernon had hoped that if they kept harry as downtrodden as possiblethey would be able to squash the magic out of him to their fury they had been unsuccessful these days they lived in terror of anyone finding out that harry had spent most of the last two years at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry the most they could do however was to lock away harrys spellbooks wand cauldron and broomstick at the start of the summer break and forbid him to talk to the neighborsthis separation from his spellbooks had been a real problem for harrybecause his teachers at hogwarts had given him a lot of holiday workone of the essays a particularly nasty one about shrinking potions was for harrys least favorite teacher professor snape who would be delighted to have an excuse to give harry detention for a month harry had therefore seized his chance in the first week of the holidays while uncle vernon aunt petunia and dudley had gone out into the front garden to admire uncle vernons new company car in very loud voices so that the rest of the street would notice it too harry had crept downstairs picked the lock on the cupboard under the stairs grabbed some of his books and hidden them in his bedroom as long as he didnt leave spots of ink on the sheets the dursleys need never know that he was studying magic by nightharry was particularly keen to avoid trouble with his aunt and uncle at the moment as they were already in an especially bad mood with him all because hed received a telephone call from a fellow wizard one week into the school vacationron weasley who was one of harrys best friends at hogwarts came from a whole family of wizards this meant that he knew a lot of things harry didnt but had never used a telephone before most unluckily it had been uncle vernon who had answered the callvernon dursley speakingharry who happened to be in the room at the time froze as he heard rons voice answerhello hello can you hear me i want to talk to harry potterron was yelling so loudly that uncle vernon jumped and held the receiver a foot away from his ear staring at it with an expression of mingled fury and alarmwho is this he roared in the direction of the mouthpiece who are youron weasley ron bellowed back as though he and uncle vernon were speaking from opposite ends of a football field im a friend of harrys from school uncle vernons small eyes swiveled around to harry who was rooted to the spotthere is no harry potter here he roared now holding the receiver at arms length as though frightened it might explode i dont know what school youre talking about never contact me againdont you come near my familyand he threw the receiver back onto the telephone as if dropping a poisonous spiderthe fight that had followed had been one of the worst everhow dare you give this number to people like people like you uncle vernon had roared spraying harry with spitron obviously realized that hed gotten harry into trouble because he hadnt called again harrys other best friend from hogwarts hermione granger hadnt been in touch either harry suspected that ron had warned hermione not to call which was a pity because hermione the cleverest witch in harrys year had muggle parents knew perfectly well how to use a telephone and would probably have had enough sense not to say that she went to hogwartsso harry had had no word from any of his wizarding friends for five long weeks and this summer was turning out to be almost as bad as the last one there was just one very small improvement after swearing that he wouldnt use her to send letters to any of his friends harry had been allowed to let his owl hedwig out at night uncle vernon had given in because of the racket hedwig made if she was locked in her cage all the timeharry finished writing about wendelin the weird and paused to listen again the silence in the dark house was broken only by the distantgrunting snores of his enormous cousin dudley it must be very lateharry thought his eyes were itching with tiredness perhaps hed finish this essay tomorrow nighthe replaced the top of the ink bottle pulled an old pillowcase from under his bed put the flashlight a history of magic his essay quilland ink inside it got out of bed and hid the lot under a loose floorboard under his bed then he stood up stretched and checked the time on the luminous alarm clock on his bedside tableit was one oclock in the morning harrys stomach gave a funny jolt he had been thirteen years old without realizing it for a whole houryet another unusual thing about harry was how little he looked forward to his birthdays he had never received a birthday card in his life the dursleys had completely ignored his last two birthdays and he had no reason to suppose they would remember this oneharry walked across the dark room past hedwigs large empty cage to the open window he leaned on the sill the cool night air pleasant on his face after a long time under the blankets hedwig had been absent for two nights now harry wasnt worried about her shed been gone this long before but he hoped shed be back soon she was the only living creature in this house who didnt flinch at the sight of himharry though still rather small and skinny for his age had grown a few inches over the last year his jet black hair however was just as it always had been stubbornly untidy whatever he did to it the eyes behind his glasses were bright green and on his forehead clearly visible through his hair was a thin scar shaped like a bolt of lightningof all the unusual things about harry this scar was the most extraordinary of all it was not as the dursleys had pretended for ten years a souvenir of the car crash that had killed harrys parentsbecause lily and james potter had not died in a car crash they had been murdered murdered by the most feared dark wizard for a hundred yearslord voldemort harry had escaped from the same attack with nothing more than a scar on his forehead where voldemorts curse instead of killing him had rebounded upon its originator barely alive voldemort had fledbut harry had come face to face with him at hogwarts remembering their last meeting as he stood at the dark window harry had to admit he was lucky even to have reached his thirteenth birthdayhe scanned the starry sky for a sign of hedwig perhaps soaring back to him with a dead mouse dangling from her beak expecting praisegazing absently over the rooftops it was a few seconds before harry realized what he was seeingsilhouetted against the golden moon and growing larger every momentwas a large strangely lopsided creature and it was flapping in harrys direction he stood quite still watching it sink lower and lower for a split second he hesitated his hand on the window latch wondering whether to slam it shut but then the bizarre creature soared over one of the street lamps of privet drive and harry realizing what it wasleapt asidethrough the window soared three owls two of them holding up the thirdwhich appeared to be unconscious they landed with a soft flump on harrys bed and the middle owl which was large and gray keeled right over and lay motionless there was a large package tied to its legsharry recognized the unconscious owl at once his name was errol and he belonged to the weasley family harry dashed to the bed untied thecords around errols legs took off the parcel and then carried errol to hedwigs cage errol opened one bleary eye gave a feeble hoot of thanks and began to gulp some waterharry turned back to the remaining owls one of them the large snowy female was his own hedwig she too was carrying a parcel and looked extremely pleased with herself she gave harry an affectionate nip with her beak as he removed her burden then flew across the room to join errolharry didnt recognize the third owl a handsome tawny one but he knew at once where it had come from because in addition to a third packageit was carrying a letter bearing the hogwarts crest when harry relieved this owl of its burden it ruffled its feathers importantly stretched its wings and took off through the window into the nightharry sat down on his bed and grabbed errols package ripped off the brown paper and discovered a present wrapped in gold and his first ever birthday card fingers trembling slightly he opened the envelopetwo pieces of paper fell out a letter and a newspaper clippingthe clipping had clearly come out of the wizarding newspaper the daily prophet because the people in the black and white picture were movingharry picked up the clipping smoothed it out and readministry of magic employee scoops grand prize arthur weasley head of the misuse of muggle artifacts office at the ministry of magic has won the annual daily prophet grand prize galleon drawa delighted mr weasley told the daily prophet we will be spending the gold on a summer holiday in egypt where our eldest son bill works as a curse breaker for gringotts wizarding bankthe weasley family will be spending a month in egypt returning for the start of the new school year at hogwarts which five of the weasley children currently attendharry scanned the moving photograph and a grin spread across his face as he saw all nine of the weasleys waving furiously at him standing in front of a large pyramid plump little mrs weasley tail balding mrweasley six sons and one daughter all though the black and white picture didnt show it with flaming red hair right in the middle of the picture was ron tall and gangling with his pet rat scabbers on his shoulder and his arm around his little sister ginnyharry couldnt think of anyone who deserved to win a large pile of gold more than the weasleys who were very nice and extremely poor he picked up rons letter and unfolded itdear harryhappy birthdaylook i really sorry about that telephone call i hope the muggles didnt give you a hard time i asked dad and he reckons i shouldnt have shoutedits amazing here in egypt bills taken us around all the tombs and you wouldnt believe the curses those old egyptian wizards put on them mum wouldnt let ginny come in the last one there were all these mutant skeletons in there of muggles whod broken in and grown extra heads and stuffi couldnt believe it when dad won the daily prophet draw seven hundred galleons most of its gone on this trip but theyre going to buy me a new wand for next yearharry remembered only too well the occasion when rons old wand had snapped it had happened when the car the two of them had been flying to hogwarts had crashed into a tree on the school groundswell be back about a week before term starts and well be going up to london to get my wand and our new books any chance of meeting you theredont let the muggles get you downtry and come to londonron ps percys head boy he got the letter last weekharry glanced back at the photograph percy who was in his seventh and final year at hogwarts was looking particularly smug he had pinned his head boy badge to the fez perched jauntily on top of his neat hair his horn rimmed glasses flashing in the egyptian sunharry now turned to his present and unwrapped it inside was what looked like a miniature glass spinning top there was another note from ron beneath itharry this is a pocket sneakoscope if theres someone untrustworthy around its supposed to light up and spin bill says its rubbish sold for wizard tourists and isnt reliable because it kept lighting up at dinner last night but he didnt realize fred and george had put beetles in his soupbye ron harry put the pocket sneakoscope on his bedside table where it stood quite still balanced on its point reflecting the luminous hands of his clock he looked at it happily for a few seconds then picked up the parcel hedwig had broughtinside this too there was a wrapped present a card and a letterthis time from hermionedear harryron wrote to me and told me about his phone call to your uncle vernon i do hope youre all rightim on holiday in france at the moment and i didnt know

holidayscan you make it will your aunt and uncle let you come i really hope you can if not ill see you on the hogwarts express on september firstlove from hermione ps ron says percys head boy ill bet percys really pleased ron doesnt seem too happy about it harry laughed as he put herrmones letter aside and picked up her present it was very heavy knowing hermione he was sure it would be a large book full of very difficult spells but it wasnt his heart gave a huge bound as he ripped back the paper and saw a sleek black leather case with silver words stamped across it reading broomstick servicing kitwow hermione harry whispered unzipping the case to look insidethere was a large jar of fleetwoods high finish handle polish a pair of gleaming silver tall twig clippers a tiny brass compass to clip on your broom for long journeys and a handbook of do it yourself broomcareapart from his friends the thing that harry missed most about hogwarts was quidditch the most popular sport in the magical world highly dangerous very exciting and played on broomsticks harry happened to be a very good quidditch player he had been the youngest person in a century to be picked for one of the hogwarts house teams one of harrys most prized possessions was his nimbus two thousand racing broomharry put the leather case aside and picked up his last parcel he recognized the untidy scrawl on the brown paper at once this was from hagrid the hogwarts gamekeeper he tore off the top layer of paper and glimpsed something green and leathery but before he could unwrap it properly the parcel gave a strange quiver and whatever was inside it snapped loudly as though it had jawsharry froze he knew that hagrid would never send him anything dangerous on purpose but then hagrid didnt have a normal persons view of what was dangerous hagrid had been known to befriend giant spiders buy vicious three headed dogs from men in pubs and sneak illegal dragon eggs into his cabinharry poked the parcel nervously it snapped loudly again harry reached for the lamp on his bedside table gripped it firmly in one hand and raised it over his head ready to strike then he seized the rest of the wrapping paper in his other hand and pulledand out fell a book harry just had time to register its handsome green cover emblazoned with the golden title the monster book of monsters before it flipped onto its edge and scuttled sideways along the bed like some weird crabuh oh harry mutteredthe book toppled off the bed with a loud clunk and shuffled rapidly across the room harry followed it stealthily the book was hiding in the dark space under his desk praying that the dursleys were still fast asleep harry got down on his hands and knees and reached toward itouchthe book snapped shut on his hand and then flapped past him still scuttling on its covers harry scrambled around threw himself forwardand managed to flatten it uncle vernon gave a loud sleepy grunt in the room next doorhedwig and errol watched interestedly as harry clamped the struggling book tightly in his arms hurried to his chest of drawers and pulled out a belt which he buckled tightly around it the monster book shuddered angrily but could no longer flap and snap so harry threw it down on the bed and reached for hagrids carddear harryhappy birthdaythink you might find this useful for next year wont say no more heretell you when i see you hope the muggles are treating you rightall the besthagridit struck harry as ominous that hagrid thought a biting book would come in useful but he put hagrids card up next to rons and hermiones grinning more broadly than ever now there was only the letter from hogwarts leftnoticing that it was rather thicker than usual harry slit open the envelope pulled out the first page of parchment within and readdear mr potterplease note that the new school year will begin on september the firstthe hogwarts express will leave ftom kings cross station platform nine and three quarters at eleven oclockthird years are permitted to visit the village of hogsmeade on certain weekends please give the enclosed permission form to your parent or guardian to signa list of books for next year is enclosed yours sincerelyprofessor m mcgonagall deputy headmistressharry pulled out the hogsmeade permission form and looked at it no longer grinning it would be wonderful to visit hogsmeade on weekends he knew it was an entirely wizarding village and he had never set foot there but how on earth was he going to persuade uncle vernon or aunt petunia to sign the formhe looked over at the alarm clock it was now two oclock in the morningdeciding that hed worry about the hogsmeade form when he woke up harry got back into bed and reached up to cross off another day on the chart hed made for himself counting down the days left until his return to hogwarts then he took off his glasses and lay down eyes open facing his three birthday cardsextremely unusual though he was at that moment harry potter felt just like everyone else glad for the first time in his life that it was his birthdaychapter two aunt marges big mistakeharry went down to breakfast the next morning to find the three dursleys already sitting around the kitchen table they were watching a brand new television a welcome home for the summer present for dudley who had been complaining loudly about the long walk between the fridge and the television in the living room dudley had spent most of the summer in the kitchen his piggy little eyes fixed on the screen and his five chins wobbling as he ate continuallyharry sat down between dudley and uncle vernon a large beefy man with very little neck and a lot of mustache far from wishing harry a happy birthday none of the dursleys made any sign that they had noticed harry enter the room but harry was far too used to this to care he helped himself to a piece of toast and then looked up at the reporter on the television who was halfway through a report on an escaped convictthe public is warned that black is armed and extremely dangerous a special hot line has been set up and any sighting of black should be reported immediatelyno need to tell us hes no good snorted uncle vernon staring over the top of his newspaper at the prisoner look at the state of him the filthy layabout look at his hairhe shot a nasty look sideways at harry whose untidy hair had always been a source of great annoyance to uncle vernon compared to the man on the television however whose gaunt face was surrounded by a matted elbow length tangle harry felt very well groomed indeedthe reporter had reappearedthe ministry of agriculture and fisheries will announce today hang on barked uncle vernon staring furiously at the reporter you didnt tell us where that maniacs escaped from \what use is thatlunatic could be coming up the street right nowaunt petunia who was bony and horse faced whipped around and peered intently out of the kitchen window harry knew aunt petunia would simply love to be the one to call the hot line number she was the nosiest woman in the world and spent most of her life spying on the boring law abiding neighborswhen will they learn said uncle vernon pounding the table with his large purple fist that hangings the only way to deal with these peoplevery true said aunt petunia who was still squinting into next doors runner beansuncle vernon drained his teacup glanced at his watch and added id better be off in a minute petunia marges train gets in at tenharry whose thoughts had been upstairs with the broomstick servicing kit was brought back to earth with an unpleasant bumpaunt marge he blurted out sh shes not coming here is sheaunt marge was uncle vernons sister even though she was not a blood relative of harrys whose mother had been aunt petunias sister he had been forced to call her aunt all his life aunt marge lived in the country in a house with a large garden where she bred bulldogs she didnt often stay at privet drive because she couldnt bear to leave her precious dogs but each of her visits stood out horribly vividly in harrys mindat dudleys fifth birthday party aunt margo had whacked harry around the shins with her walking stick to stop him from beating dudley at musical statues a few years later she had turned up at christmas with a computerized robot for dudley and a box of dog biscuits for harry on her last visit the year before harry started at hogwarts harry had accidentally trodden on the tail of her favorite dog ripper had chased harry out into the garden and up a tree and aunt marge had refused to call him off until past midnight the memory of this incident still brought tears of laughter to dudleys eyesmargell be here for a week uncle vernon snarled and while were on the subject he pointed a fat finger threateningly at harry we need to get a few things straight before i go and collect herdudley smirked and withdrew his gaze from the television watching harry being bullied by uncle vernon was dudleys favorite form of entertainmentfirstly growled uncle vernon youll keep a civil tongue in your head when youre talking to margeall right said harry bitterly if she does when shes talking to mesecondly said uncle vernon acting as though he had not heard harrys reply as marge doesnt know anything about your abnormality i dont want any any funny stuff while shes hereyou behave yourself got mei will if she does said harry through gritted teethand thirdly said uncle vernon his mean little eyes now slits in his great purple face weve told marge you attend st brutuss secure center for incurably criminal boyswhat harry yelledand youll be sticking to that story boy or therell be trouble spat uncle vernonharry sat there white faced and furious staring at uncle vernonhardly able to believe it aunt marge coming for a weeklong visit it was the worst birthday present the dursleys had ever given him including that pair of uncle vernons old sockswell petunia said uncle vernon getting heavily to his feet ill be off to the station then want to come along for the ride duddersno said dudley whose attention had returned to the television now that uncle vernon had finished threatening harryduddys got to make himself smart for his auntie said aunt petunia smoothing dudleys thick blond hair mummys bought him a lovely new bow tieuncle vernon clapped dudley on his porky shoulder see you in a bit then he said and he left the kitchenharry who had been sitting in a kind of horrified trance had a sudden idea abandoning his toast he got quickly to his feet and followed uncle vernon to the front dooruncle vernon was pulling on his car coatim not taking you he snarled as he turned to see harry watching himlike i wanted to come said harry coldly i want to ask you somethinguncle vernon eyed him suspiciouslythird years at hog at my school are allowed to visit the village sometimes said harryso snapped uncle vernon taking his car keys from a hook

aunt marge i go to that st whatsits st brutuss secure center for incurably criminal boys bellowed uncle vernon and harry was pleased to hear a definite note of panic in uncle vernons voiceexactly said harry looking calmly up into uncle vernons large purple face its a lot to remember ill have to make it sound convincing wont i what if i accidentally let something slipyoull get the stuffing knocked out of you wont you roared uncle vernon advancing on harry with his fist raised but harry stood his groundknocking the stuffing out of me wont make aunt marge forget what i could tell her he said grimlyuncle vernon stopped his fist still raised his face an ugly pucebut if you sign my permission form harry went on quickly i swear ill remember where im supposed to go to school and ill act like a mug like im normal and everythingharry could tell that uncle vernon was thinking it over even if his teeth were bared and a vein was throbbing in his templeright he snapped finally i shall monitor your behavior carefully during marges visit if at the end of it youve toed the line and kept to the story ill sign your ruddy formhe wheeled around pulled open the front door and slammed it so hard that one of the little panes of glass at the top fell outharry didnt return to the kitchen he went back upstairs to his bedroom if he was going to act like a real muggle hed better start now slowly and sadly he gathered up all his presents and his birthday cards and hid them under the loose floorboard with his homework then he went to hedwigs cage errol seemed to have recovered he and hedwig were both asleep heads under their wings harry sighed then poked them both awakehedwig he said gloomily youre going to have to clear off for a week go with errol ronll look after you ill write him a note explaining and dont look at me like that hedwigs large amber eyes were reproachful its not my fault its the only way ill be allowed to visit hogsmeade with ron and hermioneten minutes later errol and hedwig who had a note to ron bound to her leg soared out of the window and out of sight harry now feeling thoroughly miserable put the empty cage away inside the wardrobebut harry didnt have long to brood in next to no time aunt petunia was shrieking up the stairs for harry to come down and get ready to welcome their guestdo something about your hair aunt petunia snapped as he reached the hallharry couldnt see the point of trying to make his hair lie flat aunt marge loved criticizing him so the untidier he looked the happier she would beall too soon there was a crunch of gravel outside as uncle vernons car pulled back into the driveway then the clunk of the car doors and footsteps on the garden pathget the door aunt petunia hissed at harrya feeling of great gloom in his stomach harry pulled the door openon the threshold stood aunt marge she was very like uncle vernonlarge beefy and purple faced she even had a mustache though not as bushy as his in one hand she held an enormous suitcase and tucked under the other was an old and evil tempered bulldogwheres my dudders roared aunt marge wheres my neffy poodudley came waddling down the hall his blond hair plastered flat to his fat head a bow tie just visible under his many chins aunt marge thrust the suitcase into harrys stomach knocking the wind out of him seized dudley in a tight one armed hug and planted a large kiss on his cheekharry knew perfectly well that dudley only put up with aunt marges hugs because he was well paid for it and sure enough when they broke apartdudley had a crisp twenty pound note clutched in his fat fistpetunia shouted aunt marge striding past harry as though he was a hat stand aunt marge and aunt petunia kissed or rather aunt marge bumped her large jaw against aunt petunias bony cheekboneuncle vernon now came in smiling jovially as he shut the doortea marge he said and what will ripper takeripper can have some tea out of my saucer said aunt marge as they all proceeded into the kitchen leaving harry alone in the hall with the suitcase but harry wasnt complaining any excuse not to be with aunt marge was fine by him so he began to heave the case upstairs into the spare bedroom taking as long as he couldby the time he got back to the kitchen aunt marge had been supplied with tea and fruitcake and ripper was lapping noisily in the cornerharry saw aunt petunia

have done it myself youd have gone straight to an orphanage if youd been dumped on my doorstepharry was bursting to say that hed rather live in an orphanage than with the dursleys but the thought of the hogsmeade form stopped him he forced his face into a painful smiledont you smirk at me boomed aunt marge i can see you havent improved since i last saw you i hoped school would knock some manners into you she took a large gulp of tea wiped her mustache and saidwhere is it that you send him again vernonst brutuss said uncle vernon promptly its a first rate institution for hopeless casesi see

properly he added all the timeexcellent said aunt marge i wont have this namby pambywishy washy nonsense about not hitting people who deserve it a good thrashing is whats needed in ninety nine cases out of a hundred have you been beaten oftenoh yeah said harry loads of timesaunt marge narrowed her eyesi still dont like your tone boy she said if you can speak of your beatings in that casual way they clearly arent hitting you hard enough petunia id write if i were you make it clear that you approve the use of extreme force in this boys caseperhaps uncle vernon was worried that harry might forget their bargain in any case he changed the subject abruptlyheard the news this morning marge what about that escaped prisoner ehas aunt marge started to make herself at home harry caught himself thinking almost longingly of life at number four without her uncle vernon and aunt petunia usually encouraged harry to stay out of their way which harry was only too happy to do aunt marge on the other hand wanted harry under her eye at all times so that she could boom out suggestions for his improvement she delighted in comparing harry with dudley and took huge pleasure in buying dudley expensive presents while glaring at harry as though daring him to ask why he hadnt got a present too she also kept throwing out dark hints about what made harry such an unsatisfactory personyou mustnt blame yourself for the way the boys turned out vernon she said over lunch on the third day if theres something rotten on the inside theres nothing anyone can do about itharry tried to concentrate on his food but his hands shook and his face was starting to burn with anger remember the form he told himself think about hogsmeade dont say anything dont rise aunt marge reached for her glass of wineits one of the basic rules of breeding she said you see it all the time with dogs if theres something wrong with the bitch therell be something wrong with the pup at that moment the wineglass aunt marge was holding exploded in her hand shards of glass flew in every direction and aunt marge sputtered and blinked her great ruddy face drippingmarge squealed aunt petunia marge are you all rightnot to worry grunted aunt marge mopping her face with her napkinmust have squeezed it too hard did the same thing at colonel fubsters the other day no need to fuss petunia i have a very firm gripbut aunt petunia and uncle vernon were both looking at harry suspiciously so he decided hed better skip dessert and escape from the table as soon as he couldoutside in the hall he leaned against the wall breathing deeply it had been a long time since hed lost control and made something explode he couldnt afford to let it happen again the hogsmeade form wasnt the only thing at stake if he carried on like that hed be in trouble with the ministry of magicharry was still an underage wizard and he was forbidden by wizard law to do magic outside school his record wasnt exactly clean either only last summer hed gotten an official warning that had stated quite clearly that if the ministry got wind of any more magic in privet driveharry would face expulsion from hogwartshe heard the dursleys leaving the table and hurried upstairs out of the wayharry got through the next three days by forcing himself to think about his handbook of do it yourself broomcare whenever aunt marge started on him this worked quite well though it seemed to give him a glazed lookbecause aunt marge started voicing the opinion that he was mentally subnormalat last at long last the final evening of marges stay arrived aunt petunia cooked a fancy dinner and uncle vernon uncorked several bottles of wine they got all the way through the soup and the salmon without a single mention of harrys faults during the lemon meringue pie unclevernon bored them a with a long talk about grunnings his drill making company then aunt petunia made coffee and uncle vernon brought out a bottle of brandycan i tempt you margeaunt marge had already had quite a lot of wine her huge face was very redjust a small one then she chuckled a bit more than that and a bit more thats the ticketdudley was eating his fourth slice of pie aunt petunia was sipping coffee with her little finger sticking out harry really wanted to disappear into his bedroom but he met uncle vernons angry little eyes and knew he would have to sit it outaah said aunt marge smacking her lips and putting the empty brandy glass back down excellent nosh petunia its normally just a fry up for me of an evening with twelve dogs to look after she burped richly and patted her great tweed stomach pardon me but i do like to see a healthy sized boy she went on winking at dudley youll be a proper sized man dudders like your father yes ill have a spot more brandy vernonnow this one here she jerked her head at harry who felt his stomach clench the handbook he thought quicklythis ones got a mean runty look about him you get that with dogs i had colonel fubster drown one last year ratty little thing it was weak underbredharry was trying to remember page twelve of his book a charm to cure reluctant reversers it all comes down to blood as i was saying the other daybad blood will out now im saying nothing against your familypetunia she patted aunt petunias bony hand with her shovellike one but your sister was a bad egg they turn up in the best families then she ran off with a wastrel and heres the result right in front of usharry was staring at his plate a funny ringing in his ears grasp your broom firmly by the tail he thought but he couldnt remember what came next aunt marges voice seemed to be boring into him like one of uncle vernons drillsthis potter said aunt marge loudly seizing the brandy bottle and splashing more into her glass and over the tablecloth you never told me what he diduncle vernon and aunt petunia were looking extremely tense dudley had even looked up from his pie to gape at his parentshe didnt work said uncle vernon with half a glance at harryunemployedas i expected said aunt marge taking a huge swig of brandy and wiping her chin on her sleeve a no account good for nothing lazy scrounger who he was not said harry suddenly the table went very quiet harry was shaking all over he had never felt so angry in his lifemore brandy yelled uncle vernon who had gone very white he emptied the bottle into aunt marges glass you boy he snarled at harry go to bed go on no vernon hiccuped aunt marge holding up a hand her tiny bloodshot eyes fixed on harrys go on boy go on proud of your parents are you they go and get themselves killed in a car crash drunk i expect they didnt die in a car crash said harry who found himself on his feetthey died in a car crash you nasty little liar and left you to be a burden on their decent hardworking relatives screamed aunt marge swelling with fury you are an insolent ungrateful little but aunt marge suddenly stopped speaking for a moment it looked as though words had failed her she seemed to be swelling with inexpressible anger but the swelling didnt stop her great red face started to expand her tiny eyes bulged and her mouth stretched too tightly for speech next second several buttons had just burst from her tweed jacket and pinged off the walls she was inflating like a monstrous balloon her stomach bursting free of her tweed waistband each of her fingers blowing up like a salami marge yelled uncle vernon and aunt petunia together as aunt marges whole body began to rise off her chair toward the ceiling she was entirely round now like a vast life buoy with piggy eyes and her hands and feet stuck out weirdly as she drifted up into the air making apoplectic popping noises ripper came skidding into the room barking madlynooooooouncle vernon seized one of marges feet and tried to pull her down again but was almost lifted from the floor himself a second laterripper leapt forward and sank his teeth into uncle vernons legharry tore from the dining room before anyone could stop him heading for the cupboard under the stairs the cupboard door burst magically open as he reached it in seconds he had heaved his trunk to the front door he sprinted upstairs and threw himself under the bed wrenching up the loose floorboard and grabbed the pillowcase full of his books and birthday presents he wriggled out seized hedwigs empty cage and dashed back downstairs to his trunk just as uncle vernon burst out of the dining room his trouser leg in bloody tatterscome back in here he bellowed come back and put her rightbut a reckless rage had come over harry he kicked his trunk openpulled out his wand and pointed it at uncle vernonshe deserved it harry said breathing very fast she deserved what she got you keep away from mehe fumbled behind him for the latch on the doorim going harry said ive had enoughand in the next moment he was out in the dark quiet street heaving his heavy trunk behind him hedwigs cage under his armchapter three the knight busharry was several streets away before he collapsed onto a low wall in magnolia crescent panting from the effort of dragging his trunk he sat quite still anger still surging through him listening to the frantic thumping of his heartbut after ten minutes alone in the dark street a new emotion overtook him panic whichever way he looked at it he had never been in a worse fix he was stranded quite alone in the dark muggle world with absolutely nowhere to go and the worst of it was he had just done serious magic which meant that he was almost certainly expelled from hogwarts he had broken the decree for the restriction of underage wizardry so badly he was surprised ministry of magic representatives werent swooping down on him where he satharry shivered and looked up and down magnolia crescentwhat was going to happen to him would he be arrested or would he simply be outlawed from the wizarding world he thought of ron and hermione and his heart sank even lower harry was sure that criminal or not ron and hermione would want to help him now but they were both abroad and with hedwig gone he had no means of contacting themhe didnt have any muggle money either there was a little wizard gold in the money bag at the bottom of his trunk but the rest of the fortune his parents had left him was stored in a vault at gringotts wizarding bank in london hed never be able to drag his trunk all the way to london unlesshe looked down at his wand which he was still clutching in his hand if he was already expelled his heart was now thumping painfully fast a bit more magic couldnt hurt he had the invisibility cloak he had inherited from his father what if he bewitched the trunk to make it feather light tied it to his broomstick covered himself in the cloak and flew to london then he could get the rest of his money out of his vault and begin his life as an outcast it was a horrible prospect but he couldnt sit on this wall forever or hed find himself trying to explain to muggle police why he was out in the dead of night with a trunkful of spellbooks and a broomstickharry opened his trunk again and pushed the contents aside looking for the invisibility cloak but before he had found it he straightened up suddenly looking around him once morea funny prickling on the back of his neck had made harry feel he was being watched but the street appeared to be deserted and no lights shone from any of the large square houseshe bent over his trunk again but almost immediately stood up once more his hand clenched on his wand he had sensed rather than heard it someone or something was standing in the narrow gap between the garage and the fence behind him harry squinted at the black alleyway if only it would move then hed know whether it was just a stray cat or something elselumos harry muttered and a light appeared at the end of his wand almost dazzling him he held it high over his head and the pebble dashed walls of number two suddenly sparkled the garage door gleamed and between them harry saw quite distinctly the hulking outline of something very big with wide gleaming eyesharry stepped backward his legs hit his trunk and he tripped his wand flew out of his hand as he flung out an arm to break his fall and he landed hard in the gutter there was a deafening bang and harry threw up his hands to shield his eyes against a sudden blinding light with a yell he rolled back onto the pavement just in time a second later a gigantic pair of wheels and headlights screeched to a halt exactly where harry had just been lying they belonged as harry saw when he raised his head to a triple decker violently purple bus which had appeared out of thin air gold lettering over the windshield spelled the knight busfor a split second harry wondered if he had been knocked silly by his fall then a conductor in a purple uniform leapt out of the bus and began to speak loudly to the nightwelcome to the knight bus emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard just stick out your wand hand step on board and we can take you anywhere you want to go my name is stan shunpike and i will be your conductor this eve the conductor stopped abruptly he had just caught sight of harry who was still sitting on the ground harry snatched up his wand again and scrambled to his feet close up he saw that stan shunpike was only a few years older than he was eighteen or nineteen at most with large protruding ears and quite a few pimpleswhat were you doin down there said stan dropping his professional mannerfell over said harrychoo fall over for sniggered stani didnt do it on purpose said harry annoyed one of the knees in his jeans was torn and the hand he had thrown out to break his fall was bleeding he suddenly remembered why he had fallen over and turned around quickly to stare at the alleyway between the garage and fencethe knight buss headlamps were flooding it with light and it was emptychoo lookin at said stanthere was a big black thing said harry pointing uncertainly into the gap like a dog but massivehe looked a round at stan whose mouth was slightly open with a feeling of unease harry saw stans eyes move to the scar on harrys foreheadwoss that on your ead said stan abruptlynothing said harry quickly flattening his hair over his scar if the ministry of magic was looking for him he didnt want to make it too easy for themwoss your name stan persistedneville longbottom said harry saying the first name that came into his head so so this bus he went on quickly hoping to distract stan did you say it goes anywhereyep said stan proudly anywhere you like longs its on land cant do nuffink underwater ere he said looking suspicious again you did flag us down dincha stuck out your wand and dinchayes said harry quickly listen how much would it be to get to londoneleven sickles said stan but for fifteen you get or chocolate and for fifteen you get an ot water bottle an a toofbrush in the color of your choiceharry rummaged once more in his trunk extracted his money bag and shoved some gold into stans hand he and stan then lifted his trunk with hedwigs cage balanced on top up the steps of the busthere were no seats instead half a dozen brass bedsteads stood beside the curtained windows candles were burning in brackets beside each bed illuminating the wood paneled walls a tiny wizard in a nightcap at the rear of the bus muttered not now thanks im pickling some slugs and rolled over in his sleepyou ave this one stan whispered shoving harrys trunk under the bed right behind the driver who was sitting in an armchair in front of the steering wheel this is our driver ernie prang this is neville longbottom ern ernie prang an elderly wizard wearing very thick glasses nodded to harry who nervously flattened his bangs again and sat down on his bedtake er away ern said stan sitting down in the armchair next to erniesthere was another tremendous bang and the next moment harry found himself flat on his bed thrown backward by the speed of the knight buspulling himself up harry stared out of the dark window and saw that they were now bowling along a completely different street stan was watching harrys stunned face with great enjoymentthis is where we was before you flagged us down he said where are we ern somewhere in walesar said erniehow come the muggles dont hear the bus said harrythem said stan contemptuously don listen properly do they don look properly either never notice nuffink they donbest go wake up madam marsh stan said ern well be in abergavenny in a minutestan passed harrys bed and disappeared up a narrow wooden staircaseharry was still looking out of the window feeling increasingly nervousernie didnt seem to have mastered the use of a steering wheel the knight bus kept mounting the pavement but it didnt hit anything lines of lampposts mailboxes and trash cans jumped out of its way as it approached and back into position once it had passedstan came back downstairs followed by a faintly green witch wrapped in a traveling cloakere you go madam marsh said stan happily as ern stamped on the brake and the beds slid a foot or so toward the front of the bus madam marsh clamped a handkerchief to her mouth and tottered down the stepsstan threw her bag out after her and rammed the doors shut there was another loud bang and they were thundering down a narrow country lane trees leaping out of the wayharry wouldnt have been able to sleep even if he had been traveling on a bus that didnt keep banging loudly and jumping a hundred miles at a time his stomach churned as he fell back to wondering what was going to happen to him and whether the dursleys had managed to get aunt marge off the ceiling yetstan had unfurled a copy of the daily prophet and was now reading with his tongue between his teeth a large photograph of a sunken faced man with long matted hair blinked slowly at harry from the front page he looked strangely familiarthat man harry said forgetting his troubles for a moment he was on the muggle newsstanley turned to the front page and chuckledsirius black he said nodding course e was on the muggle newsneville where you beenhe gave a superior sort of chuckle at the blank look on harrys face removed the front page and handed it to harryyou oughta read the papers more nevilleharry held the paper up to the candlelight and readblack still at large

use to kill each other the magical community lives in fear of a massacre like that of twelve years ago when black murdered thirteen people with a single curseharry looked into the shadowed eyes of sirius black the only part of the sunken face that seemed alive harry had never met a vampire but he had seen pictures of them in his defense against the dark arts classes and black with his waxy white skin looked just like onescary lookin fing inee said stan who had been watching harry readhe murdered thirteen people said harry handing the page back to stan with one curseyep said stan in

few nights timeear about that arry potter blew up is aunt we ad im ere on the knight bus dint we ern e was tryin i to run for ithe harry had broken wizard law just like sirius black was inflating aunt marge bad enough to land him in azkaban harry didnt know anything about the wizard prison though everyone hed ever heard speak of it did so in the same fearful tone hagrid the hogwarts gamekeeper had spent two months there only last year harry wouldnt soon forget the look of terror on hagrids face when he had been told where he was going and hagrid was one of the bravest people harry knewthe knight bus rolled through the darkness scattering bushes and wastebaskets telephone booths and trees and harry lay restless and miserable on his feather bed after a while stan remembered that harry had paid for hot chocolate but poured it all over harrys pillow when the bus moved abruptly from anglesea to aberdeen one by one wizards and witches in dressing gowns and slippers descended from the upper floors to leave the bus they all looked very pleased to gofinally harry was the only passenger leftright then neville said stan clapping his hands where abouts in londondiagon alley said harryrighto said stan old tight thenbangthey were thundering along charing cross road harry sat up and watched buildings and benches squeezing themselves out of the knight buss waythe sky was getting a little lighter he would lie low for a couple of hours go to gringotts the moment it opened then set off where he didnt knowern slammed on the brakes and the knight bus skidded to a halt in front of a small and shabby looking pub the leaky cauldron behind which lay the magical entrance to diagon alleythanks harry said to ernhe jumped down the steps and helped stan lower his trunk and hedwigs cage onto the pavementwell said harry bye thenbut stan wasnt paying attention still standing in the doorway to the bus he was goggling at the shadowy entrance to the leaky cauldronthere you are harry said a voicebefore harry could turn he felt a hand on his shoulder at the same time stan shouted blimey ern come ere come ere iharry looked up at the owner of the hand on his shoulder and felt a bucketful of ice cascade into his stomach he had walked right into cornelius fudge the minister of magic himselfstan leapt onto the pavement beside themwhat didja call neville minister he said excitedlyfudge a portly little man in a long pinstriped cloak looked cold and exhaustedneville he repeated frowning this is harry potteri knew it stan shouted gleefully ern ern guess oo neville isern es arry potter i can see is scaryes said fudge testily well im very glad the knight bus picked harry up but he and i need to step inside the leaky cauldron nowfudge increased the pressure on harrys shoulder and harry found himself being steered inside the pub a stooping figure bearing a lantern appeared through the door behind the bar it was tom the wizened toothless landlordyouve got him minister said tom will you be wanting anythingbeer brandyperhaps a pot of tea said fudge who still hadnt let go of harrythere was a loud scraping and puffing from behind them and stan and ern appeared carrying harrys trunk and hedwigs cage and looking around excitedlyow come you dint tell us oo you are eh neville said stan beaming at harry while ernies owlish face peered interestedly over stans shoulderand a private parlor please tom said fudge pointedlybye harry said miserably to stan and ern as tom beckoned fudge toward the passage that led from the barbye neville called stanfudge marched harry along the narrow passage after toms lantern and then into a small parlor tom clicked his fingers a fire burst into life in the grate and he bowed himself out of the roomsit down harry said fudge indicating a chair by the fireharry sat down feeling goose bumps rising up his arms despite the glow of the fire fudge took off his pinstriped cloak and tossed it aside then hitched up the trousers of his bottle green suit and sat down opposite harryi am cornelius fudge harry the minister of magicharry already knew this of course he had seen fudge once before but as he had been wearing his fathers invisibility cloak at the timefudge wasnt to know thattom the innkeeper reappeared wearing an apron over his nightshirt and bearing a tray of tea and crumpets he placed the tray on a table between fudge and harry and left the parlor closing the door behind himwell harry said fudge pouring out tea youve had us all in a right flap i dont mind telling you running away from your aunt and uncles house like that id started to think but youre safe and thats what mattersfudge buttered himself a crumpet and pushed the plate toward harryeat harry you look dead on your feet now then you will be pleased to hear that we have dealt with the unfortunate blowing up of miss marjorie dursley two members of the accidental magic reversal department were dispatched to privet drive a few hours ago miss dursley has been punctured and her memory has been modified she has no recollection of the incident at all so thats that and no harm donefudge smiled at harry over the rim of his teacup rather like an uncle surveying a favorite nephew harry who couldnt believe his ears opened his mouth to speak couldnt think of anything to say and closed it againah youre worrying about the reaction of your aunt and uncle said fudge well i wont deny that they are extremely angry harry but they are prepared to take you back next summer as long as you stay at hogwarts for the christmas and easter holidaysharry unstuck his throati always stay at hogwarts for the christmas and easter holidays he said and i dont ever want to go back to privet drivenow now im sure youll feel differently once youve calmed down said fudge in a worried tone they are your family after all and im sure you are fond of each other er very deep downit didnt occur to harry to put fudge right he was still waiting to hear what was going to happen to him nowso all that remains said fudge now buttering himself a second crumpet is to decide where youre going to spend the last two weeks of your vacation i suggest you take a room here at the leaky cauldron and hang on blurted harry what about my punishmentfudge blinked punishmenti broke the law harry said the decree for the restriction of underage wizardryoh my dear boy were not going to punish you for a little thing like that cried fudge waving his crumpet impatiently it was an accidentwe dont send people to azkaban just for blowing up their auntsbut this didnt tally at all with harrys past dealings with the ministry of magiclast year i got an official warning just because a house elf smashed a pudding in my uncles house he told fudge frowning the ministry of magic said id be expelled from hogwarts if there was any more magic thereunless harrys eyes were deceiving him fudge was suddenly looking awkwardcircumstances change harry we have to take into account in the present climate surely you dont want to be expelledof course i dont said harrywell then whats a the fuss about laughed fudge now have a crumpet harry while i go and see if toms got a room for youfudge strode out of the parlor and harry stared after him there was something extremely odd going on why had fudge been waiting for him at the leaky cauldron if not to punish him for what hed done and now harry came to think of it surely it wasnt usual for the minister of magic himself to get involved in matters of underage magicfudge came back accompanied by tom the innkeeperroom elevens free harry said fudge i think youll be very comfortable just one thing and im sure youll understand i dont want you wandering off into muggle london all right keep to diagon alley and youre to be back here before dark each night sure youll understand tom will be keeping an eye on you for meokay said harry slowly but whydont want to lose you again do we said fudge with a hearty laughno no best we know where you are i meanfudge cleared his throat loudly and picked up his pinstriped cloakwell ill be off plenty to do you knowhave you had any luck with black yet harry askedfudges finger slipped on the silver fastenings of his cloakwhats that oh youve heard well no not yet but its only a matter of time the azkaban guards have never yet failed and they are angrier than ive ever seen themfudge shuddered slightlyso ill say good byehe held out his hand and harry shaking it had a sudden ideaer minister can i ask you somethingcertainly said fudge with a smilewell third years at hogwarts are allowed to visit hogsmeade but my aunt and uncle didnt sign the permission form dyou think you could fudge was looking uncomfortableah he said no no im very sorry harry but as im not your parent or guardian but you i re the minister of magic said harry eagerly if you gave me permissionno im sorry harry but rules are rules said fudge flatlyperhaps youll be able to visit hogsmeade next year in fact i think its best if you dont yes well ill be off enjoy your stayharryand with a last smile and shake of harrys hand fudge left the roomtom now moved forward beaming at harryif youll follow me mr potter he said ive already taken your things upharry followed tom up a handsome wooden staircase to a door with a brass number eleven on it which tom unlocked and opened for himinside was a very comfortable looking bed some highly polished oak furniture a cheerfully crackling fire and perched on top of the wardrobe hedwig harry gaspedthe snowy owl clicked her beak and fluttered down onto harrys armvery smart owl youve got there chuckled tom arrived about five minutes after you did if theres anything you need mr potter dont hesitate to askhe gave another bow and leftharry sat on his bed for a long time absentmindedly stroking hedwigthe sky outside the window was changing rapidly from deep velvety blue to cold steely gray and then slowly to pink shot with gold harry could hardly believe that hed left privet drive only a few hours agothat he wasnt expelled and that he was now facing two completely dursley free weeksits been a very weird night hedwig he yawnedand without even removing his glasses he slumped back onto his pillows and fell asleepchapter four the leaky cauldronit took harry several days to get used to his strange new freedom never before had he been able to get up whenever he wanted or eat whatever he fancied he could even go wherever he pleased as long as it was in diagon alley and as this long cobbled street was packed with the most fascinating wizarding shops in the world harry felt no desire to break his word to fudge and stray back into the muggle worldharry ate breakfast each morning in the leaky cauldron where he liked watching the other guests funny little witches from the country up for a days shopping venerable looking wizards arguing over the latest article in transfiguration today wild looking warlocks raucous dwarfs and once what looked suspiciously like a hag who ordered a plate of raw liver from behind a thick woollen balaclavaafter breakfast harry would go out into the backyard take out his wand tap the third brick from the left above the trash bit and stand back as the archway into diagon alley opened in the wallharry spent the long sunny days exploring the shops and eating under the brightly colored umbrellas outside cafes where his fellow diners were showing one another their purchases it s a lunascope old boy no more messing around with moon charts see or else discussing the case of sirius black personalty i wont let any of the children out alone until hes back in azkaban harry didnt have to do his homework under the blankets by flashlight anymore now he could sit in the bright sunshine outside florean fortescues ice cream parlor finishing all his essays with occasional help from florean fortescue himself who apart from knowing a great deal about medieval witch burnings gave harry free sundaes every half an houronce harry had refilled his money bag with gold galleons silver sickles and bronze knuts from his vault at gringotts he had to exercise a lot of self control not to spend the whole lot at once he had to keep reminding himself that he had five years to go at hogwarts and how it would feel to ask the dursleys for money for spellbooks to stop himself from buying a handsome set of solid gold gobstones a wizarding game rather like marbles in which the stones squirt a nasty smelling liquid into the other players face when they lose a point he was sorely tempted too by the perfect moving model of the galaxy in a large glass ball which would have meant he never had to take another astronomy lesson but the thing that tested harrys resolution most appeared in his favorite shop quality quidditch supplies a week after hed arrived at the leaky cauldroncurious to know what the crowd in the shop was staring at harry edged his way inside and squeezed in among the excited witches and wizards until he glimpsed a newly erected podium on which was mounted the most magnificent broom he had ever seen in his lifejust come out prototype a square jawed wizard was telling his companionits the fastest broom in the world isnt it dad squeaked a boy younger than harry who was swinging off his fathers armirish international sides just put in an order for seven of these beauties the proprietor of the shop told the crowd and theyre favorites for the world cupa large witch in front of harry moved and he was able to read the sign next to the broomthe firebolt this state of the art pacing broom sports a stream linedsuperfine handle of ash treated with a diamond hard polish and hand numbered with its own registration number each individually selected birch twig in the broomtail has been honed to aerodynamic perfection giving the firebolt unsurpassable balance and pinpoint precisionthe firebolt has an acceleration of miles an hour in ten seconds and incorporates an unbreakable braking charm price on requestprice on request harry didnt like to think how much gold the firebolt would cost he had never wanted anything as much in his whole life but he had never lost a quidditch match on his nim bus two thousand and what was the point in emptying his gringotts vault for the firebolt when he had a very good broom already harry didnt ask for the price but he returned almost every day after that just to look at the fireboltthere were however things that harry needed to buy he went to the apothecary to replenish his store of potions ingredients and as his school robes were now several inches too short in the arm and leg he visited madam malkins robes for all occasions and bought new ones most important of all he had to buy his new schoolbooks which would include those for his two new subjects care of magical creatures and divinationharry got a surprise as he looked in at the bookshop window instead of the usual display of gold embossed spellbooks the size of paving slabs there was a large iron cage behind the glass that held about a hundred copies of the monster book of monsters torn pages were flying everywhere as the books grappled with each other locked together in furious wrestling matches and snapping aggressivelyharry pulled his booklist out of his pocket and consulted it for the first time the monster book of monsters was listed as the required book for care of magical creatures now harry understood why hagrid had said it would come in useful he felt relieved he had been wondering whether hagrid wanted help with some terrifying new petas harry entered flourish and blotts the manager came hurrying toward himhogwarts he said abruptly come to get your new booksyes said harry i need get out of the way said the manager impatiently brushing harry aside he drew on a pair of very thick gloves picked up a large knobbly walking stick and proceeded toward the door of the monster books cagehang on said harry quickly ive already got one of thosehave you a look of enormous relief spread over the managers facethank heavens for that ive been bitten five times already this morning a loud ripping noise rent the air two of the monster books had seized a third and were pulling it apartstop it stop it cried the manager poking the walking stick through the bars and knocking the books apart im never stocking them again never its been bedlam i thought wed

corner devoted to fortune telling a small table was stacked with volumes such as predicting the unpredictable insulate yourself against shocks and broken balls when fortunes turn foulhere you are said the manager who had climbed a set of steps to take down a thick black bound book unfogging the future very good guide to all your basic fortune telling methods palmistry crystal balls bird entrailsbut

the manager lightly looking to see what harry was staring at youll start seeing death omens everywhere its enough to frighten anyone to death but harry continued to stare at the front cover of the book it showed a black dog large as a bear with gleaming eyes it looked oddly familiarthe manager pressed unfogging the future into harrys handsanything else he saidyes said harry tearing his eyes away from the dogs and dazedly consulting his booklist er i need intermediate transfiguration and the standard book of spells grade threeharry emerged from flourish and blotts ten minutes later with his new books under his arms and made his way back to the leaky cauldron hardly noticing where he was going and bumping into several peoplehe tramped up the stairs to his room went inside and tipped his books onto his bed somebody had been in to tidy the windows were open and sun was pouring inside harry could hear the buses rolling by in the unseen muggle street behind him and the sound of the invisible crowd below in diagon alley he caught sight of himself in the mirror over the basinit cant have been a death omen he told his reflection defiantly i was panicking when i saw that thing in magnolia crescent it was probably just a stray doghe raised his hand automatically and tried to make his hair lie flat youre fighting a losing battle there dear said his mirror in a vvheezy voiceas the days slipped by harry started looking wherever he went for a sign of ron or hermione plenty of hogwarts students were arriving in diagon alley now with the start of term so near harry met seamus finnigan and dean thomas his fellow gryffindors in quality quidditch supplies where they too were ogling the firebolt he also ran into the real neville longbottom a round faced forgetful boy outside flourish and blotts harry didnt stop to chat neville appeared to have mislaid his booklist and was being told off by his very formidable looking grandmother harry hoped she never found out that hed pretended to be neville while on the run from the ministry of magicharry woke on the last day of the holidays thinking that he would at least meet ron and hermione tomorrow on the hogwarts express he got up dressed went for a last look at the firebolt and was just wondering where hed have lunch when someone yelled his name and he turnedharry harrythey were there both of them sitting outside florean fortescues ice cream parlor ron looking incredibly freckly herone very brown both waving frantically at himfinally said ron grinning at harry as he sat down we went to the leaky cauldron but they said youd left and we went to flourish and blotts and madam malkins and i got all my school stuff last week harry explained and how come you knew im staying at the leaky cauldron dad said ron simplymr weasley who worked at the ministry of magic would of course have heard the whole story of what had happened to aunt margedid you really blow up your aunt harry said hermione in a very serious voicei didnt mean to said harry while ron roared with laughter i just lost controlits not funny ron said hermione sharply honestly im amazed harry wasnt expelledso am i admitted harry forget expelled i thought i was going to be arrested he looked at ron your dad doesnt know why fudge let me off does heprobably cause its you isnt it shrugged ron still chucklingfamous harry potter and all that id

cauldron tonight too so you can come to kings cross with us tomorrow hermiones there as wellhermione nodded beaming mum and dad dropped me off this morning with all my hogwarts thingsexcellent said harry happily so have you got all your new books and stufflook at this said ron pulling a long thin box out of a bag and opening it brand new wand fourteen inches willow containing one unicorn tail hair and weve got all our books he pointed at a large bag under his chair what about those monster books eh the assistant nearly cried when we said we wanted twowhats all that hermione harry asked pointing at not one but three bulging bags in the chair next to herwell im taking more new subjects than you arent i said hermionethose are my books for arithmancy care of magical creatures divination the study of ancient runes muggle studies what are you doing muggle studies for said ron rolling his eyes at harry youre muggle born your mum and dad are muggles you already know all about mugglesbut itll be fascinating to study them from the wizarding point of view said hermione earnestlyare you planning to eat or sleep at all this year hermione asked harry while ron sniggered hermione ignored themive still got ten galleons she said checking her purse its my birthday in september and mum and dad gave me some money to get myself an early birthday presenthow about a nice book said ron innocentlyno i dont think so said hermione composedly i really want an owli mean harrys got hedwig and youve got errol i havent said ron errols a family owl all ive got is scabbershe pulled his pet rat out of his pocket and i want to get him checked over he added placing scabbers on the table in front of them i dont think egypt agreed with himscabbers was looking thinner than usual and there was a definite droop to his whiskerstheres a magical creature shop just over there said harry who knew diagon alley very well by now you could see if theyve got anything for scabbers and hermione can get her owlso they paid for their ice cream and crossed the street to the magical menageriethere wasnt much room inside every inch of wall was hidden by cagesit was smelly and very noisy because the occupants of these cages were all squeaking squawking jabbering or hissing the witch behind the counter was already advising a wizard on the care of double ended newts so harry ron and hermione waited examining the cagesa pair of enormous purple toads sat gulping wetly and feasting on dead blowflies a gigantic tortoise with a jewel encrusted shell was glittering near the window poisonous orange snails were oozing slowly up the side of their glass tank and a fat white rabbit kept changing into a silk top hat and back again with a loud popping noise then there were cats of every color a noisy cage of ravens a basket of funny custard colored furballs that were humming loudly and on the counter a vast cage of sleek black rats that were playing some sort of skipping game using their long bald tailsthe double ended newt wizard left and ron approached the counterits my rat he told the witch he been a bit off color ever since i brought him back from egyptbang him on the counter said the witch pulling a pair of heavy black spectacles out of her pocketron lifted scabbers out of his inside pocket and placed him next to the cage of his fellow rats who stopped their skipping tricks and scuffled to the wire for a better tooklike nearly everything ron owned scabbers the rat was secondhand he had once belonged to rons brother percy and a bit battered next to the glossy rats in the cage he looked especially woebegonehm said the witch picking up scabbers how old is this ratdunno said ron quite old he used to belong to my brotherwhat powers does he have said the witch examining scabbers closelyer the truth was that scabbers had never shown the faintest trace of interesting powers the witchs eyes moved from scabberss tatteredleft ear to his front paw which had a toe missing and tutted loudlyhes been through the mill this one she saidhe was like that when percy gave him to me said ron defensivelyan ordinary common or garden rat like this cant be expected to live longer than three years or so said the witch now if you were looking for something a bit more hard wearing you might like one of these she indicated the black rats who promptly started skipping again ron muttered show offswell if you dont want a replacement you can try this rat tonicsaid the witch reaching under the counter and bringing out a small red bottleokay said ron how much ouchron buckled as something huge and orange came soaring from the top of the highest cage landed on his head and then propelled itselfspitting madly at scabbersno crookshanks no cried the witch but scabbers shot from between her hands like a bar of soap landed splay legged on the floor and then scampered for the doorscabbers ron shouted racing out of the shop after him harry followedit took them nearly ten minutes to catch scabbers who had taken refuge under a wastepaper bin outside quality quidditch supplies ron stuffed the trembling rat back into his pocket and straightened up massaging his headwhat was thatit was either a very big cat or quite a small tiger said harrywheres hermioneprobably getting her owl they made their way back up the crowded street to the magical menagerieas they reached it hermione came out but she wasnt carrying an owlher arms were clamped tightly around the enormous ginger catyou bought that monster said ron his mouth hanging openhes gorgeous isnt he said hermione glowingthat was a matter of opinion thought harry the cats ginger fur was thick and fluffy but it was definitely a bit bowlegged and its face looked grumpy and oddly squashed as though it had run headlong into a brick wall now that scabbers was out of sight however the cat was purring contentedly in hermiones armsherinione that thing nearly scalped me said ronhe didnt mean to did you crookshanks said hermioneand what about scabbers said ron pointing at the lump in his chest pocket he needs rest and relaxation hows he going to get it with that thing aroundthat reminds me you forgot your rat tonic said hermione slapping the small red bottle into rons hand and stop worrying crookshanks will be sleeping in my dormitory and scabbers in yours whats the problem poor crookshanks that witch said hed been in there for ages no one wanted himwonder why said ron sarcastically as they set off toward the leaky cauldronthey found mr weasley sitting in the bar reading the daily prophetharry he said smiling as he looked up how are youfine thanks said harry as he ron and hermione joined mr weasley with a their shoppingmr weasley put down his paper and harry saw the now familiar picture of sirius black staring up at himthey still havent caught him then he askedno said mr weasley looking extremely grave theyve pulled us all off our regular jobs at the ministry to try and find him but no luck so farwould we get a reward if we caught him asked ron itd be good to get some more money dont be ridiculous ron said mr weasley who on closer inspection looked very strained blacks not going to be caught by a thirteen year old wizard its the azkaban guards wholl get him backyou mark my wordsat that moment mrs weasley entered the bar laden with shopping bags and followed by the twins fred and george who were about to start their fifth year at hogwarts the newly elected head boy percy and the weasleys youngest child and only girl ginnyginny who had always been very taken with harry seemed even more heartily embarrassed than usual when she saw him perhaps because he had saved her life during their previous year at hogwarts she went very red and muttered hello without looking at him percy however held out his hand solemnly as though he and harry had never met and said harryhow nice to see youhello percy said harry trying not to laughi hope youre well said percy pompously shaking hands it was rather like being introduced to the mayorvery well thanks harry said fred elbowing percy out of the way and bowing deeplysimply splendid to see you old boy marvelous said george pushing fred aside and seizing harrys hand in turn absolutely spiffingpercy scowledthats enough now said mrs weasleymum said fred as though hed only just spotted her and seizing her hand too how really corking to see you i said thats enough said mrs weasley depositing her shopping in an empty chair hello harry dear i suppose youve heard our exciting news she pointed to the brand new silver badge on percys chestsecond head boy in the family she said swelling with prideand last fred muttered under his breathi dont doubt that said mrs weasley frowning suddenly i notice they havent made you two prefectswhat do we want to be prefects for said george looking revolted at the very idea itd take all the fun out of lifeginny giggledyo u want to set a better example for your sister snapped mrsweasleyginnys got other brothers to set her an example mother said percy loftily im going up to change for dinnerhe disappeared and george heaved a sighwe tried to shut him in a pyramid he told harry but mum spotted usdinner that night was a very enjoyable affair tom the innkeeper put three tables together in the parlor and the seven weasleys harry and hermione ate their way through five delicious courseshowre we getting to kings cross tomorrow dad asked fred as they dug into a sumptuous chocolate puddingthe ministrys providing a couple of cars said mr weasleyeveryone looked up at himwhy said percy curiouslyits because of you perce said george seriously and therell be little flags on the hoods with hb on themfor humongous bighead said fredeveryone except percy and mrs weasley snorted into their puddingwhy are the ministry providing cars father percy asked again in a dignified voicewell as we havent got one anymore said mr weasleyand as i work there theyre doing me a favor his voice was casual but harry couldnt help noticing that mrweasleys ears had gone red just like rons did when he was under pressuregood thing too said mrs weasley briskly do you realize how much luggage youve all got between you a nice sight youd be on the muggle underground you are all packed arent youron hasnt put all his new things in his trunk yet said percy in a long suffering voice hes dumped them on my bedyoud better go and pack properly ron because we wont have much time in the morning mrs weasley called down the table ron scowled at percyafter dinner everyone felt very full and sleepy one by one they madetheir way upstairs to their rooms to check their things for the next day ron and percy were next door to harry he had just closed and locked his own trunk when he heard angry voices through the wall and went to see what was going onthe door of number twelve was ajar and percy was shoutingit was here on the bedside table i took it off for polishing i havent touched it all right ron roared backwhats up said harrymy head boy badge is gone said percy rounding on harrysos scabberss rat tonic said ron throwing things out of his trunk to look i think i mightve left it in the bar youre not going anywhere till youve found my badge yelled percyill get scabberss stuff im packed harry said to ron and he went downstairsharry was halfway along the passage to the bar which was now very darkwhen he heard another pair of angry voices coming from the parlor a second later he recognized them as mr and mrsweasleys he hesitated not wanting them to know hed heard them arguing when the sound of his own name made him stop then move closer to the parlor doormakes no sense not to tell him mr weasley was saying heatedlyharrys got a right to know ive tried to tell fudge but he insists on treating harry like a child hes thirteen years old and arthur the truth would terrify him said mrs weasley shrilly do you really want to send harry back to school with that hanging over himfor heavens sake hes happy not knowingi dont want to make him miserable i want to put him on his guardretorted mr weasley you know what harry and ron are like wandering off by themselves theyve ended up in the forbidden forest twice but harry mustnt do that this year when i think what could have happened to him that night he ran away from home if the knight bus hadnt picked him up im prepared to bet he would have been dead before the ministry found himbut hes not dead hes fine so whats the point molly they say sirius blacks mad and maybe he is but he was clever enough to escape from azkaban and thats supposed to be impossibleits been three weeks and no ones seen hide nor hair of him and i dont care what fudge keeps telling the daily prophet were no nearer catching black than inventing self spelling wands the only thing we know for sure is what blacks after but harry will be perfectly safe at hogwartswe thought azkaban was perfectly safe if black can break out of azkaban he can break into hogwartsbut no ones really sure that blacks after harry there was a thud on wood and harry was sure mr weasley had banged his fist on the tablemolly how many times do i have to tell you they didnt report it in the press because fudge wanted it kept quiet but fudge went out to azkaban the night black escaped the guards told fudge that blacks been talking in his sleep for a while now always the same words hes at hogwarts hes at hogwarts black is deranged molly and he wants harry dead if you ask me he thinks murdering harry will bring you know who back to pow er black lost everything the night harry stopped you know who and hes had twelve years alone in azkaban to brood on thatthere was a silence harry leaned still closer to the door desperate to hear morewell arthur you must do what you think is right but youreforgetting albus dumbledore i dont think anything could hurt harry at hogwarts while dumbledores headmaster i suppose he knows about all thisof course he knows we had to ask him if he minds the azkaban guards stationing themselves around the entrances to the school grounds he wasnt happy about it but he agreednot happy why shouldnt he be happy if theyre there to catch blackdumbledore isnt fond of the azkaban guards said mr weasley heavilynor am if it comes to that but when youre dealing with a wizard like black you sometimes have to join forces with those youd rather avoidif they save harry then i will never say another word against themsaid mr weasley wearily its late molly wed better go upharry heard chairs move as quietly as he could he hurried down the passage to the bar and out of sight the parlor door opened and a few seconds later footsteps told him that mr and mrs weasley were climbing the stairsthe bottle of rat tonic was lying under the table they had sat at earlier harry waited until he heard mr and mrs weasleys bedroom door close then headed back upstairs with the bottlefred and george were crouching in the shadows on the landing heaving with laughter as they listened to percy dismantling his and rons room in search of his badgeweve got it fred whispered to harry weve been improving itthe badge now read bighead boyharry forced a laugh went to give ron the rat tonic then shut himself in his room and lay down on his bedso sirius black was after him this explained everything fudge had been lenient with him because he was so relieved to find him alive hed madeharry promise to stay in diagon alley where there were plenty of wizards to keep an eye on him and he was sending two ministry cars to take them all to the station tomorrow so that the weasleys could look after harry until he was on the trainharry lay listening to the muffled shouting next door and wondered why he didnt feel more scared sirius black had murdered thirteen people with one curse mr and mrs weasley obviously thought harry would be panic stricken if he knew the truth but harry happened to agree wholeheartedly with mrs weasley that the safest place on earth was wherever albus dumbledore happened to be didnt people always say that dumbledore was the only person lord voldemort had ever been afraid ofsurely black as voldemorts right hand man would be just as frightened of himand then there were these azkaban guards everyone kept talking aboutthey seemed to scare most people senseless and if they were stationed all around the school blacks chances of getting inside seemed very remoteno all in all the thing that bothered harry most was the fact that his chances of visiting hogsmeade now looked like zero nobody would want harry to leave the safety of the castle until black was caught in factharry suspected his every move would be carefully watched until the danger had passedhe scowled at the dark ceiling did they think he couldnt look after himself hed escaped lord voldemort three times he wasnt completely uselessunbidden the image of the beast in the shadows of magnolia crescent crossed his mind what to do when you know the worst is comingim not going to be murdered harry said out loudthats the spirit dear said his mirror sleepilychapter five the dementortom woke harry the next morning with his usual toothless grin and a cup of tea harry got dressed and was just persuading a disgruntled hedwig to get back into her cage when ron banged his way into the room pulling a sweatshirt over his head and looking irritablethe sooner we get on the train the better he said at least i can get away from percy at hogwarts now hes accusing me of dripping tea on his photo of penelope clearwater you know ron grimaced his girlfriend shes hidden her face under the frame because her nose has gone all blotchyive got something to tell you harry began but they were interrupted by fred and george who had looked in to congratulate ron on infuriating percy againthey headed down to breakfast where mr weasley was reading the front page of the daily prophet with a furrowed brow and mrs weasley was telling hermione and ginny about a love potion shed made as a young girl all three of them were rather gigglywhat were you saying ron asked harry as they sat downlater harry muttered as percy stormed inharry had no chance to speak to ron or hermione in the chaos of leaving they were too busy heaving all their trunks down the leaky cauldrons narrow staircase and piling them up near the door with hedwig and hermes percys screech owl perched on top in their cages a small wickerwork basket stood beside the heap of trunks spitting loudlyits all right crookshanks hermione cooed through the wickerworkill let you out on the trainyou wont snapped ron what about poor scabbers ehhe pointed at his chest where a large lump indicated that scabbers was curled up in his pocketmr weasley who had been outside waiting for the ministry cars stuckhis head insidetheyre here he said harry come onmr weasley marched harry across the short stretch of pavement toward the first of two old fashioned dark green cars each of which was driven by a furtive looking wizard wearing a suit of emerald velvetin you get harry said mr weasley glancing up and down the crowded streetharry got into the back of the car and was shortly joined by hermioneron and to rons disgust percythe journey to kings cross was very uneventful compared with harrys trip on the knight bus the ministry of magic cars seemed almost ordinary though harry noticed that they could slide through gaps that uncle vernons new company car certainly couldnt have managed they reached kings cross with twenty minutes to spare the ministry drivers found them trolleys unloaded their trunks touched their hats in salute to mr weasley and drove away somehow managing to jump to the head of an unmoving line at the traffic lightsmr weasley kept close to harrys elbow all the way into the stationright then he said glancing around them lets do this in pairs as there are so many of us ill go through first with harrymr weasley strolled toward the barrier between platforms nine and tenpushing harrys trolley and apparently very interested in the intercity that had just arrived at platform nine with a meaningful look at harry he leaned casually against the barrier harry imitated himin a moment they had fallen sideways through the solid metal onto platform nine and three quarters and looked up to see the hogwarts express a scarlet steam engine puffing smoke over a platform packed with witches and wizards seeing their children onto the trainpercy and ginny suddenly appeared behind harry they were panting and had apparently taken the barrier at a runah theres penelope said percy smoothing his hair and going pink again ginny caught harrys eye and they both turned away to hide their laughter as percy strode over to a girl with long curly hair walking with his chest thrown out so that she couldnt miss his shiny badgestood back to let him on they leaned out of the window and waved at mrand mrs weasley until the train turned a corner and blocked them from viewi need to talk to you in private harry muttered to ron and hermione as the train picked up speedgo away ginny said ronoh thats nice said ginny huffily and she stalked offharry ron and hermione set off down the corridor looking for an empty compartment but all were full except for the one at the very end of the trainthis had only one occupant a man sitting fast asleep next to the window harry ron and hermione checked on the threshold the hogwarts express was usually reserved for students and they had never seen an adult there before except for the witch who pushed the food cartthe stranger was wearing an extremely shabby set of wizards robes that had been darned in several places he looked ill and exhausted though quite young his light brown hair was flecked with graywho dyou reckon he is ron hissed as they sat down and slid the door shut taking the seats farthest away from the windowprofessor r j lupin whispered hermione at oncehow dyou know thatits on his case she replied pointing at the luggage rack over the mans head where there was a small battered case held together with a large quantity of neatly knotted string the name professor r j lupin was stamped across one corner in peeling letterswonder what he teaches said ron frowning at professor lupins pallid profilethats obvious whispered hermione theres only one vacancy isnt there defense against the dark artsharry ron and hermione had already had two defense against the dark arts teachers both of whom had lasted only one year there were rumors that the job was jinxedwell i hope hes up to it said ron doubtfully he looks like ongood hex would finish him off doesnt he anyway he turned to harry what were you going to tell usharry explained all about mr and mrs weasleys argument and the warning mr weasley had just given him \when hed finished ron looked thunderstruck and hermione had her hands over her mouth she finally lowered them to say sirius black escaped to come after you ohharry youll have to be really really careful dont go looking for trouble harry i dont go looking for trouble said harry nettled trouble usually finds mehow thick would harry have to be to go looking for a nutter who wants to kill him said ron shakilythey were taking the news worse than harry had expected both ron and hermione seemed to be much more frightened of black than he wasno one knows how he got out of azkaban said ron uncomfortably no ones ever done it before and he was a top security prisoner toobut theyll catch him wont they said hermione earnestly i meantheyve got all the muggles looking out for him too whats that noise said ron suddenlya faint tinny sort of whistle was coming from somewhere the looked all around the compartmentits coming from your trunk harry said ron standing up and reaching into the luggage rack a moment later he had pulled the pocket sneakoscope out from between harrys robes it was spinning very fast in the palm of rons hand and glowing brilliantlyis that a sneakoscope said hermione interestedly standing up for a better lookyeah mind you its a very cheap one ron said it went haywire just as i was tying it to errols leg to send it to harrywere you doing anything untrustworthy at the time said hermione shrewdlyno well i wasnt supposed to be using errol you know hes not really up to long journeys but how else was i supposed to get harrys present to himstick it back in the trunk harry advised as the sneakoscope whistled piercingly or itll wake him uphe nodded toward professor lupin ron stuffed the sneakoscope into a particularly horrible pair of uncle vernons old socks which deadened the sound then closed the lid of the trunk on itwe could get it checked in hogsmeade said ron sitting back downthey sell that sort of thing in dervish and banges magical instruments and stuff fred and george told medo you know much about hogsmeade asked hermione keenly ive read its the only entirely non muggle settlement in britain yeah i think it is said ron in an offhand sort of waybut thats not why i want to go i just want to get inside honey dukeswhats that said hermioneits this sweetshop said ron a dreamy look coming over his facewhere theyve got everything pepper imps they make you smoke at the mouth and great fat chocoballs full of strawberry mousse and clotted cream and really excellent sugar quills which you can suck in class and just look like youre thinking what to write next but hogsmeades a very interesting place isnt it hermione pressed on eagerly in sites of historical sorcery it says the inn was the headquarters for the goblin rebellion and the shrieking shades supposed to be the most severely haunted building in britain and massive sherbert balls that make you levitate a few inches off the ground while youre sucking them said ron who was plainly not listening to a word hermione was sayinghermione looked around at harrywont it be nice to get out of school for a bit and explore hogsmeadespect it will said harry heavily youll have to tell me when youve found outwhat dyou mean said roni cant go the dursleys didnt sign my permission form and fudge wouldnt eitherron looked horrifiedyoure not allowed to come but no way mcgonagall or someone will give you permission musclely crabbe was taller with a pudding bowl haircut and a very thick neck goyle had short bristly hair and long gorilla ish armswell look who it is said malfoy in his usual lazy drawl pulling open the compartment door potty and the weaselcrabbe and goyle chuckled trollishlyi heard your father finally got his hands on some gold this summerweasley said malfoy did your mother die of shockron stood up so quickly he knocked crookshankss basket to the floorprofessor lupin gave a snortwhos that said malfoy taking an automatic step backward as he spotted lupinnew teacher said harry who got to his feet too in case he needed to hold ron back what were you saying malfoymalfoys pale eyes narrowed he wasnt fool enough to pick a fight right under a teachers nosecmon he muttered resentfully to crabbe and goyle and they disappearedharry and ron sat down again ron massaging his knucklesim not going to take any crap from malfoy this year he said angrilyi mean it if he makes one more crack about my family im going to get hold of his head and ron made a violent gesture in midairron hissed hermione pointing at professor lupin be carefulbut professor lupin was still fast asleepthe rain thickened as the train sped yet farther north the windows were now a solid shimmering gray which graduily darkened until lanterns flickered into life all along the corridors and over the luggage racksthe train rattled the rain hammered the ind roared but stillprofessor lupin sleptwe must be nearly there said ron leaning forward to look past professor lupin at the now completely black windowthe words had hardly left him when the train started to slow downgreat said ron getting up and walking carefully past professor lupin to try and see outside im starving i want to get to the feastwe cant be there yet said hermione checking her watchso whyre we stoppingthe train was getting slower and slower as the noise of the pistons fell away the wind and rain sounded louder than ever against the windowsharry who was nearest the door got up to look into the corridor all along the carriage heads were sticking curiously out of their compartmentsthe train came to a stop with a jolt and distant thuds and bangs told them that luggage had fallen out of the racks then without warningall the lamps went out and they were plunged into total darknesswhats going on said rons voice from behind harryouch gasped hermione ron that was my footharry felt his way back to his seatdyou think weve broken downdunnothere was a squeaking sound and harry saw the dim black outline of ronwiping a patch clean on the window and peering outtheres something moving out there ron said i think people are coming aboardthe compartment door suddenly opened and someone fell painfully over harrys legssorry dyou know whats going on ouch sorryhullo neville said harry feeling around in the dark and pulling neville up by his cloakharry is that you whats happeningno idea sit down there was a loud hissing and a yelp of pain neville had tried to sit on crookshanksim going to go and ask the driver whats going on came hermiones voice harry felt her pass him heard the door

nevillequiet said a hoarse voice suddenlyprofessor lupin appeared to have woken up at last harry could hear movements in his cornernone of them spokethere was a soft crackling noise and a shivering light filled the compartment professor lupin appeared to be holding a handful of flamesthey illuminated his tired gray face but his eyes looked alert andwarystay where you are he said in the same hoarse voice and he got slowly to his feet with his handful of fire held out in front of himbut the door slid slowly open before lupin could reach itstanding in the doorway illuminated by the shivering flames in lupins hand was a cloaked figure that towered to the ceiling its face was completely hidden beneath its hood harrys eyes darted downward and what he saw made his stomach contract there was a hand protruding from the cloak and it was glistening grayish slimy looking and scabbedlike something dead that had decayed in waterbut it was visible only for a split second as though the creature beneath the cloak sensed harrys gaze the hand was suddenly withdrawn into the folds of its black cloakand then the thing beneath the hood whatever it was drew a long slowrattling breath as though it were trying to suck something more than air from its surroundingsan intense cold swept over them all harry felt his own breath catch in his chest the cold went deeper than his skin it was inside his chestit was inside his very heartharrys eyes rolled up into his head he couldnt see he was drowning in cold there was a rushing in his ears as though of water he was being dragged downward the roaring growing louder and then from far away he heard screaming terrible terrifiedpleading screams he wanted to help whoever it was he tried to move his arms but couldnt a thick white fog was swirling around him inside him harry harry are you all rightsomeone was slapping his facew whatharry opened his eyes there were lanterns above him and the floor was shaking the hogwarts express was moving again and the lights had come back on he seemed to have slid out of his seat onto the floor ron and hermione were kneeling next to him and above them he could see neville and professor lupin watching harry felt very sick when he put up his hand to push his glasses back on he felt cold sweat on his faceron and hermione heaved him back onto his seatare you okay ron asked nervouslyyeah said harry looking quickly toward the door the hooded creature had vanished what happened wheres that that thing who screamedno one screamed said ron more nervously stillharry looked around the bright compartment ginny and neville looked back at him both very palebut i heard screaming a loud snap made them all jump professor lupin was breaking an enormous slab of chocolate into pieceshere he said to harry handing him a particularly large piece eat it itll helpharry took the chocolate but didnt eat itwhat was that thing he asked lupina dementor said lupin who was now giving chocolate to everyone elseone of the dementors of azkabaneveryone stared at him professor lupin crumpled up the empty chocolate wrapper and put it in his pocketeat he repeated itll help i need to speak to the driver excuse mehe strolled past harry and disappeared into the corridorare you sure youre okay harry said hermione watching harry anxiouslyi dont get it what happened said harry wiping more sweat off his facewell that thing the dementor stood there and looked around i mean i think it did i couldnt see its face and you you i thought you were having a fit or something said ron who still looked scared you went sort of rigid and fell out of your seat and started twitching and professor lupin stepped over you and walked toward the dementorand pulled out his wand said hermione and he said none of us is hiding sirius black under our cloaks go but the dementor didnt moveso lupin muttered something and a silvery thing shot out of his wand at it and it turned around and sort of glided away it was horrible said neville in a higher voice than usual did you feel how cold it got when it came ini felt weird said ron shifting his shoulders uncomfortably like id never be cheerful againginny who was huddled in her corner looking nearly as bad as harry felt gave a small sob hermione went over and put a comforting arm around herbut didnt any of you fall off your seats said harry awkwardlyno said ron looking anxiously at harry again ginny was shaking like mad thoughharry didnt understand he felt weak and shivery as though he were recovering from a bad bout of flu he also felt the beginnings of shamewhy had he gone to pieces like that when no one else hadprofessor lupin had come back he paused as he entered looked aroundand said with a small smile i havent poisoned that chocolate you knowharry took a bite and to his great surprise felt warmth spread suddenly to the tips of his fingers and toeswell be at hogwarts in ten minutes said professor lupin are you all right harryharry didnt ask how professor lupin knew his namefine he muttered embarrassedthey didnt talk much during the remainder of the journey at long lastthe train stopped at hogsmeade station and there was a great scramble to get outside owls hooted cats meowed and nevilles pet toad croaked loudly from under his hat it was freezing on the tiny platform rain was driving down in icy sheetsfirs years this way called a familiar voice harry ron and hermione turned and saw the gigantic outline of hagrid at the other end of the platform beckoning the terrified looking new students forward for their traditional journey across the lakeall right you three hagrid yelled over the heads of the crowd they waved at him but had no chance to speak to him because the mass of people around them was shunting them away along the platform harryron and hermione followed the rest of the school along the platform and out onto a rough mud track where at least a hundred stagecoaches awaited the remaining students each pulled harry could only assume by an invisible horse because when they climbed inside and shut the doorthe coach set off all by itself bumping and swaying in processionthe coach smelled faintly of mold and straw harry felt better since the chocolate but still weak ron and hermione kept looking at him sideways as though frightened he might collapse againas the carriage trundled toward a pair of magnificent wrought irongates flanked with stone columns topped with winged boarsharry saw two more towering hooded dementors standing guard on either side a wave of cold sickness threatened to engulf him again he leaned back into the lumpy seat and closed his eyes until they had passed the gates the carriage picked up speed on the long sloping drive up to the castle hermione was leaning out of the tiny window watching the many turrets and towers draw nearer at last the carriage swayed to a haltand hermione and ron got outas harry stepped down a drawling delighted voice sounded in his earyou fainted potter is longbottorn telling the truth you actualy faintedmalfoy elbowed past hermione to block harrys way up the stone steps to the castle his face gleeful and his pale eyes glinting maliciouslyshove off malfoy said ron whose jaw was clencheddid you faint as well weasley said malfoy loudly did the scary old dementor frighten you too weasleyis there a problem said a mild voice professor lupin had just gotten out of the next carriagemalfoy gave professor lupin an insolent stare which took in the patches on his robes and the delapidated suitcase with a tiny hint of sarcasm in his voice he said oh no er professor then he smirked at crabbe and goyle and led them up the steps into the castlehermione prodded ron in the back to make him hurry and the three of them joined the crowd swarming up the steps through the giant oak front doors into the cavernous entrance hall which was lit with flaming torches and housed a magnificent marble staircase that led to the upper floorsthe door into the great hall stood open at the right harry followed the crowd toward it but had barely glimpsed the enchanted ceiling which was black and cloudy tonight when a voice called potter granger i want to see you bothharry and hermione turned around surprised professor mcgonagalltransfiguration teacher and head of gryffindor house was calling over the heads of the crowd she was a sternlooking witch who wore her hair in a tight bun her sharp eyes were framed with square spectacles harry fought his way over to her with a feeling of foreboding professor mcgonagall had a way of making him feel he must have done something wrongtheres no need to look so worried i just want a word in my officeshe told them move along there weasleyron stared as professor mcgonagall ushered harry and hermione away from the chattering crowd they accompanied her across the entrance hall up the marble staircase and along a corridoronce they were in her office a small room with a large welcoming fireprofessor mcgonagall motioned harry and hermione to sit down she settled herself behind her desk and said abruptly professor lupin sent an owl ahead to say that you were taken ill on the train potterbefore harry could reply there was a soft knock on the door and madam pomfrey the nurse came bustling inharry felt himself going red in the face it was bad enough that hed passed out or whatever he had done without everyone making all this fussim fine he said i dont need anything oh its you is it said madam pomfrey ignoring this and bending down to stare closely at him i suppose youve been doing something dangerous againit was a dementor poppy said professor mcgonagallthey exchanged a dark look and madam pomfrey clucked disapprovinglysetting dementors around a school she muttered pushing back harrys hair and feeling his forehead he wont be the last one who collapsesyes hes all clammy terrible things they are and the effect they have on people who are already delicate im not delicate said harry crosslyof course youre not said madam pomfrey absentmindedly now taking his pulsewhat does he need said professor mcgonagall crisply bed restshould he perhaps spend tonight in the hospital wingim fine said harry jumping up the thought of what draco malfoy would say if he had to go to the hospital wing was torturewell he should have some chocolate at the very least said madam pomfrey who was now trying to peer into harrys eyesive already had some said harry professor lupin gave me some he gave it to all of usdid he now said madam pomfrey approvingly so weve finally got a defense against the dark arts teacher who knows his remediesare you sure you feel all right potter professor mcgonagall said sharplyyes said harryvery well kindly wait outside while i have a quick word with miss granger about her course schedule then we can go down to the feast togetherharry went back into the corridor with madam pomfrey who left for the hospital wing muttering to herself he had to wait only a few minutes then hermione emerged looking very happy about something followed by professor mcgonagall and the three of them made their way back down the marble staircase to the great hallit was a sea of pointed black hats each of the long house tables was lined with students their faces glimmering by the light of thousands ofcandles which were floating over the tables in midair professor flitwick who was a tiny little wizard with a shock of white hair was carrying an ancient hat and a three legged stool out of the halloh said hermione softly weve missed the sortingnew students at hogwarts were sorted into houses by trying on the sorting hat which shouted out the house they were best suited to gryffindor ravenclaw hufflepuff or slytherin professor mcgonagall strode off toward her empty seat at the staff table and harry and hermione set off in the other direction as quietly as possible toward the gryffindor table people looked around at them as they passed along the back of the hall and a few of them pointed at harry had the story of his collapsing in front of the dementor traveled that fasthe and hermione sat down on either side of ron who had saved them seatswhat was all that about he muttered to harryharry started to explain in a whisper but at that moment the headmaster stood up to speak and he broke offprofessor dumbledore though very old always gave an impression of great energy he had several feet of long silver hair and beardhalf moon spectacles and an extremely crooked nose he was often described as the greatest wizard of the age but that wasnt why harry respected him you couldnt help trusting albus dumbledore and as harry watched him beaming around at the students he felt really calm for the first time since the dementor had entered the train compartmentwelcome said dumbledore the candlelight shimmering on his beardwelcome to another year at hogwarts i have a few things to say to you all and as one of them is very serious i think it best to get it out of the way before you become befuddled by our excellent feastdumbledore cleared his throat and continued as you will all be aware after their search of the hogwarts express our school is presently playing host to some of the dementors of azkaban who are here on ministry of magic businesshe paused and harry remembered what mr weasley had said about dumbledore not being happy with the dementors guarding the schoolthey are stationed at every entrance to the grounds dumbledore continued and while they are with us i must make it plain that nobody is to leave school without permission dementors are not to be fooled by tricks or disguises or even invisibility cloaks he added blandlyand harry and ron glanced at each other it is not in the nature of a dementor to understand pleading or excuses i therefore warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you i look to the prefects and our new head boy and girl to make sure that no student runs afoul of the dementors he saidpercy who was sitting a few seats down from harry puffed out his chest again and stared around impressively dumbledore paused again he looked very seriously around the hall and nobody moved or made a soundon a happier note he continued i am pleased to welcome two new teachers to our ranks this yearfirst professor lupin who has kindly consented to fill the post of defense against the dark arts teacherthere was some scattered rather unenthusiastic applause only those who had been in the compartment on the train with professor lupin clapped hard harry among them professor lupin looked particularly shabby next to all the other teachers in their best robeslook at snape ron hissed in harrys earprofessor snape the potions master was staring along the staff table at professor lupin it was common knowledge that snape anted the defense against the dark arts job but even harry who hated snape was startled at the expression twisting his thin sallow face it was beyond anger it was loathing harry knew that expression only too well it was the look snape wore every time he set eyes on harryas to our second new appointment dumbledore continued as the lukewarm applause for professor lupin died away well i am sorry to tell youthat professor kettleburn our care of magical creatures teacherretired at the end of last year in order to enjoy more time with his remaining limbs however i am delighted to say that his place will be filled by none other than rubeus hagrid who has agreed to take on this teaching job in addition to his gamekeeping dutiesharry ron and hermione stared at one another stunned then they joined in with the applause which was tumultuous at the gryffindor table in particular harry leaned forward to see hagrid who was ruby red in the face and staring down at his enormous hands his wide grin hidden in the tangle of his black beardwe shouldve known ron roared pounding the table who else would have assigned us a biting bookharry ron and hermione were the last to stop clapping and as professor dumbledore started speaking again they saw that hagrid was wiping his eyes on the tableclothwell i think thats everything of importance said dumbledore let the feast beginthe golden plates and goblets before them filled suddenly with food and drink harry suddenly ravenous helped himself to everything he could reach and began to eatit was a delicious feast the hall echoed with talk laughter and the clatter of knives and forks harry ron and hermione however were eager for it to finish so that they could talk to hagrid they knew how much being made a teacher would mean to him hagrid wasnt a fully qualified wizard he had been expelled from hogwarts in his third year for a crime he had not committed it had been harry ron and hermione who had cleared hagrids name last yearat long last when the last morsels of pumpkin tart had melted from the golden platters dumbledore gave the word that it was time for them all to go to bed and they got their chancecongratulations hagrid hermione squealed as they reached the teachers tableall down ter you three said hagrid wiping his shining face on his napkin as he looked up at them can believe it great mandumbledore came straight down to me hut after professor kettleburn said hed had enough its what i always wanted overcome with emotion he buried his face in his napkin and professor mcgonagall shooed them awayharry ron and hermione joined the gryffindors streaming up the marble staircase and very tired now along more corridors up more and more stairs to the hidden entrance to gryffindor towers large portrait of a fat lady in a pink dress asked them passwordcoming through coming through percy called from behind the crowdthe new passwords fortuna majoroh no said neville longbottom sadly he always had trouble remembering the passwordsthrough the portrait hole and across the common room the girls and boys divided toward their separate staircases harry climbed the spiral stair with no thought in his head except how glad he was to be back they reached their familiar circular dormitory with its five four poster beds and harry looking around felt he was home at lastchapter six talons and tea leaveswhen harry ron and hermione entered the great hall for breakfast the next day the first thing they saw was draco malfoy who seemed to be entertaining a large group of slytherins with a very funny story as they passed malfoy did a ridiculous impression of a swooning fit and there was a roar of laughterignore him said hermione who was right behind harry just ignore him its not worth ithey potter shrieked pansy parkinson a slytherin girl with a facelike a pug potter the dementors are coming potter wooooooooooharry dropped into a seat at the gryffindor table next to george weasleynew third year course schedules said george passing then overwhats up with you harrymalfoy said ron sitting down on georges other side and glaring over at the slytherin tablegeorge looked up in time to see malfoy pretending to faint with terror againthat little git he said calmly he wasnt so cocky last night when the dementors were down at our end of the train came runing into our compartment didnt he frednearly wet himself said fred with a contemptuous glance at malfoyi wasnt too happy myself said george theyre horrible thingsthose dementorssort of freeze your insides dont they said fredyou didnt pass out though did you said harry in a low voiceforget it harry said george bracingly dad had to go out to azkaban one time remember fred and he said it was the worst place hed ever been he came back all weak and shaking they suck the happiness out of a place dementors most of the prisoners go mad in thereanyway well see how happy malfoy looks after our first quidditch match said fred gryffindor versus slytherin first game of the season rememberthe only time harry and malfoy had faced each other in a quidditch match malfoy had definitely come off worse feeling slightly more cheerful harry helped himself to sausages and fried tomatoeshermione was examining her new scheduleooh good were starting some new subjects today she said happilyvillains are these that trespass upon my private lands come i scorn at my fall perchance draw you knaves you dogsthey watched in astonishment as the little knight tugged his sword out of its scabbard and began brandishing it violently hopping up and down in rage but the sword was too long for him a particularly wild swing made him overbalance and he landed facedown in the grassare you all right said harry moving closer to the pictureget back you scurvy braggart back you roguethe knight seized his sword again and used it to push himself back upbut the blade sank deeply into the grass and though he pulled with all his might he couldnt get it out again finally he had to flop back down onto the grass and push up his visor to mop his sweating facelisten said harry taking advantage of the knights exhaustionwere looking for the north tower you dont know the way do youa quest the knights rage seemed to vanish instantly he clanked to his feet and shouted come follow me dear friends and we shall find our goal or else shall perish bravely in the chargehe gave the sword another fruitless tug tried and failed to mount the fat pony gave up and cried on foot then good sirs and gentle ladyon onand he ran clanking loudly into the left side of the frame and out of sightthey hurried after him along the corridor following the sound of his armor every now and then they spotted him running through a picture aheadbe of stout heart the worst is yet to come yelled the knight and they saw him reappear in front of an alarmed group of women incrinolines whose picture hung on the wall of a narrow spiral staircasepuffing loudly harry ron and hermione climbed the tightly spiraling steps getting dizzier and dizzier until at last they heard the murmur of voices above them and knew they had reached the classroomfarewell cried the knight popping his head into a painting of some sinister looking monks farewell my comrades in arms if ever you have need of noble heart and steely sinew call upon sir cadoganyeah well call you muttered ron as the knight disappeared if we ever need someone mentalthey climbed the last few steps and emerged onto a tiny landing where most of the class was already assembled there were no doors off this landing but ron nudged harry and pointed at the ceiling where there was a circular trapdoor with a brass plaque on itsibyll trelawney divination teacher harry read howre we supposed to get up thereas though in answer to his question the trapdoor suddenly opened and a silvery ladder descended right at harrys feet everyone got quietafter you said ron grinning so harry climbed the ladder firsthe emerged into the strangest looking classroom he had ever seen in fact it didnt look like a classroom at all more like a cross between someones attic and an old fashioned tea shop at leasttwenty smallcircular tables were crammed inside it all surrounded by chintz armchairs and fat little poufs everything was lit with a dim crimson light the curtains at the windows were all closed and the many lamps were draped with dark red scarves it was stiflingly warm and the fire that was burning under the crowded mantelpiece was giving off a heavysickly sort of perfume as it heated a large copper kettle the shelves running around the circular walls were crammed with dusty looking feathers stubs of candles many packs of tattered playing cardscountless silvery crystal balls and a huge array of teacupsron appeared at harrys shoulder as the class assembled around them alltalking in whisperswhere is she ron saida voice came suddenly out of the shadows a soft misty sort of voicewelcome it said how nice to see you in the physical world at lastharrys immediate impression was of a large glittering insectprofessor trelawney moved into the firelight and they saw that she was very thin her large glasses magnified her eyes to several times their natural size and she was draped in a gauzy spangled shawl innumerable chains and beads hung around her spindly neck and her arms and hands were encrusted with bangles and ringssit my children sit she said and they all climbed awkwardly into armchairs or sank onto poufs harry ron and hermione sat themselves around the same round tablewelcome to divination said professor trelawney who had seated herself in a winged armchair in front of the fire my name is professor trelawney you may not have seen me before i find that descending too often into the hustle and bustle of the main school clouds my inner eyenobody said anything to this extraordinary pronouncement professor trelawney delicately rearranged her shawl and continued so you have chosen to study divination the most difficult of all magical arts i must warn you at the outset that if you do not have the sight there is very little i will be able to teach you books can take you only so far in this fieldat these words both harry and ron glanced grinning at hermione who looked startled at the news that books wouldnt be much help in this subjectmany witches and wizards talented though they are in the area of loud bangs and smells and sudden disappearings are yet unable to penetrate the veiled mysteries of the future professor trelawney went on her enormous gleaming eyes moving from face to nervous face it is a giftgranted to few you boy she said suddenly to neville who almost toppled off his pouf is your grandmother welli think so said neville tremulouslyi wouldnt be so sure if i were you dear said professor trelawneythe firelight glinting on her long emerald earrings neville gulpedprofessor trelawney continued placidly we will be covering the basic methods of divination this year the first term will be devoted to reading the tea leaves next term we shall progress to palmistry by the way my dear she shot suddenly at parvati patil beware a red haired manparvati gave a startled look at ron who was right behind her and edged her chair away from himin the second term professor trelawney went on we shall progress to the crystal ball if we have finished with fire omens that isunfortunately classes will be disrupted in february by a nasty bout of flu i myself will lose my voice and around easter one of our number will leave us forevera very tense silence followed this pronouncement but professor trelawney seemed unaware of iti wonder dear she said to lavender brown who was nearest and shrank back in her chair if you could pass me the largest silver teapotlavender looking relieved stood up took an enormous teapot from the shelf and put it down on the table in front of professor trelawneythank you my dear incidentally that thing you are dreading it will happen on friday the sixteenth of octoberlavender tremblednow i want you all to divide into pairs collect a teacup from the shelf come to me and i will fill it then sit down and drink drink until only the dregs remain swill these around the cup three times with the left hand then turn the cup upside down on its saucer wait for thelast of the tea to drain away then give your cup to your partner to read you will interpret the patterns using pages five and six of unfogging the future i shall move among you helping and instructingoh and dear she caught neville by the arm as he made to stand up after youve broken your first cup would you be so kind as to select one of the blue patterned ones im rather attached to the pinksure enough neville had no sooner reached the shelf of teacups when there was a tinkle of breaking china professor trelawney swept over to him holding a dustpan and brush and said one of the blue ones thendear if you wouldnt mind thank you when harry and ron had had their teacups filled they went back to their table and tried to drink the scalding tea quickly they swilled the dregs around as professor trelawney had instructed then drained the cups and swapped overright said ron as they both opened their books at pages five and sixwhat can you see in minea load of soggy brown stuff said harry the heavily perfumed smoke in the room was making him feel sleepy and stupidbroaden your minds my dears and allow your eyes to see past the mundane professor trelawney cried through the gloomharry tried to pull himself togetherright youve got a crooked sort of cross he consulted unfogging the future that means youre going to have trials and suffering sorry about that but theres a thing that could be the sun hang on that means great happiness so youre going to suffer but be very happyyou need your inner eye tested if you ask me said ron and they both had to stifle their laughs as professor trelawney gazed in their directionmy turn ron peered into harrys teacup his forehead wrinkled with effort theres a blob a bit like a bowler hat he said maybe youregoing to work for the ministry of magiche turned the teacup the other way upbut this way it looks more like an acorn whats that he scanned his copy of unfogging the future a windfall unexpected gold excellent you can lend me some and theres a thin here he turned the cup again that looks like an animal yeah if that was its head it looks like a hippo no a sheepprofessor trelawney whirled around as harry let out a snort of laughterlet me see that my dear she said reprovingly to ron sweeping over and snatching harrys cup from him everyone went quiet to watchprofessor trelawney was staring into the teacup rotating it counterclockwisethe falcon my dear you have a deadly enemybut everyone knows that said hermione in a loud whisper professor trelawney stared at herwell they do said hermione everybody knows about harry and you know whoharry and ron stared at her with a mixture of amazement and admirationthey had never heard hermione speak to a teacher like that beforeprofessor trelawney chose not to reply she lowered her huge eyes to harrys cup again and continued to turn itthe club an attack dear dear this is not a happy cupi thought that was a bowler hat said ron sheepishlythe skull danger in your path my deareveryone was staring transfixed at professor trelawney who gave the cup a final turn gasped and then screamedthere was another tinkle of breaking china neville had smashed his second cup professor trelawney sank into a vacant armchair her glittering hand at her heart and her eyes closedmy dear boy my poor dear boy no it is kinder not to say nodont ask mewhat is it professor said dean thomas at once everyone had got to their feet and slowly they crowded around harry and rons tablepressing close to professor trelawneys chair to get a good look at harrys cupmy dear professor trelawneys huge eyes opened dramaticallyyou have the grimthe what said harryhe could tell that he wasnt the only one who didnt understand dean thomas shrugged at him and lavender brown looked puzzled but nearly everybody else clapped their hands to their mouths in horrorthe grim my dear the grim cried professor trelawney who looked shocked that harry hadnt understood the giant spectral dog that haunts churchyards my dear boy it is an omen the worst omen of deathharrys stomach lurched that dog on the cover of death omens in flourish and blotts the dog in the shadows of magnolia crescentlavender brown clapped her hands to her mouth too everyone was looking at harry everyone except hermione who had gotten up and moved around to the back of professor trelawneys chairi dont think it looks like a grim she said flatlyprofessor trelawney surveyed hermione with mounting dislikeyoull forgive me for saying so my dear but i perceive very little aura around you very little receptivity to the resonances of thefuture seamus finnigan was tilting his head from side to sideit looks like a grim if you do this he said with his eyes almost shut but it looks more like a donkey from here he said leaning to the leftwhen youve all finished deciding whether im going to die or notsaid harry taking even himself by surprise now nobody seemed to want to look at himi think we will leave the lesson here for today said professor trelawney in her mistiest voice yes please pack away your thingssilently the class took their teacups back to professor trelawneypacked away their books and closed their bags even ron was avoiding harrys eyesuntil we meet again said professor trelawney faintly fair fortune be yours oh and dear she pointed at neville youll be late next time so mind you work extra hard to catch upharry ron and hermione descended professor trelawneys ladder and the winding stair in silence then set off for professor mcgonagalls transfiguration lesson it took them so long to find her classroom thatearly as they had left divination they were only just in timeharry chose a seat right at the back of the room feeling as though he were sitting in a very bright spotlight the rest of the class kept shooting furtive glances at him as though he were about to drop dead at any moment he hardly heard what professor mcgonagall was telling them about animagi wizards who could transform at will into animals and wasnt even watching when she transformed herself in front of their eyes into a tabby cat with spectacle markings around her eyesreally what has got into you all today said professor mcgonagallturning back into herself with a faint pop and staring around at them all not that it matters but thats the first time my transformations not got applause from a classeverybodys heads turned toward harry again but nobody spoke then hermione raised her handplease professor weve just had our first divination class and we were reading the tea leaves and ah of course said professor mcgonagall suddenly frowningthere is no need to say any more miss granger tell me which of you will be dying this yeareveryone stared at herme said harry finallyi see said professor mcgonagall fixing harry with her beady eyesthen you should know potter that sibyll trelawney has predicted the death of one student a year since she arrived at this school none of them has died yet seeing death omens is her favorite way of greeting a new class if it were not for the fact that i never speak ill of my colleagues professor mcgonagall broke off and they saw that her nostrils had gone white she went on more calmly divination is one of the most imprecise branches of magic i shall not conceal from you that i have very little patience with it true seers are very rare and professor trelawney she stopped again and then said in a very matter of fact tone you look in excellent health to me potter so you will excuse me if i dont let you off homework today i assure you that if you die you need not hand it inhermione laughed harry felt a bit better it was harder to feel scared of a lump of tea leaves away from the dim red light and befuddling perfume of professor trelawneys classroom not everyone was convincedhowever ron still looked worried and lavender whispered but what about nevilles cupwhen the transfiguration class had finished they joined the crowdthundering toward the great hall for lunchron cheer up said hermione pushing a dish of stew toward him you heard what professor mcgonagall saidron spooned stew onto his plate and picked up his fork but didnt startharry he said in a low serious voice you havent seen a great black dog anywhere have youyeah i have said harry i saw one the night i left the dursleys ron let his fork fall with a clatterprobably a stray said hermione calmlyron looked at hermione as though she had gone madhermione if harrys seen a grim thats thats bad he said my my uncle bilius saw one and and he died twenty four hours latercoincidence said hermione airily pouring herself some pumpkin juiceyou dont know what youre talking about said ron starting to get angry grims scare the living daylights out of most wizardsthere you are then said hermione in a superior tone they see the grim and die of fright the grims not an omen its the cause of deathand harrys still with us because hes not stupid enough to see one and think right well id better kick the bucket thenron mouthed wordlessly at hermione who opened her bag took out her new arithmancy book and propped it open against the juice jugi think divination seems very woolly she said searching for her page a lot of guesswork if you ask methere was nothing woolly about the grim in that cup said ron hotlyyou didnt seem quite so confident when you were telling harry it was asheep said hermione coollyprofessor trelawney said you didnt have the right aura you just dont like being bad at something for a changehe had touched a nerve hermione slammed her arithmancy book down on the table so hard that bits of meat and carrot flew everywhereif being good at divination means i have to pretend to see death omens in a lump of tea leaves im not sure ill be studying it much longerthat lesson was absolute rubbish compared with my arithmancy classshe snatched up her bag and stalked awayron frowned after herwhats she talking about he said to harry she hasnt been to an arithmancy class yetharry was pleased to get out of the castle after lunch yesterdays rain had cleared the sky was a clear pale gray and the grass was springy and damp underfoot as they set off for their first ever care of magical creatures classron and hermione werent speaking to each other harry walked beside them in silence as they went down the sloping lawns to hagrids hut on the edge of the forbidden forest it was only when he spotted three only too familiar backs ahead of them that he realized they must be having these lessons with the slytherins malfoy was talking animatedly to crabbe and goyle who were chortling harry was quite sure he knew what they were talking abouthagrid was waiting for his class at the door of his hut he stood in his moleskin overcoat with fang the boarhound at his heels looking impatient to startcmon now get a move on he called as the class approached got a real treat for yeh today great lesson comin up everyone here rightfollow mefor one nasty moment harry thought that hagrid was going to lead them into the forest harry had had enough unpleasant experiences in there to last him a lifetime however hagrid strolled off around the edge of the trees and five minutes later they found themselves outside a kind of paddock there was nothing in thereeveryone gather round the fence here he called thats it make sure yeh can see now firs thing yehll want ter do is open yer books how said the cold drawling voice of draco malfoyeh said hagridhow do we open our books malfoy repeated he took out his copy of the monster book of monsters which he had bound shut with a length of ropeother people took theirs out too some like harry had belted their book shut others had crammed them inside tight bags or clamped them together with binder clipshasn hasn anyone bin able ter open their books said hagridlooking crestfallenthe class all shook their headsyehve got ter stroke em said hagrid as though this was the most obvious thing in the world look he took hermiones copy and ripped off the spellotape that bound it the book tried to bite but hagrid ran a giant forefinger down its spineand the book shivered and then fell open and lay quiet in his handoh how silly weve all been malfoy sneered we should have stroked them why didnt we guessi i thought they were funny hagrid said uncertainly to hermioneoh tremendously funny said malfoy really witty giving us books that try and rip our hands offshut up malfoy said harry quietly hagrid was looking downcast and harry wanted hagrids first lesson to be a successrigh then said hagrid who seemed to have lost his thread so so yehve got yer books an an now yeh need the magical creaturesyeah so ill go an get em hang on he strode away from them into the forest and out of sightgod this place is going to the dogs said malfoy loudly that oaf teaching classes my fatherll have a fit when i tell him shut up malfoy harry repeatedcareful potter theres a dementor behind you oooooooh squealed lavender brown pointing toward the opposite side of the paddocktrotting toward them were a dozen of the most bizarre creatures harry had ever seen they had the bodies hind legs and tails of horses but the front legs wings and heads of what seemed to be giant eagles with cruel steel colored beaks and large brilliantly orange eyes the talons on their front legs were half a foot long and deadly lookingeach of the beasts had a thick leather collar around its neck which was attached to a long chain and the ends of all of these were held in the vast hands of hagrid who came jogging into the paddock behind the creaturesgee up there he roared shaking the chains and urging the creatures toward the fence where the class stood everyone drew back slightly as hagrid reached them and tethered the creatures to the fencehippogriffs hagrid roared happily waving a hand at them beauifularen theyharry could sort of see what hagrid meant once you got over the first shock of seeing something that was half horse half bird you started to appreciate the hippogriffs gleaming coats changing smoothly from feather to hair each of them a different color stormy gray bronzepinkish roan gleaming chestnut and inky blackso said hagrid rubbing his hands together and beaming around if yeh wan ter come a bit nearer no one seemed to want to harry ron and hermione however approached the fence cautiouslynow firs thing yeh gotta know abou hippogriffs is theyre proudsaid hagrid easily offended hippogriffs are dont never insult onecause it might be the last thing yeh domalfoy crabbe and goyle werent listening they were talking in an undertone and harry had a nasty feeling they were plotting how best to disrupt the lessonyeh always wait fer the hippogriff ter make the firs move hagrid continued its polite see yeh walk toward him and yeh bow an yeh wait if he bows back yehre allowed ter touch him if he doesn bowthen get away from him sharpish cause those talons hurtright who wants ter go firstmost of the class backed farther away in answer even harry ron and hermione had misgivings the hippogriffs were tossing their fierce heads and flexing their powerful wings they didnt seem to like being tethered like thisno one said hagrid with a pleading lookill do it said harrythere was an intake of breath from behind him and both lavender and parvati whispered oooh no harry remember your tea leavesharry ignored them he climbed over the paddock fencegood man harry roared hagrid right then lets see how yeh get on with buckbeakhe untied one of the chains pulled the gray hippogriff away from its fellows and slipped off its leather collar the class on the other side of the paddock seemed to be holding its breath malfoys eyes were narrowed maliciouslyeasy now harry said hagrid quietly yehve got eye contact now try not ter blink hippogriffs don trust yeh if yeh blink too muchharrys eyes immediately began to water but he didnt shut thernbuckbeak had turned his great sharp head and was staring at harry with one fierce orange eye thas it said hagrid thas it harry nowbowharry didnt feel much like exposing the back of his neck to buckbeakbut he did as he was told he gave a short bow and then looked upthe hippogriff was still staring haughtily at him it didnt moveah said hagrid sounding worried right back away now harryeasy does it but then to harrys enormous surprise the hippogriff suddenly bent its scaly front knees and sank into what was an unmistakable bowwell done harry said hagrid ecstatic right yeh can touch himpat his beak go onfeeling that a better reward would have been to back away harry moved slowly toward the hippogriff and reached out toward it he patted the beak several times and the hippogriff closed its eyes lazily as though enjoying itthe class broke into applause all except for malfoy crabbe and goylewho were looking deeply disappointedrigh then harry said hagrid i reckon he might let yeh ride himthis was more than harry had bargained for he was used to a broomstick but he wasnt sure a hippogriff would be quite the sameyeh climb up there jus behind the wing joint said hagrid an mind yeh don pull any of his feathers out he won like thatharry put his foot on the top of buckbeaks wing and hoisted himself onto its back buckbeak stood up harry wasnt sure where to hold on everything in front of him was covered with feathersgo on then roared hagrid slapping the hippogriffs hindquarterswithout warning twelve foot wings flapped open on either side of harryhe just had time to seize the hippogriff around the neck before he was soaring upward it was nothing like a broomstick and harry knew which one he preferred the hippogriffs wings beat uncomfortably on either side of him catching him under his legs and making him feel he was about to be thrown off the glossy feathers slipped under his fingers and he didnt dare get a stronger grip instead of the smooth action of his nimbus two thousand he now felt himself rocking backward and forward as the hindquarters of the hippogriff rose and fell with its wingsbuckbeak flew him once around the paddock and then headed back to the ground this was the bit harry had been dreading he leaned back as the smooth neck lowered feeling he was going to slip off over the beakthen felt a heavy thud as the four ill assorted feet hit the ground he just managed to hold on and push himself straight againgood work harry roared hagrid as everyone except malfoy crabbe and goyle cheered okay who else wants a goemboldened by harrys success the rest of the class climbed cautiously into the paddock hagrid untied the hippogriffs one by one and soon people were bowing nervously all over the paddock neville ran repeatedly backward from his which didnt seem to want to bend its knees ron and hermione practiced on the chestnut while harry watchedmalfoy crabbe and goyle had taken over buckbeak he had bowed to malfoy who was now patting his beak looking disdainfulthis is very easy malfoy drawled loud enough for harry to hear himi knew it must have been if potter could do it i bet youre not dangerous at all are you he said to the hippogriff are you you great ugly bruteit happened in a flash of steely talons malfoy let out a highpitched scream and next moment hagrid was wrestling buckbeak back into his collar as he strained to get at malfoy who lay curled in the grassblood blossoming over his robesim dying malfoy yelled as the class panicked im dying look at me its killed meyer not dyin said hagrid who had gone very white someone help me gotta get him outta here hermione ran to hold open the gate as hagrid lifted malfoy easily as they passed harry saw that there was a long deep gash on malfoys arm blood splattered the grass and hagrid ran with him up the slope toward the castlevery shaken the care of magical creatures class followed at a walk the slytherins were all shouting about hagridthey should fire him straight away said pansy parkinson who was in tearsit was malfoys fault snapped dean thomas crabbe and goyle flexed their muscles threateninglythey all climbed the stone steps into the deserted entrance hallim going to see if hes okay said pansy and they all watched her run up the marble staircase the slytherins still muttering about hagrid headed away in the direction of their dungeon common room harry ron and hermione proceeded upstairs to gryffindor toweryou think hell be all right said hermione nervouslycourse he will madam pomfrey can mend cuts in about a second said harry who had had far worse injuries mended magically by the nursethat was a really bad thing to happen in hagrids first class thoughwasnt it said ron looking worried trust malfoy to mess things up for himthey were among the first to reach the great hall at dinnertime hoping to see hagrid but he wasnt therethey wouldnt fire him would they said hermione anxiously not touching her steak and kidney puddingtheyd better not said ron who wasnt eating eitherharry was watching the slytherin table a large group including crabbe and goyle was huddled together deep in conversation harry was sure they were cooking up their own version of how malfoy had been injuredwell you cant say it wasnt an interesting first day back said ron gloomilythey went up to the crowded gryffindor common room after dinner and tried to do the homework professor mcgonagall had given them but all three of them kept breaking off and glancing out of the tower windowtheres a light on in hagrids window harry said suddenlyron looked at his watchif we hurried we could go down and see him its still quite earlyi dont know hermione said slowly and harry saw her glance at himim allowed to walk across the grounds he said pointedly sirius black hasnt got past the dementors yet has heso they put their things away and headed out of the portrait hole glad to meet nobody on their way to the front doors as they werent entirely sure they were supposed to be outthe grass was still wet and looked almost black in the twilight whenthey reached hagrids hut they knocked and a voice growled cminhagrid was sitting in his shirtsleeves at his scrubbed wooden table his boarhound fang had his head in hagrids lap one look told them that hagrid had been drinking a lot there was a pewter tankard almost as big as a bucket in front of him and he seemed to be having difficulty getting them into focusspect its a record he said thickly when he recognized them don reckon theyve ever had a teacher who lasted ony a day beforeyou havent been fired hagrid gasped hermionenot yet said hagrid miserably taking a huge gulp of whatever was in the tankard buts only a matter o time i nt it after malfoyhow is he said ron as they all sat

beetle black eyeshe grabbed both harry and ron and pulled them into a bone breaking hugi think youve had enough to drink hagrid said hermione firmly she took the tankard from the table and went outside to empty itat maybe shes right said hagrid letting go of harry and ron who both staggered away rubbing their ribs hagrid heaved himself out of his chair and followed hermione unsteadily outside they heard a loud splashwhats he done said harry nervously as hermione came back in with the empty tankardstuck his head in the water barrel said hermione putting the tankard awayhagrid came back his long hair and beard sopping wet wiping the water out of his eyesthats better he said shaking his head like a dog and drenching them all listen it was good of yeh ter come an see me i really hagrid stopped dead staring at harry as though hed only just realized he was therewhat dyeh think youre doin eh he roared so suddenly that they jumped a foot in the air yehre not to go wanderin around after darkharry an you two lettin himhagrid strode over to harry grabbed his arm and pulled him to the doorcmon hagrid said angrily im takin yer all back up ter schoolan don let me catch yeh walkin down ter see me after dark again im not worth thatchapter seven the boggart in the wardrobemalfoy didnt reappear in classes until late on thursday morning when the slytherins and gryffindors were halfway through double potions he swaggered into the dungeon his right arm covered in bandages and bound up in a sling acting in harrys opinion as though he were the heroic survivor of some dreadful battlehow is it draco simpered pansy parkinson does it hurt muchyeah said malfoy putting on a brave sort of grimace but harry saw him wink at crabbe and goyle when pansy had looked awaysettle down settle down said professor snape idlyharry and ron scowled at each other snape wouldnt have said settle down if theyd walked in late hed have given them detention but malfoy had always been able to get away with anything in snapes classes snape was head of slytherin house and generality favored his own students above all othersthey were making a new potion today a shrinking solution malfoy set up his cauldron right next to harry and ron so that they were preparing their ingredients on the same tablesir malfoy called sir ill need help cutting up these daisy rootsbecause of my arm weasley cut up malfoys roots for him said snape without looking upron went brick redtheres nothing wrong with your arm he hissed at malfoymalfoy smirked across the tableweasley you heard professor snape cut up these rootsron seized his knife pulled malfoys roots toward him and began to chop them roughly so that they were all different sizesprofessor drawled malfoy weasleys mutilating my roots sitsnape approached their table stared down his hooked nose at the rootsthen gave ron an unpleasant smile from beneath his long greasy black hairchange roots with malfoy weasleybut sit ron had spent the last quarter of an hour carefully shredding his own roots into exactly equal piecesnow said snape in his most dangerous voiceron shoved his own beautifully cut roots across the table a malfoythen took up the knife againand sir ill need this shrivelfig skinned said malfoy his voice full of malicious laughterpotter you can skin malfoys shrivelfig said snape giving harry the look of loathing he always reserved just for himharry took malfoys shrivelfig as ron began trying to repair the damage to the roots he now had to use harry skinned the shrivelfig as fast as he could and flung it back across the table at malfoy without speakingmalfoy was smirking more broadly than everseen your pal hagrid lately he asked them quietlynone of your business said ron jerkily without looking upim afraid he wont be a teacher much longer said malfoy in a tone of mock sorrow fathers not very happy about my injury keep talking malfoy and ill give you a real injury snarled ronhes complained to the school governors and to the ministry of magic fathers got a lot of influence you know and a lasting injury like this he gave a huge fake sigh who knows if my armll everbe the same againso thats why youre putting it on said harry accidentally beheading a dead caterpillar because his hand was shaking in anger to try to get hagrid firedwell said malfoy lowering his voice to a whisper partly potterbut there are other benefits too weasley slice my caterpillars for mea few cauldrons away neville was in trouble neville regularly went to pieces in potions lessons it was his worst subject and his great fear of professor snape made things ten times worse his potion which was supposed to be a bright acid green had turned orange longbottom said snape ladling some up and allowing to splash back into the cauldron so that everyone could seeorange tell me boy does anything penetrate that thick skull of yours didnt you hear me say quite clearly that only one tat spleen was needed didnt i state plainly that a dash of leech juice would suffice what do i have to do to make you understand longbottomneville was pink and trembling he looked as though he was on the verge of tearsplease sir said hermione please i could help neville put it right i dont remember asking you to show off miss granger said snape coldly and hermione went as pink as neville longbottom at the end of this lesson we will feed a few drops of this potion to your toad and see what happens perhaps that will encourage you to do it properlysnape moved away leaving neville breathless with fearhelp me he moaned to hermionehey harry said seamus finnigan leaning over to borrow harrys brass scales have you heard daily prophet this morning they reckonsirius blacks been sightedwhere said harry and ron quickly on the other side of the tablemalfoy looked up listening closelynot too far from here said seamus who looked excited it was a muggle who saw him course she didnt really understand the muggles think hes just an ordinary criminal dont they so she phoned the telephone hot line by the time the ministry of magic got there he was gonenot too far from here ron repeated looking significantly at harry he turned around and saw malfoy watching closely what malfoyneed something else skinnedbut malfoys eyes were shining malevolently and they were fixed harryhe leaned across the tableblack single handed potterthinking of trying to catch yeah thats right said harry offhandedlymalfoys thin mouth was curving in a mean smileof course if it was me he said quietly id have done something before now i wouldnt be staying in school like a good boy id be out there looking for himwhat are you talking about malfoy said ron roughlydont you know potter breathed malfoy his pate eyes narrowedknow whatmalfoy let out a low sneering laughmaybe youd rather not risk your neck he said want to leave it to the dementors do you but if it was me id want revenge id hunt himdown myselfwhat are you talking about said harry angrily but at that moment snape called you should have finished adding your ingredients by now this potion needs to stew before it can be drunk so clear away while it simmers and then well test longbottoms crabbe and goyle laughed openly watching neville sweat as he stirred his potion feverishly hermione was muttering instructions to him out of the corner of her mouth so that snape wouldnt see harry and ron packed away their unused ingredients and went to wash their hands and ladles in the stone basin in the cornerwhat did malfoy mean harry muttered to ron as he stuck his hands under the icy jet that poured from the gargoyles mouth why would i want revenge on black he hasnt done anything to me yethes making it up said ron savagely hes trying to make you do something stupidthe end of the lesson in sight snape strode over to neville who was cowering by his cauldroneveryone gather round said snape his black eyes glittering and watch what happens to longbottoms toad if he has managed to produce a shrinking solution it will shrink to a tadpole if as i dont doubthe has done it wrong his toad is likely to be poisonedthe gryffindors watched fearfully the slytherins looked excited snape picked up trevor the toad in his left hand and dipped a small spoon into nevilles potion which was now green he trickled a few drops down trevors throatthere was a moment of hushed silence in which trevor gulped then there was a small pop and trevor the tadpole was wriggling in snapes palmthe gryffindors burst into applause snape looking sour pulled a small bottle from the pocket of his robe poured a few drops on top of trevorand he reappeared suddenly fully grownfive points from gryffindor said snape which wiped the smiles from every face i told you not to help him miss granger class dismissedharry ron and hermione climbed the steps to the entrance hall harry was still thinking about what malfoy had said while ron was seething about snapefive points from gryffindor because the potion was all rightwhy didnt you lie hermione you shouldve said neville did it all by himselfhermione didnt answer ron looked aroundwhere is sheharry turned too they were at the top of the steps now watching the rest of the class pass them heading for the great hall and lunchshe was right behind us said ron frowningmalfoy passed them walking between crabbe and goyle he smirked at harry and disappearedthere she is said harryhermione was panting slightly hurrying up the stairs one hand clutched her bag the other seemed to be tucking something down the front of her robeshow did you do that said ronwhat said hermione joining themone minute you were right behind us the next moment you were back at the bottom of the stairs againwhat hermione looked slightly confused oh i had to go back for something oh no a seam had split on hermiones bag harry wasnt surprised he could see that it was crammed with at least a dozen large and heavy bookswhy are you carrying all these around with you ron asked heryou know how many subjects im taking said hermione breathlesslycouldnt hold these for me could youbut ron was turning over the books she had handed him looking at the covers you havent got any of these subjects today its only defense against the dark arts this afternoonoh yes said hermione vaguely but she packed all the books back into her bag just the same i hope theres something good for lunch im starving she added and she marched off toward the great halldyou get the feeling hermiones not telling us somethingron asked harryprofessor lupin wasnt there when they arrived at his first defense against the dark arts lesson they all sat down took out their booksquills and parchment and were talking when he finally entered the room lupin smiled vaguely and placed his tatty old briefcase on the teachers desk he was as shabby as ever but looked healthier than he had on the train as though he had had a few square mealsgood afternoon he said would you please put all your books back in your bags todays will be a practical lesson you will need only your wandsa few curious looks were exchanged as the class put away their booksthey had never had a practical defense against the dark arts beforeunless you counted the memorable class last year when their old teacher had brought a cageful of pixies to class and set them looseright then said professor lupin when everyone was ready if youd follow mepuzzled but interested the class got to its feet and followed professor lupin out of the classroom he led them along the deserted corridor andaround a corner where the first thing they saw was peeves the poltergeist who was floating upside down in midair and stuffing the nearest keyhole with chewing gumpeeves didnt look up until professor lupin was two feet away hen he wiggled his curly toed feet and broke into songloony loopy lupin peeves sang loony loopy lupin loony loopy lupin rude and unmanageable as he almost always was peeves usually showed some respect toward the teachers everyone looked quickly at professor lupin to see how he would take this to their surprise he was still smilingid take that gum out of the keyhole if i were you peeves he said pleasantly mr filch wont be able to get in to his broomsfilch was the hogwarts caretaker a bad tempered failed wizard who waged a constant war against the students and indeed peeves howeverpeeves paid no attention to professor lupins words except to blow a loud wet raspberryprofessor lupin gave a small sigh and took out his wandthis is a useful little spell he told the class over his shoulderplease watch closelyhe raised the wand to shoulder height said waddiwasi and pointed it at peeveswith the force of a bullet the wad of chewing gum shot out of the keyhole and straight down peevess left nostril he whirled upright and zoomed away cursingcool sit said dean thomas in amazementthank you dean said professor lupin putting his wand away againshall we proceedthey set off again the class looking at shabby professor lupin with increased respect he led them down a second corridor and stopped right outside the staffroom doorinside please said professor lupin opening it and standing backthe staffroom a long paneled room full of old mismatched chairs was empty except for one teacher professor snape was sitting in a low armchair and he looked around as the class filed in his eyes were glittering and there was a nasty sneer playing around his mouth as professor lupin came in and made to close the door behind him snape said leave it open lupin id rather not witness thishe got to his feet and strode past the class his black robes billowing behind him at the doorway he turned on his heel and said possibly no ones warned you lupin but this class contains neville longbottom i would advise you not to entrust him with anything difficult not unless miss granger is hissing instructions in his earneville went scarlet harry glared at snape it was bad enough that he bullied neville in his own classes let alone doing it in front of other teachersprofessor lupin had raised his eyebrowsi was hoping that neville would assist me with the first stage of the operation he said and i am sure he will perform it admirablynevilles face went if possible even redder snapes lip curled but he left shutting the door with a snapnow then said professor lupin beckoning the class toward the end of the room where there was nothing but an old wardrobe where the teachers kept their spare robes as professor lupin went to stand next to it the wardrobe gave a sudden wobble banging off the wallnothing to worry about said professor lupin calmly because a few people had jumped backward in alarm theres a boggart in theremost people seemed to feel that this was something to worry aboutneville gave professor lupin a look of pure terror and seamus finnigan eyed the now rattling doorknob apprehensivelyboggarts like dark enclosed spaces said professor lupin wardrobesthe gap beneath beds the cupboards under sinks ive even met one that had lodged itself in a grandfather clock this one moved in yesterday afternoon and i asked the headmaster if the staff would leave it to give my third years some practiceso the first question we must ask ourselves is what is a boggarthermione put up her handits a shape shifter she said it can take the shape of whatever it thinks will frighten us mostcouldnt have put it better myself said professor lupin and hermione glowed so the boggart sitting in the darkness within has not yet assumed a form he does not yet know what will frighten the person on the other side of the door nobody knows what a boggart looks like when he is alone but when i let him out he will immediately become whatever each of us most fearsthis means said professor lupin choosing to ignore nevilles mall sputter of terror that we have a huge advantage over the boggart before we begin have you spotted it harrytrying to answer a question with hermione next to him bobbing up and down on the balls of her feet with her hand in the air was very off putting but harry had a goer because there are so many of us it wont know what shape it should beprecisely said professor lupin and hermione put her hand downlooking a little disappointed its always best to have com pany when youre dealing with a boggart he becomes confused which should he become a headless corpse or a flesh eating slug i once saw a boggart make that very mistake tried to frighten two people at once and turned himself into half a slug not remotely frighteningthe charm that repels a boggart is simple yet it requires force of mind you see the thing that really finishes a boggart is laughterwhat you need to do is force it to assume a shape that you find amusingwe will practice the charm without wands first after me please riddikulusriddikulus said the class togethergood said professor lupin very good but that was the easy partim afraid you see the word alone is not enough and this is where you come in nevillethe wardrobe shook again though not as much as neville who walked forward as though he were heading for the gallowsright neville said professor lupin first things first what would you say is the thing that frightens you most in the worldnevilles lips moved but no noise came outdidnt catch that neville sorry said professor lupin cheerfullyneville looked around rather wildly as though begging someone to help him then said in barely more than a whisper professor snapenearly everyone laughed even neville grinned apologetically professor lupin however looked thoughtfulprofessor snape hmmm neville i believe you live with your grandmotherer yes said neville nervously but i dont want the boggart to turn into her eitherno no you misunderstand me said professor lupin now smiling i wonder could you tell us what sort of clothes your grandmother usually wearsneville looked startled but said well always the same hat a tall one with a stuffed vulture on top and a long dress greennormally and sometimes a fox fur scarfand a handbag prompted professor lupina big red one said nevilleright then said professor lupin can you picture those clothes very clearly neville can you see them in your minds eyeyes said neville uncertainty plainly wondering what was coming nextwhen the boggart bursts out of this wardrobe neville and sees you it will assume the form of professor snape said lupin and you will raise your wand thus and cry riddikulus and concentrate hard on your grandmothers clothes if all goes well professor boggart snape will be forced into that vulture topped hat and that green dress with that big red handbagthere was a great shout of laughter the wardrobe wobbled more violentlyif neville is successful the boggart is likely to shift his attention to each of us in turn said professor lupin i would like all of you to take a moment now to think of the thing that scares you most and imagine how you might force it to look comicalthe room went quiet harry thought what scared him most in the worldhis first thought was lord voldemort a voldemort returned to full strength but before he had even started to plan a possible counterattack on a boggart voldemort a horrible image came floating to the surface of his minda rotting glistening hand slithering back beneath a black cloak a long rattling breath from an unseen mouth then a cold so penetrating it felt like drowningharry shivered then looked around hoping no one had noticed many people had their eyes shut tight ron was muttering to himself take its legs off harry was sure he knew what that was about rons greatest fear was spiderseveryone ready said professor lupinharry felt a lurch of fear he wasnt ready how could you make a dementor less frightening but he didnt want to ask for more time everyone else was nodding and rolling up their sleevesneville were going to back away said professor lupin let you have a clear field all right ill call the next person forward everyone back now so neville can get a clear shot they all retreated backed against the walls leaving neville alone beside the wardrobe he looked pale and frightened but he had pushed up the sleeves of his robes and was holding his wand readyon the count of three neville said professor lupin who was pointing his own wand at the handle of the wardrobe one two three nowa jet of sparks shot from the end of professor lupins wand and hit the doorknob the wardrobe burst open hook nosed and menacing professor snape stepped out his eyes flashing at nevilleneville backed away his wand up mouthing wordlessly snape was bearing down upon him reaching inside his robesr r riddikulus squeaked nevillethere was a noise like a whip crack snape stumbled he was wearing a long lace trimmed dress and a towering hat topped with a moth eaten vulture and he was swinging a huge crimson handbagthere was a roar of laughter the boggart paused confused and professor lupin shouted parvati forwardparvati walked forward her face set snape rounded on her there was another crack and where he had stood was a bloodstained bandaged mummy its sightless face was turned to parvati and it began to walk toward her very slowly dragging its feet its stiff arms rising riddikulus cried parvatia bandage unraveled at the mummys feet it became entangled fell face forward and its head rolled offseamus roared professor lupinseamus darted past parvaticrack where the mummy had been was a woman with floorlength black hair and a skeletal green tinged face a banshee she opened her mouth wide and an unearthly sound filled the room a long wailing shriek that made the hair on harrys head stand on end riddikulus shouted seamusthe banshee made a rasping noise and clutched her throat her voice was gonecrack the banshee turned into a rat which chased its tail in a circlethen crack became a rattlesnake which slithered and writhed before crack becoming a single bloody eyeballits confused shouted lupin were getting there deandean hurried forwardcrack the eyeball became a severed hand which flipped over and began to creep along the floor like a crabriddikulus yelled deanthere was a snap and the hand was trapped in a mousetrapexcellent ron you nextron leapt forwardcrackquite a few people screamed a giant spider six feet tall and covered in hair was advancing on ron clicking its pincers menacingly for a moment harry thought ron had frozen then riddikulus bellowed ron and the spiders legs vanished it rolled over and over lavender brown squealed and ran out of its way and it came to a halt at harrys feet he raised his wand ready but here shouted professor lupin suddenly hurrying forward crackthe legless spider had vanished for a second everyone looked wildly around to see where it was then they saw a silvery white orb hanging in the air in front of lupin who said riddikulus almosi lazilycrackforward neville and finish him off said lupin as the boggart landed on the floor as a cockroach crack snape was back this time neville charged forward looking determinedriddikulus he shouted and they had a split seconds view of snape in his lacy dress before neville let out a great ha of laughter and the boggart exploded burst into a thousand tiny wisps of smoke and was goneexcellent cried professor lupin as the class broke into applauseexcellent neville well done everyone let me see five points to gryffindor for every person to tackle the boggart ten for neville because he did it twice and five each to hermione and harrybut i didnt do anything said harryyou and hermione answered my questions correctly at the start of the class harry lupin said lightly very well everyone an excellent lesson homework kindly read the chapter on boggarts and summarize it for me to be handed in on monday that will be alltalking excitedly the class left the staffroom harry however wasnt feeling cheerful professor lupin had deliberately stopped him from tackling the boggart why was it because hed seen harry collapse on the train and thought he wasnt up to much had he thought harry would pass out againbut no one else seemed to have noticed anythingdid you see me take that banshee shouted seamus and the hand said dean waving his own aroundand snape in that hat and my mummyi wonder why professor lupins frightened of crystal balls said lavender thoughtfullythat was the best defense against the dark arts lesson weve ever hadwasnt it said ron excitedly as they made their way back to the classroom to get their bagshe seems like a very good teacher said hermione approvingly but i wish i could have had a turn with the boggart what would it have been for you said ron sniggering a piece of homework that only got nine out of tenchapter eight flight of the fat fadyin no time at all defense against the dark arts had become most peoples favorite class only draco malfoy and his gang of slytherins had anything bad to say about professor lupinlook at the state of his robes malfoy would say in a loud whisper as professor lupin passed he dresses like our old houseelf but no one else cared that professor lupins robes were patched and frayed his next few lessons were just as interesting as the firstafter boggarts they studied red caps nasty little goblin like creatures that lurked wherever there had been bloodshed in the dungeons of castles and the potholes of deserted battlefields waiting to bludgeon those who had gotten lost from red caps they moved on to kappas creepy water dwellers that looked like scaly monkeys with webbed hands itching to strangle unwitting waders in their pondsharry only wished he was as happy with some of his other classes worst of all was potions snape was in a particularly vindictive mood these days and no one was in any doubt why the story of the boggart assuming snapes shape and the way that neville had dressed it in his grandmothers clothes had traveled through the school like wildfiresnape didnt seem to find it funny his eyes flashed menacingly at the very mention of professor lupins name and he was bullying neville worse than everharry was also growing to dread the hours he spent in professor trelawneys stifling tower room deciphering lopsided shapes and symbols trying to ignore the way professor trelawneys enormous eyes filled with tears every time she looked at him he couldnt like professer trelawney even though she was treated with respect bordering on reverence by many of the class parvati patil and lavender brown had taken to haunting professor trelawneys tower room at lunch times and always returned with annoyingly superior looks on their faces as though they knew things the others didnt they had also started using hushed voices whenever they spoke to harry as though he were on his deathbednobody really liked care of magical creatures which after the action packed first class had become extremely dull hagrid seemed to have lost his confidence they were now spending lesson after lesson learning how to look after flobberworms which had to be some of the most boring creatures in existencewhy would anyone bother looking after them said ron after yet another hour of poking shredded lettuce down the flobberworms throatsat the start of october however harry had something else to occupy him something so enjoyable it more than made up for his unsatisfactory classes the quidditch season was approaching and oiver wood captain of the gryffindor team called a meeting on thursday evening to discusstactics for the new seasonthere were seven people on a quidditch team three chasers whose job it was to score goals by putting the quaffle a red soccer sized ball through one of the fifty foot high hoops at each end of the field two beaters who were equipped with heavy bats to repel the bludgers two heavy black balls that zoomed around trying to attack the players a keeper who defended the goal posts and the seeker who had the hardest job of all that of catching the golden snitch a tiny winged walnut sized ball whose capture ended the game and earned the seekers team an extra one hundred and fifty pointsoliver wood was a burly seventeen year old now in his seventh and final year at hogwarts there was a quiet sort of desperation in his voice as he addressed his six fellow team members in the chilly locker rooms on the edge of the darkening quidditch fieldthis is our last chance my last chance to win the quidditch cuphe told them striding up and down in front of them ill be leaving at the end of this year ill never get another shot at itgryffindor hasnt won for seven years now okay so weve had the worst luck in the world injuries then the tournamentgetting called off last year wood swallowed as though the memory still brought a lump to his throat but we also know weve got the best ruddy team in the school he said punching a fist into his other hand the old manic glint back in his eye weve got three superb chaserswood pointed at alicia spinner angelina johnson and katie bellweve got two unbeatable beatersstop it oliver youre embarrassing us said fred and george weasley together pretending to blushand weve got a seeker who has never failed to win us a match woodrumbled glaring at harry with a kind of furious pride and me he added as an afterthoughtwe think youre very good too oliver said georgespanking good keeper said fredthe point is wood went on resuming his pacing the quidditch cup should have had our name on it these last two years ever since harry joined the team ive thought the thing was in the bag but we havent got it and this years the last chance well get to finally see our name on the thingwood spoke so dejectedly that even fred and george looked sympatheticoliver this years our year said fredwell do it oliver said angelinadefinitely said harryfull of determination the team started training sessions three evenings a week the weather was getting colder and wetter the nights darker but no amount of mud wind or rain could tarnish harrys wonderful vision of finally winning the huge silver quidditch cupharry returned to the gryffindor common room one evening after trainingcold and stiff but pleased with the way practice had gone to find the room buzzing excitedlywhats happened he asked ron and hermione who were sitting in two of the best chairs by the fireside and completing some star charts for astronomyfirst hogsmeade weekend said ron pointing at a notice that had appeared on the battered old bulletin board end of octoberhalloweenexcellent said fred who had followed harry through the portrait hole i need to visit zonkos im nearly out of stink pelletsharry threw himself into a chair beside ron his high spirits ebbing away hermione seemed to read his mindharry im sure youll be able to go next time she said theyre bound to catch black soon hes been sighted once alreadyblacks not fool enough to try anything in hogsmeade said ron ask mcgonagall if you can go this time harry the next one might not be for ages ron said hermione harrys supposed to stay in school he cant be the only third year left behind said ron ask mcgonagall go on harry yeah i think i will said harry making up his mindhermione opened her mouth to argue but at that moment crookshanks leapt lightly onto her lap a large dead spider was dangling from his mouthdoes he have to eat that in front of us said ron scowlingclever crookshanks did you catch that all by yourself said hermionecrookshanks slowly chewed up the spider his yellow eyes fixed insolently on ronjust keep him over there thats all said ron irritably turning back to his star chart ve got scabbers asleep in my bagharry yawned he really wanted to go to bed but he still had his own star chart to complete he pulled his bag toward him took out parchment ink and quill and started workyou can copy mine if you like said ron labeling his last star with a flourish and shoving the chart toward harryhermione who disapproved of copying pursed her lips but didnt say anything crookshanks was still staring unblinkingly at ron flickingthe end of his bushy tail then without warning he pouncedoy ron roared seizing his bag as crookshanks sank four sets of claws deep inside it and began tearing ferociously get off you stupid animalron tried to pull the bag away from crookshanks but crookshanks clung on spitting and slashingron dont hurt him squealed hermione the whole common room was watching ron whirled the bag around crookshanks still clinging to itand scabbers came flying out of the top catch that car ron yelled as crookshanks freed himself from the remnants of the bag sprang over the table and chased after the terrified scabbersgeorge weasley made a lunge for crookshanks but missed scabbers streaked through twenty pairs of legs and shot beneath an old chest of drawers crookshanks skidded to a halt crouched low on his bandy legsand started making furious swipes beneath it with his front pawron and hermione hurried over hermione grabbed crookshanks around the middle and heaved him away ron threw himself onto his stomach and with great difficulty pulled scabbers out by the taillook at him he said furiously to hermione dangling scabbers in front of her hes skin and bone you keep that cat away from himcrookshanks doesnt understand its wrong said hermione her voice shaking all cats chase rats rontheres something funny about that animal said ron who was trying to persuade a frantically wiggling scabbers back into his pocket it heard me say that scabbers was in my bagoh what rubbish said hermione impatiently crookshanks could smell him ron how else dyou think that cats got it in for scabbers said ron ignoring the peoplearound him who were starting to giggle and scabbers was here firstand hes illron marched through the common room and out of sight up the stairs to the boys dormitoriesron was still in a bad mood with hermione next day he barely talked to her all through herbology even though he harry and hermione were working together on the same puffapodhows scabbers hermione asked timidly as they stripped fat pink pods from the plants and emptied the shining beans into a wooden pailhes hiding at the bottom of my bed shaking said ron angrilymissing the pail and scattering beans over the greenhouse floorcareful weasley careful cried professor sprout as the beans burst into bloom before their very eyesthey had transfiguration next harry who had resolved to ask professor mcgonagall after the lesson whether he could go into hogsmeade with the rest joined the line outside the class trying to decide how he was going to argue his case he was distracted however by a disturbance at the front of the linelavender brown seemed to be crying parvati had her arm around her and was explaining something to seamus finnigan and dean thomas who were looking very seriouswhats the matter lavender said hermione anxiously as she harryand ron went to join the groupshe got a letter from home this morning parvati whispered its her rabbit binky hes been killed by a foxoh said hermione im sorry lavenderi should have known said lavender tragically you know what day it iser the sixteenth of october that thing youre dreading it will happen on the sixteenth of october remember she was right she was rightthe whole class was gathered around lavender now seamus shook his head seriously hermione hesitated then she said you you were dreading binky being killed by a foxwell not necessarily by a fox said lavender looking up at hermione with streaming eyes but i was obviously dreading him dying wasnt loh said hermione she paused again then was binky an old rabbitn no sobbed lavender h he was only a babyparvati tightened her arm around lavenders shouldersbut then why would you dread him dying said hermioneparvati glared at herwell look at it logically said hermione turning to the rest of the group i mean binky didnt even die today did he lavender just got the news today lavender wailed loudly and she cant have been dreading it because its come as a real shock dont mind hermione lavender said ron loudly she doesnt think other peoples pets matter very muchprofessor mcgonagall opened the classroom door at that moment which was perhaps lucky hermione and ron were looking daggers at each other and when they got into class they seated themselves on either side of harry and didnt talk to each other for the whole classharry still hadnt decided what he was going to say to professor mcgonagall when the bell rang at the end of the lesson but it was she who brought up the subject of hogsmeade firstone moment please she called as the class made to leave as youre all in my house you should hand hogsmeade permission forms to me before halloween no form no visiting the village so dont forgetneville put up his handplease professor i i think ive lost your grandmother sent yours to me directly longbottom said professor mcgonagall she seemed to think it was safer well thats all you may leaveask her now ron hissed at harryoh but hermione begango for it harry said ron stubbornlyharry waited for the rest of the class to disappear then headed nervously for professor mcgonagalls deskyes potter harry took a deep breathprofessor my aunt and uncle er forgot to sign my form he saidprofessor mcgonagall looked over her square spectacles at him but didnt say anythingso er dyou think it would be all right mean will it be okay if i if i go to hogsmeadeprofessor mcgonagall looked down and began shuffling papers on her deskim afraid not potter she said you heard what i said no form no visiting the village thats the rulebut professor my aunt and uncle you know theyre muggles they dont really understand about about hogwarts forms and stuff harry said while ron egged him on with vigorous nods if you said i could gobut i dont say so said professor mcgonagall standing up and piling her papers neatly into a drawer the form clearly states that the parent or guardian must give permission she turned to look at himwith an odd expression on her face was it pity im sorry potter but thats my final word you had better hurry or youll be late for your next lessonthere was nothing to be done ron called professor mcgonagall a lot of names that greatly annoyed hermione hermione assumed an all for the best expression that made ron even angrier and harry had to endure everyone in the class talking loudly and happily about what they were going to do first once they got into hogsmeadetheres always the feast said ron in an effort to cheer harry upyou know the halloween feast in the eveningyeah said harry gloomily greatthe halloween feast was always good but it would taste a lot better if he was coming to it after a day in hogsmeade with everyone else nothing anyone said made him feel any better about being left behind dean thomas who was good with a quill had offered to forge uncle vernons signature on the form but as harry had already told professor mcgonagall he hadnt had it signed that was no good ron halfheartedly suggested the invisibility cloak but hermione stamped on that onereminding ron what dumbledore had told them about the dementors being able to see through them percy had what were possibly the least helpful words of comfortthey make a fuss about hogsmeade but i assure you harry its not all its cracked up to be he said seriously all right the sweetshops rather good and zonkos joke shops frankly dangerous and yes the shrieking shacks always worth a visit but really harry apart from that youre not missing anythingon halloween morning harry awoke with the rest and went down to breakfast feeling thoroughly depressed though doing his best to act normallywell bring you lots of sweets back from honeydukes said hermionelooking desperately sorry for himyeah loads said ron he and hermione had finally forgotten their squabble about crookshanks in the face of harrys difficultiesdont worry about me said harry in what he hoped was at offhand voice ill see you at the feast have a good timehe accompanied them to the entrance hall where filch the caretakerwas standing inside the front doors checking off names against a long list peering suspiciously into every face and making sure that no one was sneaking out who shouldnt be goingstaying here potter shouted malfoy who was standing in line with crabbe and goyle scared of passing the dementorsharry ignored him and made his solitary way up the marble staircasethrough the deserted corridors and back to gryffindor towerpassword said the fat lady jerking out of a dozefortuna major said harry listlesslythe portrait swung open and he climbed through the hole into the common room it was full of chattering first and second years and a few older students who had obviously visited hogsmeade so often the novelty had worn off harry harry hi harryit was colin creevey a second year who was deeply in awe of harry and never missed an opportunity to speak to himarent you going to hogsmeade harry why not hey colin looked eagerly around at his friends you can come and sit with us if you like harryer no thanks colin said harry who wasnt in the mood to have alot of people staring avidly at the scar on his forehead i ive got to go to the library got to get some work doneafter that he had no choice but to turn right around and head back out of the portrait hole againwhat was the point waking me up the fat lady called grumpily after him as he walked awayharry wandered dispiritedly toward the library but halfway there he changed his mind he didnt feel like working he turned around and came face to face with filch who had obviously just seen off the last of the hogsmeade visitorswhat are you doing filch snarled suspiciouslynothing said harry truthfullynothing spat filch his jowls quivering unpleasantly a likely story sneaking around on your own why arent you in hogsmeade buying stink pellets and belch powder and whizzing worms like the rest of your nasty little friendsharry shruggedwell get back to your common room where you belong snapped filchand he stood glaring until harry had passed out of sightbut harry didnt go back to the common room he climbed a staircasethinking vaguely of visiting the owlery to see hedwig and was walking along another corridor when a voice from inside one of the rooms saidharryharry doubled back to see who had spoken and met professor lupinlooking around his office doorwhat are you doing said lupin though in a very different voice from filch where are ron and hermionehogsmeade said harry in a would be casual voiceah said lupin he considered harry for a moment why dont you come in ive just taken delivery of a grindylow for our next lesson a what said harry i he followed lupin into his office in the corner stood a very large tank of water a sickly green creature with sharp little horns had its face pressed against the glass pulling faces and flexing its long spindly fingerswater demon said lupin surveying the grindylow thoughtfully we shouldnt have much difficulty with him not after the kappas the trick is to break his grip you notice the abnormally long fingers strongbut very brittlethe grindylow bared its green teeth and then buried itself in a tangle of weeds in a cornercup of tea lupin said looking around for his kettle i was just thinking of making oneall right said harry awkwardlylupin tapped the kettle with his wand and a blast of steam issued suddenly from the spoutsit down said lupin taking the lid off a dusty tin ive only got teabags im afraid but i daresay youve had enough of tea leavesharry looked at him lupins eyes were twinklinghow did you know about that harry askedprofessor mcgonagall told me said lupin passing harry a chipped mug of tea youre not worried are youno said harryhe thought for a moment of telling lupin about the dog hed seen in magnolia crescent but decided not to he didnt want lupin to think hewas a coward especially since lupin alreadv seemed to think he couldnt cope with a boggartsomething of harrys thoughts seemed to have shown on his face because lupin said anything worrying you harryno harry lied he drank a bit of tea and watched the grindylow brandishing a fist at him yes he said suddenly putting his tea down on lupins desk you know that day we fought the boggartyes said lupin slowlywhy didnt you let me fight it said harry abruptlylupin raised his eyebrowsi would have thought that was obvious harry he said sounding surprisedharry who had expected lupin to deny that hed done any such thing was taken abackwhy he said againwell said lupin frowning slightly i assumed that if the boggart faced you it would assume the shape of lord voldemortharry stared not only was this the last answer hed expected but lupin had said voldemorts name the only person harry had ever heard say the name aloud apart from himself was professor dumbledoreclearly i was wrong said lupin still frowning at harry but i didnt think it a good idea for lord voldemort to materialize in the staffroom i imagined that people would panici didnt think of voldemort said harry honestly i i remembered those dementorsi see said lupin thoughtfully well well im impressed fie smiled slightly at the look of surprise on harrys face that suggeststhat what you fear most of all is fear very wise harryharry didnt know what to say to that so he drank some mot teaso youve been thinking that i didnt believe you capable of fighting the boggart said lupin shrewdlywell yeah said harry he was suddenly feeling a lot happierprofessor lupin you know the dementors he was interrupted by a knock on the doorcome in called lupinthe door opened and in came snape he was carrying a goblet which was smoking faintly and stopped at the sight of harry his black eyes narrowingah severus said lupin smiling thanks very much could you leave it here on the desk for mesnape set down the smoking goblet his eyes wandering between harry and lupini was just showing harry my grindylow said lupin pleasantly pointing at the tankfascinating said snape without looking at it you should drink that directly lupinyes yes i will said lupini made an entire cauldronful snape continued if you need morei should probably take some again tomorrow thanks very much severusnot at all said snape but there was a look in his eye harry didnt like he backed out of the room unsmiling and watchfulharry looked curiously at the goblet lupin smiledprofessor snape has very kindly concocted a potion for me he said i have never been much of a potion brewer and this one is particularly complex he picked up the goblet and sniffed it pity sugar makes it useless he added taking a sip and shudderingwhy harry began lupin looked at him and answered the unfinished questionive been feeling a bit off color he said this potion is the only thing that helps i am very lucky to be working alongside professor snape there arent many wizards who are up to making itprofessor lupin took another sip and harry had a crazy urge to knock the goblet out of his handsprofessor snapes very interested in the dark arts he blurted outreally said lupin looking only mildly interested as he took another gulp of potionsome people reckon harry hesitated then plunged recklessly onsome people reckon hed do anything to get the defense against the dark arts joblupin drained the goblet and pulled a facedisgusting he said well harry id better get back to work see you at the feast laterright said harry putting down his empty teacupthe empty goblet was still smokingthere you go said ron we got as much as we could carrya shower of brilliantly colored sweets fell into harrys lap it was dusk and ron and hermione had just turned up in the common roompink faced from the cold wind and looking as though theyd had the time of their livesthanks said harry picking up a packet of tiny black pepper impswhats hogsmeade like where did you goby the sound of it everywhere dervish and banges the wizarding equipment shop zonkos joke shop into the three broomsticks for foaming mugs of hot butterbeer and many places besidesthe post office harry about two hundred owls all sitting on shelvesall color coded depending on how fast you want your letter to get therehoneydukes has got a new kind of fudge they were giving out free samples theres a bit look we think we saw an ogre honestly they get all sorts at the three broomsticks wish we could have brought you some butterbeer really warms you up what did you do said hermione looking anxious did you get any work doneno said harry lupin made me a cup of tea in his office and then snape came inhe told them all about the goblet rons mouth fell openlupin drank it he gasped is he madhermione checked her watchwed better go down you know the feastll be starting in fiveminutes they hurried through the portrait hole and into the crowd still discussing snapebut if he you know hermione dropped her voice glancing nervously around if he was trying to to poison lupin he wouldnt have done it in front of harryyeah maybe said harry as they reached the entrance hall and crossed into the great hall it had been decorated with hundreds and hundreds of candle filled pumpkins a cloud of fluttering live bats and many flaming orange streamers which were swimming lazily across the stormy ceiling like brilliant watersnakesthe food was delicious even hermione and ron who were full to bursting with honeydukes sweets managed second helpings of everything harry kept glancing at the staff table professor lupin looked cheerful and as well as he ever did he was talking animatedly to tiny little professor flitwick the charms teacher harry moved his eyes along the table to the place where snape sat was he imagining it or were snapes eyes flickering toward lupin more often than was naturalthe feast finished with an entertainment provided by the hogwarts ghosts they popped out of the walls and tables to do a bit of formation gliding nearly headless nick the gryffindor ghost had a great success with a reenactment of his own botched beheadingit had been such a pleasant evening that harrys good mood couldnt even be spoiled by malfoy who shouted through the crowd as they all left the hall the dementors send their love potterharry ron and hermione followed the rest of the gryffindors along the usual path to gryffindor tower but when they reached the corridor that ended with the portrait of the fat lady they found it jammed with studentswhy isnt anyone going in said ron curiouslyharry peered over the heads in front of him the portrait seemed to be closedlet me through please came percys voice and he came bustling importantly through the crowd whats the holdup here you cant all have forgotten the password excuse me im head boy and then a silence fell over the crowd from the front first so that a chill seemed to spread down the corridor they heard percy say in asuddenly sharp voice somebody get professor dumbledore quickpeoples heads turned those at the back were standing on tiptoewhats going on said ginny who had just arriveda moment later professor dumbledore was there sweeping toward the portrait the gryffindors squeezed together to let him through and harry ron and hermione moved closer to see what the trouble wasoh my hermione grabbed harrys armthe fat lady had vanished from her portrait which had been slashed so viciously that strips of canvas littered the floor great chunks of it had been torn away completelydumbledore took one quick look at the ruined painting and turned his eyes somber to see professors mcgonagall lupin and snape hurrying toward himwe need to find her said dumbledore professor mcgonagall please go to mr filch at once and tell him to search every painting in the castle for the fat ladyyoull be lucky said a cackling voiceit was peeves the poltergeist bobbing over the crowd and looking delighted as he always did at the sight of wreckage or worrywhat do you mean peeves said dumbledore calmly and peevess grin faded a little he didnt dare taunt dumbledore instead he adopted an oily voice that was no better than his cackle ashamed your headshipsit doesnt want to be seen shes a horrible mess saw her running through the landscape up on the fourth floor sir dodging between the trees crying something dreadful he said happily poor thing he added unconvincinglydid she say who did it said dumbledore quietlyoh yes professorhead said peeves with the air of one cradling alarge bombshell in his arms he got very angry when she wouldnt let him in you see peeves flipped over and grinned at dumbledore from between his own legs nasty temper hes got that sirius blackchapter nine grim defeatprofessor dumbledore sent all the gryffindors back to the great hallwhere they were joined ten minutes later by the students from hufflepuff ravenclaw and slytherin who all looked extremely confusedthe teachers and i need to conduct a thorough search of the castleprofessor dumbledore told them as professors mcgonagall and flitwick closed all doors into the hall im afraid that for your own safetyyou will have to spend the night here i want the prefects to stand guard over the entrances to the hall and i am leaving the head boy and girl in charge any disturbance should be reported to me immediatelyhe added to percy who was looking immensely proud and important send word with one of the ghostsprofessor dumbledore paused about to leave the hall and said ohyes youll be needingone casual wave of his wand and the long tables flew to the edges of the hall and stood themselves against the walls another wave and the floor was covered with hundreds of squashy purple sleeping bagssleep well said professor dumbledore closing the door behind himthe hall immediately began to buzz excitedly the gryffindors were telling the rest of the school what had just happenedeveryone into their sleeping bags shouted percy come on now no more talking lights out in ten minutescmon ron said to harry and hermione they seized three sleeping bags and dragged them into a cornerdo you think blacks still in the castle hermione whisperedanxiouslydumbledore obviously thinks he might be said ronits very lucky he picked tonight you know said hermione as they climbed fully dressed into their sleeping bags and propped themselves on their elbows to talk the one night we werent in the toweri reckon hes lost track of time being on the run said ron didnt realize it was halloween otherwise hed have come bursting in herehermione shudderedall around them people were asking one another the same question how did he get inmaybe he knows how to apparate said a ravenclaw a few feet awayjust appear out of thin air you knowdisguised himself probably said a hufflepuff fifth year he couldve flown in suggested dean thomashonestly am i the only person whos ever bothered to read hogwarts a history said hermione crossly to harry and ronprobably said ron whybecause the castles protected by more than walls you know said hermione there are all sorts of enchantments on it to stop people entering by stealth you cant just apparate in here and id like to see the disguise that could fool those dementors theyre guarding every single entrance to the grounds theyd have seen him fly in too and fitch knows all the secret passages theyll have them coveredthe lights are going out now percy shouted i want everyone in their sleeping bags and no more talkingthe candles all went out at once the only light now came from the silvery ghosts who were drifting about talking seriously to the prefects and the enchanted ceiling which like the sky outside wasscattered with stars what with that and the whispering that still filled the hall harry felt as though he were sleeping outdoors in a light windonce every hour a teacher would reappear in the hall to check that everything was quiet around three in the morning when many students had finally fallen asleep professor dumbledore came in harry watched him looking around for percy who had been prowling between the sleeping bags telling people off for talking percy was only a short way away from harry ron and hermlone who quickly pretended to be asleep as dumbledores footsteps drew nearerany sign of him professor asked percy in a whisperno all well hereeverything under control sirgood theres no point moving them all now ive found a temporary guardian for the gryffindor portrait hole youll be able to move them back in tomorrowand the fat lady sirhiding in a map of argyllshire on the second floor apparently she refused to let black in without the password so he attacked shes still very distressed but once shes calmed down ill have mr filch restore herharry heard the door of the hall creak open again and more footstepsheadmaster it was snape harry kept quite still listening hard the whole of the third floor has been searched hes not there and filch has done the dungeons nothing there eitherwhat about the astronomy tower professor trelawneys room the owleryall searchedvery well severus i didnt really expect black to lingerhave you any theory as to how he got in professor asked snapeharry raised his head very slightly off his arms to free his other earmany severus each of them as unlikely as the nextharry opened his eyes a fraction and squinted up to where they stood dumbledores back was to him but he could see percys face rapt with attention and snapes profile which looked angryyou remember the conversation we had headmaster just before ah the start of term said snape who was barely opening his lips as though trying to block percy out of the conversationi do severus said dumbledore and there was something like warning in his voiceit seems almost impossible that black could have entered the school without inside help i did express my concerns whet you appointed i do not believe a single person inside this castle would have helped black enter it said dumbledore and his tone made it so clear that the subject was closed that snape didnt reply i must go down to the dementors said dumbledore i said i would inform them when our search was completedidnt they want to help sit said percyoh yes said dumbledore coldly but im afraid no dementor will cross the threshold of this castle while i am headmasterpercy looked slightly abashed dumbledore left the hall walking quickly and quietly snape stood for a moment watching the headmaster with an expression of deep resentment on his face then he too leftharry glanced sideways at ron and hermione both of them had their eyes open too reflecting the starry ceilingwhat was all that about ron mouthedthe school talked of nothing but sirius black for the next few days the theories about how he had entered the castle became wilder and wilder hannah abbott from hufflepuff spent much of their next herbology class telling anyone whod listen that black could turn into a flowering shrubthe fat ladys ripped canvas had been taken off the wall and replaced with the portrait of sir cadogan and his fat gray pony nobody was very happy about this sir cadogan spent half his time challenging people to duels and the rest thinking up ridiculously complicated passwords which he changed at least twice a dayhes a complete lunatic said seamus finnigan angrily to percy cant we get anyone elsenone of the other pictures wanted the job said percy frightened of what happened to the fat lady sir cadogan was the only one brave enough to volunteersir cadogan however was the least of harrys worries he was now being closely watched teachers found excuses to walk along corridors with him and percy weasley acting harry suspected on his mothers orders was tailing him everywhere like an extremely pompous guard dog to cap it all professor mcgonagall summoned harry into her office with such a somber expression on her face harry thought someone must have diedtheres no point hiding it from you any longer potter she said in a very serious voice i know this will come as a shock to you but sirius black i know hes after me said harry wearily i heard rons dad telling his mum mr weasley works for the ministry of magicprofessor mcgonagall seemed very taken aback she stared at harry for a moment or two then said i see well in that case potter youll understand why i dont think its a good idea for you to be practicingquidditch in the evenings out on the field with only your team membersits very exposed potter weve got our first match on saturday said harry outraged ive got to train professorprofessor mcgonagall considered him intently harry knew she was deeply interested in the gryffindor teams prospects it had been she after all whod suggested him as seeker in the first place he waitedholding his breathhmm professor mcgonagall stood up and stared out of the window at the quidditch field just visible through the rain well goodness knows id like to see us win the cup at last but all the samepotter id be happier if a teacher were present ill ask madam hooch to oversee your training sessionsthe weather worsened steadily as the first quidditch match drew nearerundaunted the gryffindor team was training harder than ever under the eye of madam hooch then at their final training session before saturdays match oliver wood gave his team some unwelcome newswere not playing slytherin he told them looking very angryflints just been to see me were playing hufflepuff insteadwhy chorused the rest of the teamflints excuse is that their seekers arms still injured said woodgrinding his teeth furiously but its obvious why theyre doing itdont want to play in this weather think itll damage their chancesthere had been strong winds and heavy rain all day and as wood spokethey heard a distant rumble of thundertheres nothing wrong with malfoys arm said harry furiously hes faking iti know that but we cant prove it said wood bitterly and weve been practicing all those moves assuming were playing slytherin andinstead its hufflepuff and their styles quite different theyve got a new captain and seeker cedric diggory angelina alicia and katie suddenly giggledwhat said wood frowning at this lighthearted behaviorhes that tall good looking one isnt he said angelinastrong and silent said katie and they started to giggle againhes only silent because hes too thick to string two words togethersaid fred impatiently i dont know why youre worried oliverhufflepuff is a pushover last time we played them harry caught the snitch in about five minutes rememberwe were playing in completely different conditions wood shouted his eyes bulging slightly diggorys put a very strong side together hes an excellent seeker i was afraid youd take it like this we mustnt relax we must keep our focus slytherin is trying to wrong foot us we must winoliver calm down said fred looking slightly alarmed were taking hufflepuff very seriously seriouslythe day before the match the winds reached howling point and the rain fell harder than ever it was so dark inside the corridors and classrooms that extra torches and lanterns were lit the slytherin team was looking very smug indeed and none more so than malfoyah if only my arm was feeling a bit better he sighed as the gale outside pounded the windowsharry had no room in his head to worry about anything except the match tomorrow oliver wood kept hurrying up to him between classes and giving him tips the third time this happened wood talked for so long that harry suddenly realized he was ten minutes late for defense against the dark arts and set off at a run with wood shouting after him diggorys got a very fast swerve harry so you might want to try looping him harry skidded to a halt outside the defense against the dark arts classroom pulled the door open and dashed insidesorry im late professor lupin i but it wasnt professor lupin who looked up at him from the teachers desk it was snapethis lesson began ten minutes ago potter so i think well make it ten points from gryffindor sit downbut harry didnt movewheres professor lupin he saidhe says he is feeling too ill to teach today said snape with a twisted smile i believe i told you to sit downbut harry stayed where he waswhats wrong with himsnapes black eyes glitterednothing life threatening he said looking as though he wished it were five more points from gryffindor and if i have to ask you to sit down again it will be fiftyharry walked slowly to his seat and sat down snape looked around at the classas i was saying before potter interrupted professor lupin has not left any record of the topics you have covered so far please sir weve done boggarts red caps kappas and grindylowssaid hermione quickly and were just about to start be quiet said snape coldly i did not ask for information i was merely commenting on professor lupins lack of organizationhes the best defense against the dark arts teacher weve ever hadsaid dean thomas boldly and there was a murmur of agreement from the rest of the class snape looked more menacing than everyou are easily satisfied lupin is hardly overtaxing you i would expect first years to be able to deal with red caps and grindylowstoday we shall discuss harry watched him flick through the textbook to the very back chapterwhich he must know they hadnt coveredwerewolves said snapebut sir said hermione seemingly unable to restrain herself were not supposed to do werewolves yet were due to start hinkypunks miss granger said snape in a voice of deadly calm i was under the impression that i am teaching this lesson not you and i am telling you all to turn to page he glanced around again all of you nowwith many bitter sidelong looks and some sullen muttering the class opened their bookswhich of you can tell me how we distinguish between the werewolf and the true wolf said snapeeveryone sat in motionless silence everyone except hermione whose hand as it so often did had shot straight into the airanyone snape said ignoring hermione his twisted smile was backare you telling me that professor lupin hasnt even taught you the basic distinction between we told you said parvati suddenly we havent got as far as werewolves yet were still on silence snarled snape well well well i never thought id meet a third year class who wouldnt even recognize a werewolf when they saw one i shall make a point of informing professor dumbledore how very behind you all areplease sir said hermione whose hand was still in the air the werewolf differs from the true wolf in several small ways the snout of the werewolf that is the second time you have spoken out of turn miss grangersaid snape coolly five more points from gryffindor for being an insufferable know it allhermione went very red put down her hand and stared at the floor with her eyes full of tears it was a mark of how much the class loathed snape that they were all glaring at him because every one of them had called hermione a know it all at least once and ron who told hermione she was a know it all at least twice a week said loudly you asked us a question and she knows the answer why ask if you dont want to be toldthe class knew instantly hed gone too far snape advanced on ron slowly and the room held its breathdetention weasley snape said silkily his face very close to ronsand if i ever hear you criticize the way i teach a class again you will be very sorry indeedno one made a sound throughout the rest of the lesson they sat and made notes on werewolves from the textbook while snape prowled up and down the rows of desks examining the work they had been doing with professor lupinvery poorly explained that is incorrect the kappa is more commonly found in mongolia professor lupin gave this eight out of ten i wouldnt have given it threewhen the bell rang at last snape held them backyou will each write an essay to be handed in to me on the ways you recognize and kill werewolves i want two rolls of parchment or the subject and i want them by monday morning it is time somebody took this class in hand weasley stay behind we need to arrange your detentionharry and hermione left the room with the rest of the class who waited until they were well out of earshot then burst into a furious tirade about snapesnapes never been like this with any of our other defense against the dark arts teachers even if he did want the job harry said to hermione whys he got it in for lupin dyou think this is all because of the boggarti dont know said hermione pensively but i really hope professor lupin gets better soonron caught up with them five minutes later in a towering ragedyou know what that he called snape something that made hermione say ron is making me do ive got to scrub out the bedpans in the hospital wing without magic he was breathing deeply his fists clenched why couldnt black have hidden in snapes office eh he could have finished him off for usharry woke extremely early the next morning so early that it was till dark for a moment he thought the roaring of the wind had woken himthen he felt a cold breeze on the back of his neck and sat bolt upright peeves the poltergeist had been floating next to him blowing hard in his earwhat did you do that for said harry furiously peeves puffed out his cheeks blew hard and zoomed backward out of the room cacklingharry fumbled for his alarm clock and looked at it it was half past four cursing peeves he rolled over and tried to get back to sleep but it was very difficult now that he was awake to ignore the sounds of the thunder rumbling overhead the pounding of the wind against the castle walls and the distant creaking of the trees in the forbidden forest in a few hours he would be out on the quidditch field battling through that gale finally he gave up any thought of more sleep got up dressed picked up his nimbus two thousand and walked quietly out of the dormitoryas harry opened the door something brushed against his leg he bent down just in time to grab crookshanks by the end of his bushy tail and drag him outsideyou know i reckon ron was right about you harry told crookshanks suspiciously there are plenty of mice around this place go and chase them go on he added nudging crookshanks down the spiral staircase with his foot leave scabbers alonethe noise of the storm was even louder in the common roorn harry knew better than to think the match would be canceled quidditch matches werent called off for trifles like thunderstorms nevertheless he was starting to feel very apprehensive wood had pointed out cedric diggory to him in the corridor diggory was a fifth year and a lot bigger than harry seekers were usually light and speedy but diggorys weight would be an advantage in this weather because he was less likely to be blown off courseharry whiled away the hours until dawn in front of the fire getting up every now and then to stop crookshanks from sneaking up the boys staircase again at long last harry thought it must be time for breakfast so he headed through the portrait hole alonestand and fight you mangy cur yelled sir cadoganoh shut up harry yawnedhe revived a bit over a large bowl of porridge and by the time hed started on toast the rest of the team had turned upits going to be a tough one said wood who wasnt eating anythingstop worrying oliver said alicia soothingly we dont mind a bit of rainbut it was considerably more than a bit of rain such was the popularity of quidditch that the whole school turned out to watch the match as usual but they ran down the lawns toward the quidditch field headsbowed against the ferocious wind umbrellas being whipped out of their hands as they went just before he entered the locker room harry saw malfoy crabbe and goyle laughing and pointing at him from under an enormous umbrella on their way to the stadiumthe team changed into their scarlet robes and waited for woods usual pre match pep talk but it didnt come he tried to speak several timesmade an odd gulping noise then shook his head hopelessly and beckoned them to follow himthe wind was so strong that they staggered sideways as they walked out onto the field if the crowd was cheering they couldnt hear it over the fresh rolls of thunder rain was splattering over harrys glasseshow on earth was he going to see the snitch in thisthe hufflepuffs were approaching from the opposite side of the fieldwearing canary yellow robes the captains walked up to eacb other and shook hands diggory smiled at wood but wood no looked as though he had lockjaw and merely nodded harry saw madam hoochs mouth form the wordsmount your brooms he pulled his right foot out of the mud with a squelch and swung it over his nimbus two thousand madam hooch put her whistle to her lips and gave it a blast that sounded shrill and distant they were off harry rose fast but his nimbus was swerving slightly with the wind he held it as steady as he could and turned squinting into the rainwithin five minutes harry was soaked to his skin and frozen hardly able to see his teammates let alone the tiny snitch he flew backward and forward across the field past blurred red and yellow shapes with no idea of what was happening in the rest of the game he couldnt hear the commentary over the wind the crowd was hidden beneath a sea of cloaks and battered umbrellas twice harry came very close to being unseated by a bludger his vision was so clouded by the rain on his glasses he hadnt seen them cominghe lost track of time it was getting harder and harder to hold his broom straight the sky was getting darker as though night had decided to come early twice harry nearly hit another player without knowing whether it was a teammate or opponent everyone was now so wet and therain so thick he could hardly tell them apartwith the first flash of lightning came the sound of madam hoochs whistle harry could just see the outline of wood through the thick rain gesturing him to the ground the whole team splashed down into the mudi called for time out wood roared at his team come on under here they huddled at the edge of the field under a large umbrella harry took off his glasses and wiped them hurriedly on his robeswhats the scorewere fifty points up said wood but unless we get the snitch soonwell be playing into the nightive got no chance with these on harry said exasperatedly waving his glassesat that very moment hermione appeared at his shoulder she was holding her cloak over her head and was inexplicably beamingive had an idea harry give me your glasses quickhe handed them to her and as the team watched in amazement hermione tapped them with her wand and said imperviusthere she said handing them back to harry theyll repel waterwood looked as though he could have kissed herbrilliant he called hoarsely after her as she disappeared into the crowd okay team lets go for ithermiones spell had done the trick harry was still numb with coldstill wetter than hed ever been in his life but he could see full of fresh determination he urged his broom through the turbulent airstaring in every direction for the snitch avoiding a bludger duckingbeneath diggory who was streaking in the opposite directionthere was another clap of thunder followed immediately by forked lightning this was getting more and more dangerous harry needed to get the snitch quickly he turned intending to head back toward the middle of the field but at that moment another flash of lightning illuminated the stands and harry saw something that distracted him completely the silhouette of an enormous shaggy black dog clearly imprinted against the skymotionless in the topmost empty row of seatsharrys numb hands slipped on the broom handle and his nimbus dropped a few feet shaking his sodden bangs out of his eyes he squinted back into the stands the dog had vanishedharry came woods anguished yell from the gryffindor goal postsharry behind youharry looked wildly around cedric diggory was pelting up the field and a tiny speck of gold was shimmering in the rain filled air between them with a jolt of panic harry threw himself flat to the broornhandle and zoomed toward the snitchcome on he growled at his nimbus as the rain whipped his facetasterbut something odd was happening an eerie silence was falling across the stadium the wind though as strong as ever was forgetting to roar it was as though someone had turned off the sound as though harry had gone suddenly deaf what was going onand then a horribly familiar wave of cold swept over him inside himjust as he became aware of something moving on the field belowbefore hed had time to think harry had taken his eyes off the snitch and looked downat least a hundred dementors their hidden faces pointing up at himwere standing beneath him it was as though freezing water were rising in his chest cutting at his insides and then he heard it againsomeone was screaming screaming inside his head a womannot harry not harry please not harrystand aside you silly girl stand aside nownot harry please no take me kill me instead numbing swirling white mist was filling harrys brain what was he doing why was he flying he needed to help her she was going to die she was going to be murderedhe was falling falling through the icy mistnot harry please have mercy have mercya shrill voice was laughing the woman was screaming and harry knew no morelucky the ground was so softi thought he was dead for surebut he didnt even break his glassesharry could hear the voices whispering but they made no sense whatsoever he didnt have a clue where he was or how hed got thereor what hed been doing before he got there all he knew was that every inch of him was aching as though it had been beatenthat was the scariest thing ive ever seen in my lifescariest the scariest thing hooded black figures cold screamingharrys eyes snapped open he was lying in the hospital wing the gryffindor quidditch team spattered with mud from head to foot wasgathered around his bed ron and hermione were also there looking as though theyd just climbed out of a swimming poolharry said fred who looked extremely white underneath the mudhowre you feelingit was as though harrys memory was on fast forward the lightning the grim the snitch and the dementorswhat happened he said sitting up so suddenly they all gaspedyou fell off said fred mustve been what fifty feetwe thought youd died said alicia who was shakinghermione made a small squeaky noise her eyes were extremely bloodshotbut the match said harry what happened are we doing a replayno one said anything the horrible truth sank into harry like a stonewe didnt losediggory got the snitch said george just after you fell he didnt realize what had happened when he looked back and saw you on the ground he tried to call it off wanted a rematch but they won fair and square even wood admits itwhere is wood said harry suddenly realizing he wasnt therestill in the showers said fred we think hes trying to drown himselfharry put his face to his knees his hands gripping his hair fred grabbed his shoulder and shook it roughlycmon harry youve never missed the snitch beforethere had to be one time you didnt get it said georgeits not over yet said fred we lost by a hundred pointsright so if hufflepuff loses to ravenclaw and we beat ravenclaw and slytherin hufflepuffll have to lose by at least two hundred points said georgebut if they beat ravenclawno way ravenclaw is too good but if slytherin loses against hufflepuffit all depends on the points a margin of a hundred either wayharry lay there not saying a word they had lost for the first time ever he had lost a quidditch matchafter ten minutes or so madam pomfrey came over to tell the team to leave him in peacewell come and see you later fred told him dont beat yourself upharry youre still the best seeker weve ever hadthe team trooped out trailing mud behind them madam pomfrey shut the door behind them looking disapproving ron and hermione moved nearer to harrys beddumbledore was really angry hermione said in a quaking voice ive never seen him like that before he ran onto the field as you fellwaved his wand and you sort of slowed down before you hit the groundthen he whirled his wand at the dementors shot silver stuff at themthey left the stadium right away he was furious theyd come onto the grounds we heard him then he magicked you onto a stretcher said ron and walked up to school with you floating on it everyone thought you were his voice faded but harry hardly noticed he was thinking about what the dementors had done to him about the screaming voice he looked upand saw ron and hermione lookin at him so anxiously that he quickly cast around for something matter of fact to saydid someone get my nimbusron and hermione looked quickly at each otherer what said harry looking from one to the otherwell when you fell off it got blown away said hermione hesitantlyandand it hit it hit oh harry it hit the whomping willowharrys insides lurched the whomping willow was a very violent tree that stood alone in the middle of the groundsand he said dreading the answerwell you know the whomping willow said ron it it doesnt like being hitprofessor flitwick brought it back just before you came around said hermione in a very small voiceslowly she reached down for a bag at her feet turned it upside downand tipped a dozen bits of splintered wood and twig onto the bed the only remains of harrys faithful finally beaten broomstickchapter ten the marauders mapmadam pomfrey insisted on keeping harry in the hospital wing for the rest of the weekend he didnt argue or complain but he wouldnt let her throw away the shattered remnants of his nimbus two thousand heknew he was being stupid knew that the nimbus was beyond repair but harry couldnt help it he felt as though hed lost one of his best friendshe had a stream of visitors all intent on cheering him up hagrid sent him a bunch of earwiggy flowers that looked like yellow cabbages and ginny weasley blushing furiously turned up with a get well card she had made herself which sang shrilly unless harry kept it shut under his bowl of fruit the gryffindor team visited again on sunday morning this time accompanied by wood who told harry in a hollow dead sort of voice that he didnt blame him in the slightest ron and hermione left harrys bedside only at night but nothing anyone said or did could make harry feel any betterbecause they knew only half of what was troubling himhe hadnt told anyone about the grim not even ron and hermionebecause he knew ron would panic and hermione would scoff the fact remained however that it had now appeared twice and both appearances had been followed by near fatal accidents the first time he had nearly been run over by the knight bus the second fallen fifty feet from his broomstick was the grim going to haunt him until he actually died was he going to spend the rest of his life looking over his shoulder for the beastand then there were the dementors harry felt sick and humiliated every time he thought of them everyone said the dementors were horrible but no one else collapsed every time they went near one no one else heard echoes in their head of their dying parentsbecause harry knew who that screaming voice belonged to now he had heard her words heard them over and over again during the night hours in the hospital wing while he lay awake staring at the strips of moonlight on the ceiling when the dementors approached him he heard the last moments of his mothers life her attempts to protect himharry from lord voldemort and voldemorts laughter before he murdered her harry dozed fitfully sinking into dreams full of clammy rotted hands and petrified pleading jerking awake to dwell again on hismothers voiceit was a relief to return to the noise and bustle of the main school on monday where he was forced to think about other things eve if he had to endure draco malfoys taunting malfoy was almost beside himself with glee at gryffindors defeat he had finally taken off his bandages and celebrated having the full use of both arms again by doing spirited imitations of harry falling off his broom malfoy spent much of their next potions class doing dementor imitations across the dungeon ron finally cracked and flung a large slippery crocodile heart at malfoywhich hit him in the face and caused snape to take fifty points from gryffindorif snapes teaching defense against the dark arts again im skiving off said ron as they headed toward lupins classroom after lunchcheck whos in there hermionehermione peered around the classroom doorits okayprofessor lupin was back at work it certainly looked as though he had been ill his old robes were hanging more loosely on him and there were dark shadows beneath his eyes nevertheless he smiled at the class as they took their seats and they burst at once into an explosion of complaints about snapes behavior while lupin had been illits not fair he was only filling in why should he give us homeworkwe dont know anything about werewolves two rolls of parchmentdid you tell professor snape we havent covered them yet lupin askedfrowning slightlythe babble broke out againyes but he said we were really behind he wouldnt listen two rolls of parchmentprofessor lupin smiled at the look of indignation on every facedont worry ill speak to professor snape you dont have to do the essayoh no said hermione looking very disappointed ive already finished itthey had a very enjoyable lesson professor lupin had brought along a glass box containing a hinkypunk a little one legged creature who looked as though he were made of wisps of smoke rather frail and harmless lookinglures travelers into bogs said professor lupin as they took notesyou notice the lantern dangling from his hand hops ahead people follow the light then the hinkypunk made a horrible squelching noise against the glasswhen the bell rang everyone gathered up their things and headed for the door harry among them but wait a moment harry lupin called id like a wordharry doubled back and watched professor lupin covering the hinkypunks box with a clothi heard about the match said lupin turning back to his desk and starting to pile books into his briefcase and im sorry about your broomstick is there any chance of fixing itno said harry the tree smashed it to bitslupin sighedthey planted the whomping willow the same year that i arrived at hogwarts people used to play a game trying to get near enough to touch the trunk in the end a boy called davey gudgeon nearly lost an eyeand we were forbidden to go near it no broomstick would have a chancedid you hear about the dementors too said harry with difficultylupin looked at him quicklyyes i did i dont think any of us have seen professor dumbledore that angry they have been growing restless for some time furious at his refusal to let them inside the grounds i suppose they were the reason you fellyes said harry he hesitated and then the question he had to ask burst from him before he could stop himself why why do they affect me like that am i just it has nothing to do with weakness said professor lupin sharply as though he had read harrys mind the dementors affect you worse than the others because there are horrors in your past that the others dont havea ray of wintery sunlight fell across the classroom illuminating lupins gray hairs and the lines on his young facedementors are among the foulest creatures that walk this earth they infest the darkest filthiest places they glory in decay and despairthey drain peace hope and happiness out of the air around them even muggles feel their presence though they cant see them get too near a dementor and every good feeling every happy memory will be sucked out of you if it can the dementor will feed on you long enough to reduce you to something like itself soul less and evil youll be left with nothing but the worst experiences of your life and the worst that happened to you harry is enough to make anyone fall off their broomyou have nothing to feel ashamed ofwhen they get near me harry stared at lupins desk his throat tight i can hear voldemort murdering my mumlupin made a sudden motion with his arm as though to grip harrys shoulder but thought better of it there was a moments silence then why did they have to come to the match said harry bitterlytheyre getting hungry said lupin coolly shutting his briefcase with a snap dumbledore wont let them into the school so their supply of human prey has dried up i dont think they could resist the large crowd around the quidditch field all that excitement emotions running high it was their idea of a feastazkaban must be terrible harry muttered lupin nodded grimlythe fortress is set on a tiny island way out to sea but they dont need walls and water to keep the prisoners in not when theyre all trapped inside their own heads incapable of a single cheery thoughtmost of them go mad within weeksbut sirius black escaped from them harry said slowly he got awaylupins briefcase slipped from the desk he had to stoop quickly to catch ityes he said straightening up black must have found a way to fight them i wouldnt have believed it possible dementors are supposed to drain a wizard of his powers if he is left with them too longyou made that dementor on the train back off said harry suddenlythere are certain defenses one can use said lupin but there was only one dementor on the train the more there are the more difficult it becomes to resistwhat defenses said harry at once can you teach mei dont pretend to be an expert at fighting dementors harry quite the contrarybut if the dementors come to another quidditch match i need to be able to fight them lupin looked into harrys determined face hesitated then saidwell all right ill try and help but itll have to wait until nextterm im afraid i have a lot to do before the holidays i chose a very inconvenient time to fall illwhat with the promise of anti dementor lessons from lupin the thought that he might never have to hear his mothers death again and the fact that ravenclaw flattened hufflepuff in their quidditch match at the end of november harrys mood took a definite upturn gryffindor were not out of the running after all although they could not afford to lose another match wood became repossessed of his manic energy and worked his team as hard as ever in the chilly haze of rain that persisted into december harry saw no hint of a dementor within the groundsdumbledores anger seemed to be keeping them at their stations at the entrancestwo weeks before the end of the term the sky lightened suddenly to a dazzling opaline white and the muddy grounds were revealed one morning covered in glittering frost inside the castle there was a buzz of christmas in the air professor flitwick the charms teacher had already decorated his classroom with shimmering lights that turned out to be real fluttering fairies the students were all happily discussing their plans for the holidays both ron and hermione had decided to remain at hogwarts and though ron said it was because he couldnt stand two weeks with percy and hermione insisted she needed to use the library harry wasnt fooled they were doing it to keep him companyand he was very gratefulto everyones delight except harrys there was to be another hogsmeade trip on the very last weekend of the termwe can do all our christmas shopping there said hermione mum and dad would really love those toothflossing stringmints from honeydukesresigned to the fact that he would be the only third year staying behind again harry borrowed a copy of which broomstick from wood and decided to spend the day reading up on the different makes he had been riding one of the school brooms at team practice an ancient shooting starwhich was very slow and jerky he definitely needed a new broom of his ownon the saturday morning of the hogsmeade trip harry bid good bye to ronand hermione who were wrapped in cloaks and scarves then turned up the marble staircase alone and headed back toward gryffindor tower snow had started to fall outside the windows and the castle was very still and quietpsst harryhe turned halfway along the third floor corridor to see fred and george peering out at him from behind a statue of a humpbacked one eyed witchwhat are you doing said harry curiously how come youre not going to hogsmeadeweve come to give you a bit of festive cheer before we go said fredwith a mysterious wink come in herehe nodded toward an empty classroom to the left of the one eyed statueharry followed fred and george inside george closed the door quietly and then turned beaming to look at harryearly christmas present for you harry he saidfred pulled something from inside his cloak with a flourish and laid it on one of the desks it was a large square very worn piece of parchment with nothing written on it harry suspecting one of fred and georges jokes stared at itwhats that supposed to bethis harry is the secret of our success said george patting the parchment fondlyits a wrench giving it to you said fred but we decided last night your needs greater than oursanyway we know it by heart said george we bequeath it to you we dont really need it anymoreand what do i need with a bit of old parchment said harrya bit of old parchment said fred closing his eyes with a grimace as though harry had mortally offended him explain georgewell when we were in our first year harry young carefree and innocent harry snorted he doubted whether fred and george had ever been innocentwell more innocent than we are now we got into a spot of bother with filchwe let off a dungbomb in the corridor and it upset him for some reason so he hauled us off to his office and started threatening us with the usual detention disembowelment and we couldnt help noticing a drawer in one of his filing cabinets marked confiscated and highly dangerousdont tell me said harry starting to grinwell what would youve done said fred george caused a diversion by dropping another dungbomb i whipped the drawer open and grabbed thisits not as bad as it sounds you know said george we dont reckon filch ever found out how to work it he probably suspected what it wasthough or he wouldnt have confiscated itand you know how to work itoh yes said fred smirking this little beautys taught us more than all the teachers in this schoolyoure winding me up said harry looking at the ragged old bit of parchmentoh are we said georgehe took out his wand touched the parchment lightly and said i solemnly swear that i am up to no goodand at once thin ink lines began to spread like a spiders web from the point that georges wand had touched they joined each other they crisscrossed they fanned into every corner of the parchment then words began to blossom across the top great curly green words that proclaimedmessrs moony wormtail padfoot and prongs purveyors of aids to magical mischief makers are proud to present the marauders map it was a map showing every detail of the hogwarts castle and groundsbut the truly remarkable thing were the tiny ink dots moving around iteach labeled with a name in minuscule writing astounded harry bent over it a labeled dot in the top left corner showed that professor dumbledore was pacing his study the caretakers cat mrs norris was prowling the second floor and peeves the poltergeist was currently bouncing around the trophy room and as harrys eyes traveled up and down the familiar corridors he noticed something elsethis map showed a set of passages he had never entered and many of them seemed to lead right into hogsmeade said fred tracing one of them with his fingerthere are seven in all now filch knows about these four he pointed them out but were sure were the only ones who know about these dont bother with the one behind the mirror on the fourth floorwe used it until last winter but its caved in completely blockedand we dont reckon anyones ever used this one because the whomping willows planted right over the entrance but this one here this one leads right into the cellar of honeydukes weve used it loads of timesand as you mightve noticed the entrance is right outside this roomthrough that one eyed old crones humpmoony wormtaill padfoot and prongs sighed george patting the heading of the map we owe them so muchnoble men working tirelessly to help a new generation of lawbreakerssaid fred solemnlyright said george briskly dont forget to wipe it after youve used it or anyone can read it fred said warninglyjust tap it again and say mischief managed and itll go blankso young harry said fred in an uncanny impersonation of percymind you behave yourselfsee you in honeydukes said george winkingthey left the room both smirking in a satisfied sort of wayharry stood there gazing at the miraculous map he watched the tiny ink mrs norris turn left and pause to sniff at something on the floor if filch really didnt know he wouldnt have to pass the dementors at allbut even as he stood there flooded with excitement something harry had once heard mr weasley say came floating out of his memorynever trust anything that can think for itself if you cant see where it keeps its brainthis map was one of those dangerous magical objects mr weasley had been warning against aids for magical mischief makers but then harry reasoned he only wanted to use it to get into hogsmeade it wasnt as though he wanted to steal anything or attack anyone and fred and george had been using it for years without anything horrible happeningharry traced the secret passage to honeydukes with his fingerthen quite suddenly as though following orders he rolled up the mapstuffed it inside his robes and hurried to the door of the classroomhe opened it a couple of inches there was no one outside very carefully he edged out of the room and behind the statue of theone eyed witchwhat did he have to do he pulled out the map again and saw to his astonishment that a new ink figure had appeared upon it labeled harry potter this figure was standing exactly where the real harry was standing about halfway down the third floor corridorharry watched carefully his little ink self appeared to be tapping the witch with his minute wand harry quickly took out his real wand and tapped the statue nothing happened he looked back at the map the tiniest speech bubble had appeared next to his figure the word inside said dissendiumdissendium harry whispered tapping the stone witch againat once the statues hump opened wide enough to admit a fairly thin person harry glanced quickly up and down the corridor then tucked the map away again hoisted himself into the hole headfirst and pushed himself forwardhe slid a considerable way down what felt like a stone slide then landed on cold damp earth he stood up looking around it was pitch dark he held up his wand muttered lumos and saw that he was in a very narrow low earthy passageway he raised the map tapped it with the tip of his wand and muttered mischief managed the map went blank at once he folded it carefully tucked it inside his robes thenheart beating fast both excited and apprehensive he set offthe passage twisted and turned more like the burrow of a giant rabbit than anything else harry hurried along it stumbling now and then on the uneven floor holding his wand out in front of himit took ages but harry had the thought of honeydukes to sustain himafter what felt like an hour the passage began to rise panting harry sped up his face hot his feet very coldten minutes later he came to the foot of some worn stone steps which rose out of sight above him careful not to make any noise harry began to climb a hundred steps two hundred steps he lost count as heclimbed watching his feet then without warning his head hit something hardit seemed to be a trapdoor harry stood there massaging the top of his head listening he couldnt hear any sounds above him very slowly he pushed the trapdoor open and peered over the edgehe was in a cellar which was full of wooden crates and boxes harry climbed out of the trapdoor and replaced it it blended so perfectly with the dusty floor that it was impossible to tell it was there harry crept slowly toward the wooden staircase that led upstairs now he could definitely hear voices not to mention the tinkle of a bell and the opening and shutting of a doorwondering what he ought to do he suddenly heard a door open much closer at hand somebody was about to come downstairsand get another box of jelly slugs dear theyve nearly cleaned us out said a womans voicea pair of feet was coming down the staircase harry leapt behind an enormous crate and waited for the footsteps to pass he heard the man shifting boxes against the opposite wall he might not get another chance quickly and silently harry dodged out from his hiding place and climbed the stairs looking back he saw an enormous backside and shiny bald head buried in a box harry reached the door at the top of the stairsslipped through it and found himself behind the counter of honeydukes he ducked crept sideways and then straightened uphoneydukes was so crowded with hogwarts students that no one looked twice at harry he edged among them looking around and suppressed a laugh as he imagined the look that would spread over dudleys piggy face if he could see where harry was nowthere were shelves upon shelves of the most succulent looking sweets imaginable creamy chunks of nougat shimmering pink squares of coconut ice fat honey colored toffees hundreds of different kinds of chocolate in neat rows there was a large barrel of every flavor beansand another of fizzing whizbees the levitating sherbert balls that ron had mentioned along yet another wall were special effects sweetsdroobles best blowing gum which filled a room with bluebell colored bubbles that refused to pop for days the strange splintery toothflossing stringmints tiny black pepper imps breathe fire for your friends ice mice hear your teeth chatter and squeakpeppermint creams shaped like toads hop realistically in the stomach fragile sugar spun quills and exploding bonbonsharry squeezed himself through a crowd of sixth years and saw a sign hanging in the farthest corner of the shop unusual tastes ron and hermione were standing underneath it examining a tray of blood flavored lollipops harry sneaked up behind themugh no harry wont want one of those theyre for vampires i expect hermione was sayinghow about these said ron shoving a jar of cockroach clusters under hermiones nosedefinitely not said harryron nearly dropped the jarharry squealed hermione what are you doing here how how did you wow said ron looking very impressed youve learned to apparatecourse i havent said harry he dropped his voice so that none of the sixth years could hear him and told them all about the marauders maphow come fred and george never gave it to me said ron outraged im their brotherbut harry isnt going to keep it said hermione as though the idea were ludicrous hes going to hand it in to professor mcgonagallarent you harryno im not said harryare you mad said ron goggling at hermione hand in something that goodif i hand it in ill have to say where i got it filch would know fred and george had nicked itbut what about sirius black hermione hissed he could be using one of the passages on that map to get into the castle the teachers have got to knowhe cant be getting in through a passage said harry quickly there are seven secret tunnels on the map right fred and george reckon filch already knows about four of them and of the other three one of thems caved in so no one can get through it one of thems got the whomping willow planted over the entrance so you cant get out of itand the one i just came through well its really hard to see the entrance to it down in the cellar so unless he knew it was thereharry hesistated what if black did know the passage was thereron however cleared his throat significantly and pointed to a notice pasted on the inside of the sweetshop doorby order of the ministry of magic customers are reminded that until further notice dementors will be patrolling the streets of hogsmeade every night after sundown this measure has been put in place for the safety of hogsmeade residents and will be lifted upon the recapture of sirius black it is therefore advisable that you complete your shopping well before nightfallmerry christmassee said ron quietly id like to see black

leading him over to their barrel and the jelly slugs and the acid pops fred gave me one of those when i was seven it burnt a hole right through my tongue i remember mum walloping him with her broomstick ron stared broodingly into the acid pop box reckon fredd take a bit of cockroach cluster if i told him they were peanutswhen ron and hermione had paid for all their sweets the three of them left honeydukes for the blizzard outsidehogsmeade looked like a christmas card the little thatched cottages and shops were all covered in a layer of crisp snow there were holly wreaths on the doors and strings of enchanted candles hanging in the treesharry shivered unlike the other two he didnt have his cloak they headed up the street heads bowed against the wind ron and hermione shouting through their scarvesthats the post office zonkos is up there we could go up to the shrieking shacktell you what said ron his teeth chattering shall we go for a butterbeer in the three broomsticksharry was more than willing the wind was fierce and his hands were freezing so they crossed the road and in a few minutes were entering the tiny innit was extremely crowded noisy warm and smoky a curvy sort of woman with a pretty face was serving a bunch of rowdy warlock up at the barthats madam rosmerta said ron ill get the drinks shall i he added going slightly redharry and hermione made their way to the back of the room her there was a small vacant table between the window and a handsome christmas tree which stood next to the fireplace ron came back five minutes later carrying three foaming tankards of hot butterbeermerry christmas he said happily raising his tankardharry drank deeply it was the most delicious thing hed ever tasted and seemed to heat every bit of him from the insidea sudden breeze ruffled his hair the door of the three broomsticks had opened again harry looked over the rim of his tankard and chokedprofessors mcgonagall and flitwick had just entered the pub with a flurry of snowflakes shortly followed by hagrid who was deep in conversation with a portly man in a lime green bowler hat and a pinstriped cloak cornelius fudge minister of magicin an instant ron and hermione had both placed hands on the top of harrys head and forced him off his stool and under the table dripping with butterbeer and crouching out of sight harry clutched his empty tankard and watched the teachers and fudges feet move toward the barpause then turn and walk right toward himsomewhere above him hermione whispered mobiliarbusthe christmas tree beside their table rose a few inches off the grounddrifted sideways and landed with a soft thump right in front of their table hiding them from view staring through the dense lower branchesharry saw four sets of chair legs move back from the table right beside theirs then heard the grunts and sighs if the teachers and minister as they sat downnext he saw another pair of feet wearing sparkly turquoise high heelsand heard a womans voice a small gillywater mine said professor mcgonagalls voicefour pints of mulled mead ta rosmerta said hagrida cherry syrup and soda with ice and umbrella mmm said professor flitwick smacking his lipsso youll be the red currant rum ministerthank you rosmerta mdear said fudges voice lovely to see you again i must say have one yourself wont you come and join uswell thank you very much ministerharry watched the glittering heels march away and back again his heart was pounding uncomfortably in his throat why hadnt it occurred to him that this was the last weekend of term for the teachers to& and how long were they going to sit there he needed time to sneak back into honeydukes if he wanted to return to school tonight hermiones leg gave a nervous twitch next to himso what brings you to this neck of the woods minister came madam rosmertas voiceharry saw the lower part of fudges thick body twist in his chair as though he were checking for eavesdroppers then he said in a quiet voice what else mdear but sirius black i daresay you heard whathappened up at the school at halloweeni did hear a rumor admitted madam rosmertadid you tell the whole pub hagrid said professor mcgonagall exasperatedlydo you think blacks still in the area minister whispered madam rosmertaim sure of it said fudge shortlyyou know that the dementors have searched the whole village twjcesaid madam rosmerta a slight edge to her voice scared all my customers away its very bad for business ministerrosmerta dear i dont like them any more than you do said fudge uncomfortably necessary precaution unfortunate but there you are ive just met some of them theyre in a fury against dumbledore he wont let them inside the castle groundsi should think not said professor mcgonagall sharply how are we supposed to teach with those horrors floating aroundhear hear squeaked tiny professor flitwick whose feet were dangling a foot from the groundall the same demurred fudge they are here to protect you all from something much worse we all know what blacks capable ofdo you know i still have trouble believing it said madam rosmerta thoughtfully of all the people to go over to the dark side sirius black was the last id have thought i mean i remember him when he was a boy at hogwarts if youd told me then what he was going to become id have said youd had too much meadyou dont know the half of it rosmerta said fudge gruffly the worst he did isnt widely knownthe worst said madam rosmerta her voice alive with curiosity worsethan murdering all those poor people you meani certainly do said fudgei caa believe that what could possibly be worse you say you remember him at hogwarts rosmerta mur mured professor mcgonagalldo you remember who his best friend wasnaturally said madam rosmerta with a small laugh never saw one without the other did you the number of times i had them in here ooh they used to make me laugh quite the double act sirius black and james potterharry dropped his tankard with a loud clunk ron kicked himprecisely said professor mcgonagall black and potter ringleaders of their little gang both very bright of course exceptionally bright in fact but i dont think weve ever had such a pair of troublemakers i dunno chuckled hagrid fred and george weasley could give em a run fer their moneyyoud have thought black and potter were brothers chimed in professor flitwick inseparableof course they were said fudge potter trusted black beyond all his other friends nothing changed when they left school black was best man when james married lily then they named him godfather to harry harry has no idea of course you can imagine how the idea would torment himbecause black turned out to be in league with you know who whispered madam rosmertaworse even than that rndear fudge dropped his voice and proceeded in a sort of low rumble not many people are aware that the potters knew you know who was after them dumbledore who was of course working tirelessly against you know who had a number of useful spiesone of them tipped him off and he alerted james and lily at once he advised them to go into hiding well of course you know who wasnt aneasy person to hide from dumbledore told them that their best chance was the fidelius charmhow does that work said madam rosmerta breathless with interestprofessor flitwick cleared his throatan immensely complex spell he said squeakily involving the magical concealment of a secret inside a single living soul the information is hidden inside the chosen person or secret keeper and is henceforth impossible to find unless of course the secret keeper chooses to divulge it as long as the secret keeper refused to speak you know who could search the village where lily and james were staying for years and never find them not even if he had his nose pressed against their sitting room windowso black was the potters secret keeper whispered madam rosmertanaturally said professor mcgonagall james potter told dumbledore that black would die rather than tell where they were that black was planning to go into hiding himself and yet dumbledore remained worried i remember him offering to be the potters secret keeper himselfhe suspected black gasped madam rosmertahe was sure that somebody close to the potters had been keeping you know who informed of their movements said professor mcgonagall darkly indeed he had suspected for some time that someone on our side had turned traitor and was passing a lot of information to you know whobut james potter insisted on using blackhe did said fudge heavily and then barely a week after the fidelius charm had been performed black betrayed them breathed madam rosmertahe did indeed black was tired of his double agent role he was ready to declare his support openly for you know who and he seems to have planned this for the moment of the potters death but as we all knowyou know who met his downfall in little harry potter powers gonehorribly weakened he fled and this left black in a very nasty position indeed his master had fallen at the very moment when he black had shown his true colors as a traitor he had no choice but to run for it filthy stinkin turncoat hagrid said so loudly that half the bar went quietshh said professor mcgonagalli met him growled hagrid i musta bin the last ter see him before he killed all them people it was me what rescued harry from lily an jamess house after they was killed jus got him outta the ruins poor little thing with a great slash across his forehead an his parents dead an sirius black turns up on that flyin motorbike he used ter ride never occurred ter me what he was doin there i didn know hed bin lily an jamess secret keeper thought hed jus heard the news o you know whos attack an come ter see what he could do white an shakin he was an yeh know what i did i comforted the murderin traitor hagrid roaredhagrid please said professor mcgonagall keep your voice downhow was i ter know he wasn upset abou lily an james it was you know who he cared abou an then he says give harry ter mehagrid im his godfather ill look after him ha but id had me orders from dumbledore an i told black no dumbledore said harry was ter go ter his aunt an uncles black argued but in the end he gave in told me ter take his motorbike ter get harry there i wont need it anymore he saysi shoulda known there was somethin fishy goin on then he loved that motorbike what was he givin it ter me for why wouldn he need it anymore fact was it was too easy ter trace dumbledore knew hed bin the potters secret keeper black knew he was goin ter have ter run fer it that night knew it was a matter o hours before the ministry was after himbut what if id given harry to him eh i bet hed ve pitched him offthe bike halfway out ter sea his bes friends son but when a wizard goes over ter the dark side theres nothin and no one that matters to em anymorea long silence followed hagrids story then madam rosmerta said with some satisfaction but he didnt manage to disappear did he the ministry of magic caught up with him next dayalas if only we had said fudge bitterly it was not we who found him it was little peter pettigrew another of the potters friendsmaddened by grief no doubt and knowing that black had been the potters secret keeper he went after black himselfpettigrew that fat little boy who was always tagging around after them at hogwarts said madam rosmertahero worshipped black and potter said professor mcgonagall never quite in their league talent wise i was often rather harp with himyou can imagine how i how i regret that now she sounded as though she had a sudden head coldthere now minerva said fudge kindly pettigrew died a heros death eyewitnesses muggles of course we wiped their memories later told us how pettigrew cornered black they say he was sobbinglily and james sirius how could you and then he went for his wandwell of course black was quicker blew pettigrew to smithereensprofessor mcgonagall blew her nose and said thickly stupid boy foolish boy he was always hopeless at dueling should have left it to the ministryi tell yeh if id got ter black before little pettigrew did i wouldnt ve messed around with wands id ve ripped him limb from limb hagrid growledyou dont know what youre talking about hagrid said fudge sharplynobody but trained hit wizards from the magical law enforcement squad would have stood a chance against black once he was cornered i was junior minister in the department of magical catastrophes at the timeand i was one of the first on the scene after black murdered all thosepeople i i will never forget it i still dream about it sometimes a crater in the middle of the street so deep it had cracked the sewer below bodies everywhere muggles screaming and black standing there laughing with what was left of pettigrew in front of him a heap of bloodstained robes and a few a few fragments fudges voice stopped abruptly there was the sound of five noses being blownwell there you have it rosmerta said fudge thickly black was taken away by twenty members of the magical law enforcement squad and pettigrew received the order of merlin first class which i think was some comfort to his poor mother blades been in azkaban ever sincemadam rosmerta let out a long sighis it true hes mad ministeri wish i could say that he was said fudge slowly i certainly believe his masters defeat unhinged him for a while the murder of pettigrew and all those muggles was the action of a cornered and desperate man cruel pointless yet i met black on my last inspection of azkaban you know most of the prisoners in there sit muttering to themselves in the dark theres no sense in them but i was shocked at how normal black seemed he spoke quite rationally to meit was unnerving youd have thought he was merely bored asked if id finished with my newspaper cool as you please said he missed doing the crossword yes i was astounded at how little effect the dementors seemed to be having on him and he was one of the most heavily guarded in the place you know dementors outside his door day and nightbut what do you think hes broken out to do said madam rosmertagood gracious minister he isnt trying to rejoin you know who is hei daresay that is his er eventual plan said fudge evasivelybut we hope to catch black long before that i must say you know who alone and friendless is one thing but give him back his most devoted servant and i shudder to think how quickly hell rise againthere was a small chink of glass on wood someone had set down their glassyou know cornelius if youre dining with the headmaster hed better head back up to the castle said professor mcgonagallone by one the pairs of feet in front of harry took the weight of their owners once more hems of cloaks swung into sight and madam rosemertas glittering heels disappeared behind the bar the door of the three broomsticks opened again there was another flurry of snow and the teachers had disappearedharryrons and hermiones faces appeared under the table they were both staring at him lost for wordschapter eleven the fireboltharry didnt have a very clear idea of how he had managed to get back into the honeydukes cellar through the tunnel and into the castle once more all he knew was that the return trip seemed to take no time at all and that he hardly noticed what he was doing because his head was still pounding with the conversation he had just heardwhy had nobody ever told him dumbledore hagrid mr weasley cornelius fudge why hadnt anyone ever mentioned the fact that harrys parents had died because their best friend had betrayed themron and herinione watched harry nervously all through dintier not daring to talk about what theyd overheard because percy was sitting close by them when they went upstairs to the crowded common room it was to find fred and george had set off half a dozen dungbombs in a fit of end of term high spirits harry who didnt want fred and george asking him whether hed reached hogsmeade or not sneaked quietly up to the empty dormitory and headed straight for his bedside cabinet he pushed his books aside and quickly found what he was looking for the leather bound photo album hagrid had given him two years ago which wasfull of wizard pictures of his mother and father he sat down on his bed drew the hangings around him and started turning the pagessearching untilhe stopped on a picture of his parents wedding day there was his father waving up at him beaming the untidy black hair harry had inherited standing up in all directions there was his mother alight with happiness arm in arm with his dad and there that must be himtheir best man harry had never given him a thought beforeif he hadnt known it was the same person he would never have guessed it was black in this old photograph his face wasnt sunken and waxybut handsome full of laughter had he already been working for voldemort when this picture had been taken was he already planning the deaths of the two people next to him did he realize he was facing twelve years in azkaban twelve years that would make him unrecognizablebut the dementors dont affect him harry thought staring into the handsome laughing face he doesnt have to hear my min screaming if they get too close harry slammed the album shut reached over and stuffed it back into his cabinet took off his robe and glasses and got into bed making sure the hangings were hiding him from viewthe dormitory door openedharry said rons voice uncertainlybut harry still pretending to be asleep he heard ron leave again and rolled over on his back his eyes wide opena hatred such as he had never known before was coursing through harry like poison he could see black laughing at him through the darkness as though somebody had pasted the picture from the album over his eyes he watched as though somebody was playing him a piece of film sirius black blasting peter pettigrew who resembled neville longbottom into a thousand pieces he could hear though having no idea what blacks voice might sound like a low excited mutter it has happened my lordthe potters have made me their secret keeper and then came another voice laughing shrilly the same laugh that harry heard inside his head whenever the dementors drew nearharry you you look terribleharry hadnt gotten to sleep until daybreak he had awoken to find the dormitory deserted dressed and gone down the spiral staircase to a common room that was completely empty except for ron who was eating a peppermint toad and massaging his stomach and hermione who had spread her homework over three tableswhere is everyone said harrygone its the first day of the holidays remember said ron watching harry closely its nearly lunchtime i was going to come and wake you up in a minuteharry slumped into a chair next to the fire snow was still falling outside the windows crookshanks was spread out in front of the fire like a large ginger rugyou really don look well you know hermione said peering anxiously into his faceim fine said harryharry listen said hermione exchanging a look with ron you must be really upset about what we heard yesterday but the thing is you mustnt go doing anything stupidlike what said harrylike trying to go after black said ron sharplyharry could tell they had rehearsed this conversation while he had been asleep he didnt say anythingyou wont will you harry said hermionebecause blacks not worth dying for said ronharry looked at them they didnt seem to understand at alldyou know what i see and hear every time a dementor gets too near meron and hermione shook their heads looking apprehensive i can hear my mum screaming and pleading with voldemort and if youd heard your mum screaming like that just about to be killed you wouldnt forget it in a hurry and if you found out someone who was supposed to be a friend of hers betrayed her and sent voldemort after her theres nothing you can do said hermione looking stricken the dementors will catch black and hell go back to azkaban and and serve him rightyou heard what fudge said black isnt affected by azkaban like normal people are its not a punishment for him like it is for the othersso what are you saying said ron looking very tense you want to to kill black or somethingdont be silly said herinione in a panicky voice harry doesnt want to kill anyone do you harryagain harry didnt answer he didnt know what he wanted to do all he knew was that the idea of doing nothing while black was at liberty was almost more than he could standmalfoy knows he said abruptly remember what he said to me in potions if it was me id hunt him down myself id want revengeyoure going to take malfoys advice instead of ours said ron furiously listen you know what pettigrews mother got back after black had finished with him dad told me the order of merlin first class and pettigrews finger in a box that was the biggest bit of him they could find blacks a madman harry and hes dangerous malfoys dad must have told him said harry ignoring ron he was right in voldemorts inner circle say you know who will you interjected ron angrilyso obviously the malfoys knew black was working for voldemort and malfoyd love to see you blown into about a million pieces like pettigrew get a grip malfoys just hoping youll get yourself killed before he has to play you at quidditchharry please said hermione her eyes now shining with tears please be sensible black did a terrible terrible thing but d dont put yourself in danger its what black wants oh harry youd be playing right into blacks hands if you went looking for him your mum and dad wouldnt want you to get hurt would they theyd never want you to go looking for blackill never know what theyd have wanted because thanks to black ive never spoken to them said harry shortlythere was a silence in which crookshanks stretched luxuriously flexing his claws rons pocket quiveredlook said ron obviously casting around for a change of subjectits the holidays its nearly christmas lets lets go down and see hagrid we havent visited him for agesno said hermione quickly harry isnt supposed to leave the castleron yeah lets go said harry sitting up and i can ask him how come he never mentioned black when he told me all about my parentsfurther discussion of sirius black plainly wasnt what ron had had in mindor we could have a game of chess he said hastily or gobstones percy left a set no lets visit hagrid said harry firmlyso they got their cloaks from their dormitories and set off through theportrait hole stand and fight you yellow bellied mongrels down through the empty castle and out through the oak front doorsthey made their way slowly down the lawn making a shallow trench in the glittering powdery snow their socks and the hems of their cloaks soaked and freezing the forbidden forest looked as though it had been enchanted each tree smattered with silver and hagrids cabin looked like an iced cakeron knocked but there was no answerhes not out is he said hermione who was shivering under her cloakron had his ear to the doortheres a weird noise he said listen is that fangharry and hermione put their ears to the door too from inside the cabin came a series of low throbbing moansthink wed better go and get someone said ron nervouslyhagrid called harry thumping the door hagrid are you in therethere was a sound of heavy footsteps then the door creaked open hagrid stood there with his eyes red and swollen tears splashing down the front of his leather vestywve heard he bellowed and he flung himself onto harrys neckhagrid being at least twice the size of a normal man this was no laughing matter harry about to collapse under hagrids weight was rescued by ron and hermione who each seized hagrid under an arm and heaved him back into the cabin hagrid allowed himself to be steered into a chair and slumped over the table sobbing uncontrollably his face glazed with tears that dripped down into his tangled beardhagrid what is it said hermione aghastharry spotted an official looking letter lying open on the tablewhats this hagridhagrids sobs redoubled but he shoved the letter toward harry who picked it up and read alouddear mr hagridfurther to our inquiry into the attack by a hippogriff on a student in your class we have accepted the assurances of professor dumbledore that you bear no responsibility for the regrettable incidentwell thats okay then hagrid said ron clapping hagrid oil the shoulder but hagrid continued to sob and waved one of his gigantic hands inviting harry to read onhowever we must register our concern about the hippogriff in questionwe have decided to uphold the official complaint of mr lucius malfoyand this matter will therefore be taken to the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures the hearing will take place on april th and we ask you to present yourself and your hippogriff at the committees offices in london on that date in the meantime the hippogriff should be kept tethered and isolated yours in fellowshipthere followed a list of the school governorsoh said ron but you said buckbeak isnt a bad hippogriff hagrid i bet hell get off yeh don know them gargoyles at the committee fer the disposal o dangerous creatures choked hagrid wiping his eyes on his sleevetheyve got it in fer interestin creaturesa sudden sound from the corner of hagrids cabin made harry ron and hermione whip around buckbeak the hippogriff was lying in the cornerchomping on something that was oozing blood all over the floori couldn leave him tied up out there in the snow choked hagrid all on his own at christmasharry ron and hermione looked at one another they had never seen eye to eye with hagrid about what he called interesting creatures and other people called terrifying monsters or the other hand there didnt seem to be any particular harm in buckbeak in fact by hagrids usual standards he was positively cuteyoull have to put up a good strong defense hagrid said hermionesitting down and laying a hand on hagrids massive forearm im sure you can prove buckbeak is safewont make no diffrence sobbed hagrid

in his armswhat about dumbledore hagrid said harryhes done moren enough fer me already groaned hagrid got enough on his plate what with keepin them dementors outta the castle an sirius black lurkin around ron and hermione looked quickly at harry as though expecting him to start berating hagrid for not telling him the truth about black but harry couldnt bring himself to do it not now that he saw hagrid so miserable and scaredlisten hagrid he said you cant give up hermiones right you just need a good defense you can call us as witnesses im sure ive read about a case of hippogriff baiting said hermione thoughtfully where the hippogriff got off ill look it up for youhagrid and see exactly what happenedhagrid howled still more loudly harry and hermione looked at ron to help themer shall i make a cup of tea said ronharry stared at himits what my mum does whenever someones upset ron mutteredshruggingat last after many more assurances of help with a steaming mug of tea in front of him hagrid blew his nose on a handkerchief the size of a tablecloth and said yer right i can afford to go ter pieces gotta pull meself togetherfang the boarhound came timidly out from under the table and laid his head on hagrids kneeive not bin meself lately said hagrid stroking fang with one hand and mopping his face with the other worried abou buckbeak an no one likin me classes we do like them lied

gotta go inter hidin an an im scared o breakin the law he looked up at them tears leaking down his face again i don ever want ter go back ter azkabanthe trip to hagrids though far from fun had nevertheless had the effect ron and hermione had hoped though harry had by no means forgotten about black he couldnt brood constantly on revenge if he wanted to help hagrid win his case against the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures he ron and hermione went to the library the next day and returned to the empty common room laden with books that might help prepare a defense for buckbeak the three of them sat in front of the roaring fire slowly turning the pages of dusty volumes about famous cases if marauding beasts speaking occasionally when they ran across something relevantheres something there was a case in but the hippogriff was convicted ugh look what they did to it thats disgusting this might help look a manticore savaged someone in and they let the manticore off oh no that was only because everyone wastoo scared to go near itmeanwhile in the rest of the castle the usual magnificent christmas decorations had been put up despite the fact that hardly any of the students remained to enjoy them thick streamers of holly and mistletoe were strung along the corridors mysterious lights shone from inside every suit of armor and the great hall was filled with its usual twelve christmas trees glittering with golden stars a powerful and delicious smell of cooking pervaded the corridors and by christmas eve it had grown so strong that even scabbers poked his nose out of the shelter of rons pocket to sniff hopefully at the airon christmas morning harry was woken by ron throwing his pillow at himoy presentsharry reached for his glasses and put them on squinting through the semi darkness to the foot of his bed where a small heap of parcels had appeared ron was already ripping the paper off his own presentsanother sweater from mum maroon again see if youve got oneharry had mrs weasley had sent him a scarlet sweater with the gryffindor lion knitted on the front also a dozen home baked mince pies some christmas cake and a box of nut brittle as he moved all these things aside he saw a long thin package lying underneathwhats that said ron looking over a freshly unwrapped pair of maroon socks in his handdunnoharry ripped the parcel open and gasped as a magnificent gleaming broomstick rolled out onto his bedspread ron dropped his socks and jumped off his bed for a closer looki dont believe it he said hoarselyit was a firebolt identical to the dream broom harry had gone to see every day in diagon alley its handle glittered as he picked it up hecould feel it vibrating and let go it hung in midair unsupported at exactly the right height for him to mount it his eyes moved from the golden registration number at the top of the handle right down to the perfectly smooth streamlined birch twigs that made up the tailwho sent it to you said ron in a hushed voicelook and see if theres a card said harryron ripped apart the firebolts wrappingsnothing blimey whod spend that much on youwell said harry feeling stunned im betting it wasnt the dursleysi bet it was dumbledore said ron now walking around and around the firebolt taking in every glorious inch he sent you the invisibility cloak anonymouslythat was my dads though said harry dumbledore was just passing it on to me he wouldnt spend hundreds of galleons on me he cant go giving students stuff like this thats why he wouldnt say it was from him said ron in case some git like malfoy said it was favoritism hey harry ron gave a great whoop of laughter malfoy wait till he sees you on this hell be sick as a pig this is an international standard broom this isi cant believe this harry muttered running a hand along the firebolt while ron sank onto harrys bed laughing his head off at the thought of malfoy who i know said ron controlling himself i know who it couldve been lupinwhat said harry now starting to laugh himself lupin listen if he had this much gold hed be able to buy himself some new robesyeah but he likes you said ron and he was away when your nimbusgot smashed and he mightve heard about it and decided to visit diagon alley and get this for you what dyou mean he was away said harry he was ill when i was playing in that matchwell he wasnt in the hospital wing said ron i was there cleaning out the bedpans on that detention from snape rememberharry frowned at roni cant see lupin affording something like thiswhatre you two laughing abouthermione had just come in wearing her dressing gown and carrying crookshanks who was looking very grumpy with a string of tinsel tied around his neckdont bring him in here said ron hurriedly snatching scabbers from the depths of his bed and stowing him in his pajama pocketbut hermione wasnt listening she dropped crookshanks onto seamuss empty bed and stared open mouthed at the fireboltoh harry who sent you thatno idea said harry there wasnt a card or anything with itto his great surprise hermione did not appear either excited or intrigued by the news on the contrary her face fell and she bit her lipwhats the matter with you said roni dont know said hermione slowly but its a bit odd isnt it i mean this is supposed to be quite a good broom isnt itron sighed exasperatedlyits the best broom there is hermione he saidso it mustve been really expensiveprobably cost more than all the slytherins brooms put together said ron happilywell whod send harry something as expensive as that and not even tell him theyd sent it said hermionewho cares said ron impatiently listen harry can i have a go on it can ii dont think anyone should ride that broom just yet said hermione shrillyharry and ron looked at herwhat dyou think harrys going to do with it sweep the floor said ronbut before hermione could answer crookshanks sprang from seamuss bedright at rons chestget him out of here ron bellowed as crookshankss claws ripped his pajamas and scabbers attempted a wild escape over his shoulder ron seized scabbers by the tail and aimed a misjudged kick at crookshanks that hit the trunk at the end of harrys bed knocking it over and causing ron to hop up and down howling with paincrookshankss fur suddenly stood on end a shrill tint whistling was filling the room the pocket sneakoscope had become dislodged from uncle vernons old socks and was whirling and gleaming on the floori forgot about that harry said bending down and picking up the sneakoscope i never wear those socks if i can help itthe sneakoscope whirled and whistled in his palm crookshanks was hissing and spitting at ityoud better take that cat out of here hermione said ron furiouslysitting on harrys bed nursing his toe cant you shut that thing uphe added to harry as hermione strode out of the room crookshankss yellow eyes still fixed maliciously on ronharry stuffed the sneakoscope back inside the socks and threw it back into his trunk all that could be heard now were rons stifled moans of pain and rage scabbers was huddled in rons hands it had been a while since harry had seen him out of rons pocket and he was unpleasantly surprised to see that scabbers once so fat was now very skinny patches of fur seemed to have fallen out too hes not looking too good is he harry saidits stress said ron hed be fine if that big stupid furball left him alonebut harry remembering what the woman at the magical menagerie had said about rats living only three years couldnt help feeling that unless scabbers had powers he had never revealed he was reaching the end of his life and despite rons frequent conplaints that scabbers was both boring and useless he was sure ron would be very miserable if scabbers diedchristmas spirit was definitely thin on the ground in the gryffindor common room that morning hermione had shut crookshanks in her dormitory but was furious with ron for trying to kick him ron was still fuming about crookshankss fresh attempt to eat scabbers harry gave up trying to make them talk to each other and devoted himself to examining the firebolt which he had brought down to the common room with him for some reason this seemed to annoy hermione as well she didnt say anything but she kept looking darkly at the broom as though it too had been criticizing her catat lunchtime they went down to the great hall to find that the house tables had been moved against the walls again and that a single tableset for twelve stood in the middle of the room professors dumbledoremcgonagall snape sprout and flitwick were there along with filchthe caretaker who had taken off his usual brown coat and was wearing a very old and rather moldy looking tailcoat there were only three otherstudents two extremely nervous looking first years and a sullen faced slytherin fifth yearmerry christmas said dumbledore as harry ron and hermione approached the table as there are so few of us it seemed foolish to use the house tables sit down sit downharry ron and hermione sat down side by side at the end of the tablecrackers said dumbledore enthusiastically offering the end of a large silver noisemaker to snape who took it reluctantly and tuggedwith a bang like a gunshot the cracker flew apart to reveal a largepointed witchs hat topped with a stuffed vultureharry remembering the boggart caught rons eye and they both grinned snapes mouth thinned and he pushed the hat toward dumbledore who swapped it for his wizards hat at oncedig in he advised the table beaming aroundas harry was helping himself to roast potatoes the doors of the great hall opened again it was professor trelawney gliding toward them as though on wheels she had put on a green sequined dress in honor of the occasion making her look more than ever like a glittering oversized dragonflysibyll this is a pleasant surprise said dumbledore standing upi have been crystal gazing headmaster said professor trelawney in her mistiest most faraway voice and to my astonishment i saw myself abandoning my solitary luncheon and coming to join you who am i to refuse the promptings of fate i at once hastened from my tower and i do beg you to forgive my latenesscertainly certainly said dumbledore his eyes twinkling let me draw you up a chair and he did indeed draw a chair in midair with his wand which revolved for a few seconds before falling with a thud between professors snape and mcgonagall professor trelawney however did not sit down herenormous eyes had been roving around the table and she suddenly uttered a kind of soft screami dare not headmaster if i join the table we shall be thirteennothing could be more unlucky never forget that when thirteen dine together the first to rise will be the first to diewell risk it sibyll said professor mcgonagall inpatiendy do sit down the turkeys getting stone coldprofessor trelawney hesitated then lowered herself into the empty chair eyes shut and mouth clenched tight as though expecting a thunderbolt to hit the table professor mcgonagall poked a large spoon into the nearest tureentripe sibyllprofessor trelawney ignored her eyes open again she looked around once more and said but where is dear professor lupinim afraid the poor fellow is ill again said dumbledore indicating that everybody should start serving themselves most unfortunate that it should happen on christmas daybut surely you already knew that sibyll said professor mcgonagallher eyebrows raisedprofessor trelawney gave professor mcgonagall a very cold lookcertainly i knew minerva she said quietly but one does not parade the fact that one is all knowing i frequently act as though i am not possessed of the inner eye so as not to make others nervousthat explains a great deal said professor mcgonagall tartlyprofessor trelawneys voice suddenly became a good deal less mistyif you must know minerva i have seen that poor professor lupin will not be with us for very long he seems aware himself that his time is short he positively fled when i offered to crystal gaze for him imagine that said professor mcgonagall drylyi doubt said dumbledore in a cheerful but slightly raised voicewhich put an end to professor mcgonagall and professor trelawneys conversation that professor lupin is in any immediate danger severusyouve made the potion for him againyes headmaster said snape w what said harry scrambling to his feet whyit will need to be checked for jinxes said professor mcgonagall of course im no expert but i daresay madam hooch and professor flitwick will strip it down strip it down repeated ron as though professor mcgonagall was madit shouldnt take more than a few weeks said professor mcgonagallyou will have it back if we are sure it is jinx freetheres nothing wrong with it said harry his voice shaking slightlyhonestly professor you cant know that potter said professor mcgonagall quite kindlynot until youve flown it at any rate and im afraid that is out of the question until we are certain that it has not been tampered with i shall keep you informedprofessor mcgonagall turned on her heel and carried the firebolt out of the portrait hole which closed behind her harry stood staring after her the tin of high finish polish still clutched in his hands ronhowever rounded on hermionewhat did you go running to mcgonagall forhermione threw her book aside she was still pink in the face but stood up and faced ron defiantlybecause i thought and professor mcgonagall agrees with me that that broom was probably sent to harry by sirius blackchapter twelve the patronusharry knew that hermione had meant well but that didnt stop him from being angry with her he had been the owner of the best broom in the world for a few short hours and now because of her interference he didnt know whether he would ever see it again he was positive that there was nothing wrong with the firebolt now but what sort of state would it be in once it had been subjected to all sorts of anti jinx testsron was furious with hermione too as far as he was concerned the stripping down of a brand new firebolt was nothing less than criminal damage hermione who remained convinced that she had acted for the best started avoiding the common room harry and ron supposed she had taken refuge in the library and didnt try to persuade her to come backall in all they were glad when the rest of the school returned shortly after new year and gryffindor tower became crowded and noisy againwood sought harry out on the night before term startedhad a good christmas he said and then without waiting for an answer he sat down lowered his voice and said ive been doing some thinking over christmas harry after last match you know if the dementors come to the next one i mean we cant afford you to well wood broke off looking awkwardim working on it said harry quickly professor lupin said hed train me to ward off the dementors we should be starting this week he said hed have time after christmasah said wood his expression clearing well in that case i really didnt want to lose you as seeker harry and have you ordered a new broom yetno said harrywhat youd better get a move on you know you cant ride that shooting star against ravenclawhe got a firebolt for christmas said rona firebolt no seriously a a real fireboltdont get excited oliver said harry gloomily i havent got it anymore it was confiscated and he explained all about how the firebolt was now being checked for jinxesjinxed how could it be jinxedsirius black harry said wearily hes supposed to be after me so mcgonagall reckons he might have sent itwaving aside the information that a famous murderer was after his seeker wood said but black couldnt have bought a firebolt hes on the run the whole countrys on the lookout for him how could he just walk into quality quidditch supplies and buy a broomsticki know said harry but mcgonagall still wants to strip it down wood went paleill go and talk to her harry he promised ill make her see reason a firebolt a real firebolt on our team she wants gryffindor to win as much as we do ill make her see sense a fireboltclasses started again the next day the last thing anyone felt like doing was spending two hours on the grounds on a raw january morningbut hagrid had provided a bonfire full of salamanders for their enjoyment and they spent an unusually good lesson collecting dry wood and leaves to keep the fire blazing while the flame loving lizards scampered up and down the crumbling white hot logs the first divination lesson of the new term was much less fun professor trelawney was now teaching them palmistry and she lost no time in informing harry that he had the shortest life line she had ever seenit was defense against the dark arts that harry was keen to get to after his conversation with wood he wanted to get started on his anti dementor lessons as soon as possibleah yes said lupin when harry reminded him of his promise at the end of class let me see how about eight oclock on thursday eveningthe history of magic classroom should be large enough ill have to think carefully about how were going to do this we cant bring a real dementor into the castle to practice onstill looks ill doesnt he said ron as they walked down the corridor heading to dinner what dyou reckons the matter with himthere was a loud and impatient tuh from behind them it was hermionewho had been sitting at the feet of a suit of armor repacking her bagwhich was so full of books it wouldnt closeand what are you tutting at us for said ron irritablynothing said hermione in a lofty voice heaving her bag back over her shoulderyes you were said ron i said i wonder whats wrong with lupin and you well isnt it obvious said hermione with a look of maddening superiorityif you dont want to tell us dont snapped ronfine said hermione haughtily and she marched offshe doesnt know said ron staring resentfully after hermione shes just trying to get us to talk to her againat eight oclock on thursday evening harry left gryffindor tower for the history of magic classroom it was dark and empty when he arrivedbut he lit the lamps with his wand and had waited only five minutes when professor lupin turned up carrying a large packing case which he heaved onto professor binns deskwhats that said harryanother boggart said lupin stripping off his cloak ive been combing the castle ever since tuesday and very luckily i found this one lurking inside mr filchs filing cabinet its the nearest well get to a real dementor the boggart will turn into a dementor when he sees you so well be able to practice on him i can store him in my office when were not using him theres a cupboard under my desk hell likeokay said harry trying to sound as though he wasnt apprehensive at all and merely glad that lupin had found such a good substitute for a real dementorso professor lupin had taken out his own wand and indicated that harry should do the same the spell i am going to try and teach you is highly advanced magic harry well beyond ordinary wizarding level it is called the patronus charmhow does it work said harry nervouslywell when it works correctly it conjures up a patronus said lupinwhich is a kind of anti dementor a guardian that acts as a shield between you and the dementorharry had a sudden vision of himself crouching behind a hagridsized figure holding a large club professor lupin continued the patronus is a kind of positive force a projection of the very things that the dementor feeds upon hope happiness the desire to survive but it cannot feel despair as real humans can so the dementors cant hurt itbut i must warn you harry that the charm might be too advanced for you many qualified wizards have difficulty with itwhat does a patronus look like said harry curiouslyeach one is unique to the wizard who conjures itand how do you conjure itwith an incantation which will work only if you are concentratingwith all your might on a single very happy memoryharry cast his mind about for a happy memory certainly nothing that had happened to him at the dursleys was going to do finally he settled on the moment when he had first ridden a broomstickright he said trying to recall as exactly as possible the wonderfulsoaring sensation of his stomachthe incantation is this lupin cleared his throat expecto patronumexpecto patronum harry repeated under his breath expecto patronumconcentrating hard on your happy memoryoh yeah said harry quickly forcing his thoughts back to that first broom ride expecto patrono no patronum sorry expecto patronum expecto patronumsomething whooshed suddenly out of the end of his wand it looked like a wisp of silvery gasdid you see that said harry excitedly something happenedvery good said lupin smiling right then ready to try it on a dementoryes harry said gripping his wand very tightly and moving into the middle of the deserted classroom he tried to keep his mind on flyingbut something else kept intruding any second now he might hear his mother again but he shouldnt think that or he would hear her againand he didnt want to or did helupin grasped the lid of the packing case and pulleda dementor rose slowly from the box its hooded face turned toward harry one glistening scabbed hand gripping its cloak the lamps aroundthe classroom flickered and went out the dementor stepped from the box and started to sweep silently toward harry drawing a deep rattling breath a wave of piercing cold broke over him expecto patronum harry yelled expecto patronum expecto but the classroom and the dementor were dissolving harry was failing again through thick white fog and his mothers voice was louder than ever echoing inside his head not harry not harry please ill do anythingstand aside stand aside girlharryharry jerked back to life he was lying flat on his back on the floorthe classroom lamps were alight again he didnt have to ask what had happenedsorry he muttered sitting up and feeling cold sweat trickling down behind his glassesare you all right said lupinyes harry pulled himself up on one of the desks and leaned against ithere lupin handed him a chocolate frog eat this before we try again i didnt expect you to do it your first time in fact i would have been astounded if you hadits getting worse harry muttered biting off the frogs head i could hear her louder that time and him voldemort lupin looked paler than usual harry if you dont want to continue i will more than understand i do said harry fiercely stuffing the rest of the chocolate frog into his mouth ive got to what if the dementors turn up at our matchagainst ravenclaw i cant afford to fall off again if we lose this game weve lost the quidditch cupall right then said lupin you might want to select other memory a happy memory i mean to concentrate on that one doesnt seem to have been strong enoughharry thought hard and decided his feelings when gryffindor had won the house championship last year had definitely qualified as very happy he gripped his wand tightly again and took up his position in the middle of the classroomready said lupin gripping the box lidready said harry trying hard to fill his head with happy thoughts about gryffindor winning and not dark thoughts about what was going to happen when the box openedgo said lupin pulling off the lid the room went icily cold and dark once more the dementor glided forward drawing its breath one rotting hand was extending toward harry expecto patronum harry yelled expecto patronum expecto pat white fog obscured his senses big blurred shapes were moving around him then came a new voice a mans voice shouting panicking lily take harry and go its him go run ill hold him off the sounds of someone stumbling ftom a room a door bursting open a cackle of high pitched laughter harry harry wake uplupin was tapping harry hard on the face this time it was a minute before harry understood why he was lying on a dusty classroom floori heard my dad harry mumbled thats the first time ive ever heard him he tried to take on voldemort himself to give my mum time to run for itharry suddenly realized that there were tears on his face mingling with the sweat he bent his face as low as possible wiping them off on his robes pretending to do up his shoelace so that lupin wouldnt seeyou heard james said lupin in a strange voiceyeah face dry harry looked up why you didnt know my dad did youi i did as a matter of fact said lupin we were friends at hogwarts listen harry perhaps we should leave it here for tonightthis charm is ridiculously advanced i shoulnt have suggested putting you through thisno said harry he got up again ill have one more go im not thinking of happy enough things thats what it is hang onhe racked his brains a really really happy memory one that he could turn into a good strong patronusthe moment when hed first found out he was a wizard and would be leaving the dursleys for hogwarts if that wasnt a happy memory he didnt know what was concentrating very hard on how he had felt when hed realized hed be leaving privet drive harry got to his feet and faced the packing case once moreready said lupin who looked as though he were doing this against his better judgment concentrating hard all right gohe pulled off the lid of the case for the third time and the dementor rose out of it the room fell cold and dark expecto patronum harry bellowed expecto patronumexpecto patronumthe screaming inside harrys head had started again except this timeit sounded as though it were coming from a badly tuned radio softer and louder and softer again and he could still see the dementor ithad halted and then a huge silver shadow came bursting out of the end of harrys wand to hover between him and the dementor and though harrys legs felt like water he was still on his feet though for how much longer he wasnt sure riddikulus roared lupin springing forwardthere was a loud crack and harrys cloudy patronus vanished along with the dementor he sank into a chair feeling as exhausted as if hed just run a mile and felt his legs shaking out of the corner of his eye he saw professor lupin forcing the boggart back into the packing case with his wand it had turned into a silvery orb againexcellent lupin said striding over to where harry sat excellentharry that was definitely a startcan we have another go just one more gonot now said lupin firmly youve had enough for one night here he handed harry a large bar of honeydukes best chocolateeat the lot or madam pomfrey will be after my blood same time next weekokay said harry he took a bite of the chocolate and watched lupin extinguishing the lamps that had rekindled with the disappearance of the dementor a thought had just occurred to himprofessor lupin he said if you knew my dad you mustve known sirius black as welllupin turned very quicklywhat gives you that idea he said sharplynothing i mean i just knew they were friends at hogwarts toolupins face relaxedyes i knew him he said shortly or i thought i did youd better be off harry its getting lateharry left the classroom walking along the corridor and around a corner then took a detour behind a suit of armor and sank down on its plinth to finish his chocolate wishing he hadnt mentioned black as lupin was obviously not keen on the subject then harrys thoughts wandered back to his mother and fatherhe felt drained and strangely empty even though he was so full of chocolate terrible though it was to hear his parents last moments replayed inside his head these were the only times harry had heard their voices since he was a very small child but hed never be able to produce a proper patronus if he half wanted to hear his parents againtheyre dead he told himself sternly theyre dead and listening to echoes of them wont bring them back youd better get a grip on yourself if you want that quidditch cuphe stood up crammed the last bit of chocolate into his mouth and headed back to gryffindor towerravenclaw played slytherin a week after the start of term slytherin won though narrowly according to wood this was good news for gryffindor who would take second place if they beat ravenclaw too he therefore increased the number of team practices to five a leek this meant that with lupins anti dementor classes which in themselves were more draining than six quidditch practices harry had just one night a week to do all his homework even so he was showing the strain nearly as much as hermione whose immense workload finally seemed to be getting to her every night without fail hermione was to be seen in a corner of the common room several tables spread with books arithmancy chartsrune dictionaries diagrams of muggles lifting heavy objects and file upon file of extensive notes she barely spoke to anybody and snapped when she was interruptedhows she doing it ron muttered to harry one evening as harry sat finishing a nasty essay on undetectable poisons for snape harry looked up hermione was barely visible behind a tottering pile of booksdoing whatgetting to all her classes ron said i heard her talking to professor vector that arithmancy witch this morning they were going on about yesterdays lesson but hermione cant ve been there because she was with us in care of magical creatures and ernie mcmillan told me shes never missed a muggle studies class but half of them are at the same time as divination and shes never missed one of them eitherharry didnt have time to fathom the mystery of hermiones impossible schedule at the moment he really needed to get on with snapes essaytwo seconds later however he was interrupted again this time by woodbad news harry ive just been to see professor mcgonagall about the firebolt she er got a bit shirty with me told m id got my priorities wrong seemed to think i cared more about winning the cup than i do about you staying alive just because i told her i didnt care if it threw you off as long as you caught the snitch first wood shook his head in disbelief honestly the way she was yelling at me youd think id said something terrible then i asked her how much longer she was going to keep it he screwed up his face and imitated professor mcgonagalls severe voice as long as necessary wood i reckon its time you ordered a new broom harry theres an order form at the back of which broomstick you could get a nimbus two thousand and one like malfoys gotim not buying anything malfoy thinks is good said harry flatlyjanuary faded imperceptibly into february with no change in the bitterly cold weather the match against ravenclaw was drawing nearer and nearer but harry still hadnt ordered a new broom he was now asking professor mcgonagall for news of the firebolt after every transfiguration lesson ron standing hopefully at his shoulder hermione rushing past with her face avertedno potter you cant have it back yet professor mcgonagall told him the twelfth time this happened before hed even opened his mouthweve checked for most of the usual curses but professor flitwick believes the broom might be carrying a hurling hex i shall tell youonce weve finished checking it now please stop badgering meto make matters even worse harrys anti dementor lessons were not going nearly as well as he had hoped several sessions on he was able to produce an indistinct silvery shadow every time the boggart dementor approached him but his patronus was too feeble to drive the dementor away all it did was hover like a semitransparent cloud draining harry of energy as he fought to keep it there harry felt angry with himselfguilty about his secret desire to hear his parents voices againyoure expecting too much of yourself said professor lupin sternly in their fourth week of practice for a thirteen year old wizard even an indistinct patronus is a huge achievement you arent passing out anymore are youi thought a patronus would charge the dementors down or somethingsaid harry dispiritedly make them disappear the true patronus does do that said lupin but youve achieved a great deal in a very short space of time if the dementors put in an appearance at your next quidditch match you will be able to keep them at bay long enough to get back to the groundyou said its harder if there are loads of them said harryi have complete confidence in you said lupin smiling here youve earned a drink something from the three broomsticks you wont have tried it before he pulled two bottles out of his briefcasebutterbeer said harry without thinking yeah i like that stufflupin raised an eyebrowoh ron and hermione brought me some back from hogsmeade harry lied quicklyi see said lupin though he still looked slightly suspicious well lets drink to a gryffindor victory against ravenclaw not that imsupposed to take sides as a teacher he added hastily they drank the butterbeer in silence until harry voiced something hed been wondering for a whilewhats under a dementors hoodprofessor lupin lowered his bottle thoughtfullyhmmm well the only people who really know are in no condition to tell us you see the dementor lowers its hood only to use its last and worst weaponwhats thatthey call it the dementors kiss said lupin with a slightly twisted smile its what dementors do to those they wish to destroy utterly i suppose there must be some kind of mouth under there because they clamp their jaws upon the mouth of the victim and and suck out his soulharry accidentally spat out a bit of butterbeerwhat they kill oh no said lupin much worse than that you can exist without your soul you know as long as your brain and heart are still working but youll have no sense of self anymore no memory no anythingtheres no chance at all of recovery youll just exist as an empty shell and your soul is gone forever lostlupin drank a little more butterbeer then said its the fate that awaits sirius black it was in the daily prophet this morning the ministry have given the dementors permission to perform it if they find himharry sat stunned for a moment at the idea of someone having their soul sucked out through their mouth but then he thought of blackhe deserves it he said suddenlyyou think so said lupin lightly do you really think anyone deserves thatyes said harry defiantly for for some thingshe would have liked to have told lupin about the conversation hed overheard about black in the three broomsticks about black betraying his mother and father but it would have involved revealing that hed gone to hogsmeade without permission and he knew lupin wouldnt be very impressed by that so he finished his butterbeer thanked lupin and left the history of magic classroomharry half wished that he hadnt asked what was under a dementors hoodthe answer had been so horrible and he was so lost in unpleasant thoughts of what it would feel like to have your soul sucked out of you that he walked headlong into professor mcgonagall halfway up the stairsdo watch where youre going pottersorry professor ive just been looking for you in the gryffindor common room wellhere it is weve done everything we could think of and there doesnt seem to be anything wrong with it at all youve got a very good friend somewhere potterharrys jaw dropped she was holding out his firebolt and it looked as magnificent as everi can have it back harry said weakly seriouslyseriously said professor mcgonagall and she was actually smiling i daresay youll need to get the feel of it before saturdays match wont you and potter do try and win wont you or well be out of the running for the eighth year in a row as professor snape was kind enough to remind me only last nightspeechless harry carried the firebolt back upstairs toward gryffindor tower as he turned a corner he saw ron dashing toward him grinning from ear to earshe gave it to you excellent listen can i still have a go on ittomorrowyeah anything said harry his heart lighter than it had been in a month you know what we should make up with hermione she was only trying to helpyeah all right said ron shes in the common room how working for a change they turned into the corridor to gryffindor tower and saw neville longbottom pleading with sir cadogan who seemed to be refusing him entrancei wrote them down neville was saying tearfully but i mustve dropped them somewherea likely tale roared sir cadogan then spotting harry and ron good even my fine young yeomen come clap this loon in irons he is trying to force entry to the chambers withinoh shut up said ron as he and harry drew level with nevilleive lost the passwords neville told them miserably i made him tell me what passwords he was going to use this week because he keeps changing them and now i dont know what ive done with themoddsbodikins said harry to sir cadogan who looked extremely disappointed and reluctantly swung forward to let them into the common room there was a sudden excited murmur as every head turned and the next moment harry was surrounded by people exclaiming over his fireboltwhered you get it harrywill you let me have a go have you ridden it yet harryravenclawll have no chance theyre all on cleansweep sevenscan i just hold it harryafter ten minutes or so during which the firebolt was passed around and admired from every angle the crowd dispersed and harry and ron had a clear view of hermione the only person who hadnt rushed over to thembent over her work and carefully avoiding their eyes harry and ron approached her table and at last she looked upi got it back said harry grinning at her and holding up the fireboltsee hermione there wasnt anything wrong with it said ronwell there might have been said hermione i mean at least you know now that its safeyeah i suppose so said harry id better put it upstairsill take it said ron eagerly ive got to give scabbers his rat toniche took the firebolt and holding it as if it were made of glasscarried it away up the boys staircasecan i sit down then harry asked hermionei suppose so said hermione moving a great stack of parchment off a chairharry looked around at the cluttered table at the long arithmancy essay on which the ink was still glistening at the even longer muggle studies essay explain why muggles need electricity and at the rune translation hermione was now poring overhow are you getting through all this stuff harry asked heroh well you know working hard said hermione close up harry saw that she looked almost as tired as lupinwhy dont you just drop a couple of subjects harry asked watchingher lifting books as she searched for her rune dictionaryi couldnt do that said hermione looking scandalizedarithmancy looks terrible said harry picking up a very complicated looking number chartoh no its wonderful said hermione earnestly its my favorite subject its but exactly what was wonderful about arithmancy harry never found outat that precise moment a strangled yell echoed down the boys staircase the whole common room fell silent staring petrified at the entrance then came hurried footsteps growing louder and louder and then ron came leaping into view dragging with him a bedsheetlook he bellowed striding over to hermiones tablelook he yelled shaking the sheets in her faceron what scabbers look scabbershermione was leaning away from ron looking utterly bewildered harry looked down at the sheet ron was holding there was something red on itsomething that looked horribly like blood ron yelled into the stunned silence hes gone and you know what was on the floorn no said hermione in a trembling voiceron threw something down onto hermiones rune translation hermione and harry leaned forward lying on top of the weird spiky shapes were several long ginger cat hairschapter thirteen gryffindor versus ravenclawit looked like the end of ron and hermiones friendship each was so angry with the other that harry couldnt see how theyd ever make upron was enraged that hermione had never taken crookshankss attempts to eat scabbers seriously hadnt bothered to keep a close enough watch on him and was still trying to pretend that crookshanks was innocent by suggesting that ron look for scabbers under all the boys bedshermione meanwhile maintained fiercely that ron had no proof that crookshanks had eaten scabbers that the ginger hairs might have been there since christmas and that ron had been prejudiced against her cat ever since crookshanks had landed on rons head in the magical menageriepersonally harry was sure that crookshanks had eaten scabbers and when he tried to point out to hermione that the evidence all pointed that way she lost her temper with harry toookay side with ron i knew you would she said shrilly first the firebolt now scabbers everythings my fault isnt it just leave me alone harry ive got a lot of work to doron had taken the loss of his rat very hard indeedcome on ron you were always saying how boring scabbers was said fred bracingly and hes been off color for ages he was wasting awayit was probably better for him to snuff it quickly one swallow he probably didnt feel a thingfred said ginny indignantlyall he did was eat and sleep ron you said it yourself said georgehe bit goyle for us once ron said miserably remember harryyeah thats true said harryhis finest hour said fred unable to keep a straight face let the scar on goyles finger stand as a lasting tribute to his memory ohcome on ron get yourself down to hogsmeade and buy a new rat whats the point of moaningin a last ditch attempt to cheer ron up harry persuaded him to come along to the gryffindor teams final practice before the ravenclaw match so that he could have a ride on the firebolt after theyd finished this did seem to take rons mind off scabbers for a moment great can i try and shoot a few goals on it so they set off for the quidditch field togethermadam hooch who was still overseeing gryffindor practices to keep an eye on harry was just as impressed with the firebolt as everyone else had been she took it in her hands before takeoff and gave them the benefit of her professional opinionlook at the balance on it if the nimbus series has a fault its a slight list to the tail end you often find they develop a drag after a few years theyve updated the handle too a bit slimmer than the cleansweeps reminds me of the old silver arrows a pity theyve stopped making them i learned to fly on one and a very fine old broom it was tooshe continued in this vein for some time until wood said er madam hooch is it okay if harry has the firebolt back we need to practiceoh right here you are then potter said madam hooch ill sit over here with weasleyshe and ron left the field to sit in the stadium and the gryffindor team gathered around wood for his final instructions for tomorrows matchharry ive just found out who ravenclaw is playing as seeker its cho chang shes a fourth year and shes pretty good i really hoped she wouldnt be fit shes had some problems with injuries wood scowled his displeasure that cho chang had made a full recovery then said on the other hand she rides a comet two sixty which is going to look like a joke next to the firebolt he gave harrys broom a look of fervent admiration then said okay everyone lets go and at long last harry mounted his firebolt and kicked off from the groundit was better than hed ever dreamed the firebolt turned with the lightest touch it seemed to obey his thoughts rather than his grip it sped across the field at such speed that the stadium turned into a green and gray blur harry turned it so sharply that alicia spinnet screamed then he went into a perfectly controlled dive brushing the grassy field with his toes before rising thirty forty fifty feet into the air againharry im letting the snitch out wood calledharry turned and raced a bludger toward the goal posts he outstripped it easily saw the snitch dart out from behind wood and within ten seconds had caught it tightly in his handthe team cheered madly harry let the snitch go again gave it a minutes head start then tore after it weaving in and out of the others he spotted it lurking near katie bells knee looped her easilyand caught it againit was the best practice ever the team inspired by the presence of the firebolt in their midst performed their best moves faultlessly and by the time they hit the ground again wood didnt have a single criticism to make which as george weasley pointed out was a firsti cant see whats going to stop us tomorrow said wood not unless harry youve sorted out your dementor problem havent youyeah said harry thinking of his feeble patronus and wishing it were strongerthe dementors wont turn up again oliver dumbledored go ballisticsaid fred confidentlywell lets hope not said wood anyway good work everyone lets get back to the tower turn in early im staying out for a bit ron wants a go on the firebolt harry told wood and while the rest of the team headed off to the locker roomsharry strode over to ron who vaulted the barrier to the stands and came to meet him madam hooch had fallen asleep in her seathere you go said harry handing ron the fireboltron an expression of ecstasy on his face mounted the broom and zoomed off into the gathering darkness while harry walked around the edge of the field watching him night had fallen before madam hooch awoke with a start told harry and ron off for not waking her and insisted that they go back to the castleharry shouldered the firebolt and he and ron walked out of the shadowy stadium discussing the firebolts superbly smooth action its phenomenal acceleration and its pinpoint turning they were halfway toward the castle when harry glancing to his left saw something that made his heart turn over a pair of eyes gleaming out of the darknessharry stopped dead his heart banging against his ribswhats the matter said ronharry pointed ron pulled out his wand and muttered lumosa beam of light fell across the grass hit the bottom of a tree and illuminated its branches there crouching among the budding leaves was crookshanksget out of here ron roared and he stooped down and seized a stone lying on the grass but before he could do anything else crookshanks had vanished with one swish of his long ginger tailsee ron said furiously chucking the stone down again shes still letting him wander about wherever he wants probably washing down scabbers with a couple of birds nowharry didnt say anything he took a deep breath as relief seeped through him he had been sure for a moment that those eyes had belongedto the grim they set off for the castle once more slightly ashamed of his moment of panic harry didnt say anything to ron nor did he look left or right until they had reached the well lit entrance hallharry went down to breakfast the next morning with the rest of the boys in his dormitory all of whom seemed to think the firebolt deserved a sort of guard of honor as harry entered the great hall heads turned in the direction of the firebolt and there was a good deal of excited muttering harry saw with enormous satisfaction that the slytherin team were all looking thunderstruckdid you see his face said ron gleefully looking back at malfay he cant believe it this is brilliantwood too was basking in the reflected glory of the fireboltput it here harry he said laying the broom in the middle of the table and carefully turning it so that its name faced upward people from the ravenclaw and hufflepuff tables were soon coming over to lookcedric diggory came over to congratulate harry on having acquired such a superb replacement for his nimbus and percys ravenclaw girlfriendpenelope clearwater asked if she could actually hold the fireboltnow now penny no sabotage said percy heartily as she examined the firebolt closely penelope and i have got a bet on he told the teamten galleons on the outcome of the matchpenelope put the firebolt down again thanked harry and went back to her tableharry make sure you win said percy in an urgent whisper i havent got ten galleons yes im coming penny and he bustled off to join her in a piece of toastsure you can manage that broom potter said a cold drawling voicedraco malfoy had arrived for a closer look crabbe and coyle right behind himyeah reckon so said harry casuallygot plenty of special features hasnt it said malfoy eyes glittering maliciously shame it doesnt come with a parachute in case you get too near a dementorcrabbe and goyle sniggeredpity you cant attach an extra arm to yours malfoy said harry then it could catch the snitch for youthe gryffindor team laughed loudly malfoys pale eyes narrowed and he stalked away they watched him rejoin the rest of the slytherin teamwho put their heads together no doubt asking malfoy whether harrys broom really was a fireboltat a quarter to eleven the gryffindor team set off for the locker rooms the weather couldnt have been more different from their match against hufflepuff it was a clear cool day with a very light breeze there would be no visibility problems this time and harry though nervous was starting to feel the excitement only a quidditch match could bring they could hear the rest of the school moving into the stadium beyond harry took off his black school robes removed his wand from his pocket and stuck it inside the t shirt he was going to wear under his quidditch robes he only hoped he wouldnt need it he wondered suddenly whether professor lupin was in the crowd watchingyou know what weve got to do said wood as they prepared to leave the locker rooms if we lose this match were out of the running just just fly like you did in practice yesterday and well be okaythey walked out onto the field to tumultuous applause the ravenclaw team dressed in blue were already standing in the middle of the fieldtheir seeker cho chang was the only girl on their team she was shorter than harry by about a head and harry couldnt help noticingnervous as he was that she was extremely pretty she smiled at harry as the teams faced each other behind their captains and he felt a slight lurch in the region of his stomach that he didnt think had anything to do with nerveswood davies shake hands madam hooch said briskly and wood shookhands with the ravenclaw captainmount your brooms on my whistle three two one harry kicked off into the air and the firebolt zoomed higher and faster than any other broom he soared around the stadium and began squinting around for the snitch listening all the while to the commentary which was being provided by the weasley twins friend lee jordantheyre off and the big excitement this match is the firebolt that harry potter is flying for gryffindor according to which broomstickthe firebolts going to be the broom of choice for the national teams at this years world championship jordan would you mind telling us whats going on in the matchinterrupted professor mcgonagalls voiceright you are professor just giving a bit of background information the firebolt incidentally has a built in auto brake and jordanokay okay gryffindor in possession katie bell of gryffindor heading for goalharry streaked past katie in the opposite direction gazing around for a glint of gold and noticing that cho chang was tailing him closely she was undoubtedly a very good flier she kept cutting across himforcing him to change directionshow her your acceleration harry fred yelled as he whooshed past in pursuit of a bludger that was aiming for aliciaharry urged the firebolt forward as they rounded the ravenclaw goal posts and cho fell behind just as katie succeeded in scoring the first goal of the match and the gryffindor end of the field went wild he saw it the snitch was close to the ground flitting near one of the barriersharry dived cho saw what he was doing and tore after him harry wasspeeding up excitement flooding him dives were his speciality he was ten feet away then a bludger hit by one of the ravenclaw beaters came pelting out of nowhere harry veered off course avoiding it by an inch and in those few crucial seconds the snitch had vanishedthere was a great ooooooh of disappointment from the gryffindor supporters but much applause for their beater from the ravenclaw endgeorge weasley vented his feelings by hitting the second bludger directly at the offending beater who was forced to roll right over in midair to avoid itgryffindor leads by eighty points to zero and look at that firebolt go potters really putting it through its paces now see it turn changs comet is just no match for it the firebolts precision balance is really noticeable in these long jordan are you being paid to advertise firebolts get on with the commentaryravenclaw was pulling back they had now scored three goals which put gryffindor only fifty points ahead if cho got the snitch before himravenclaw would win harry dropped lower narrowly avoiding a ravenclaw chaser scanning the field frantically a glint of gold a flutter of tiny wings the snitch was circling the gryffindor goal post harry accelerated eyes fixed on the speck of gold ahead but just then cho appeared out of thin air blocking him harry this is no time to be a gentleman wood roared as harry swerved to avoid a collision knock her off her broom if you have toharry turned and caught sight of cho she was grinning the snitch had vanished again harry turned his firebolt upward and was soon twenty feet above the game out of the corner of his eye he saw cho following him shed decided to mark him rather than search for the snitch herself all right then if she wanted to tail him shed have totake the consequenceshe dived again and cho thinking hed seen the snitch tried to follow harry pulled out of the dive very sharply she hurtled downward he rose fast as a bullet once more and then saw it for the third time the snitch was glittering way above the field at the ravenclaw endhe accelerated so many feet below did cho he was winning gaining on the snitch with every second then oh screamed cho pointingdistracted harry looked downthree dementors three tall black hooded dementors were looking up at himhe didnt stop to think plunging a hand down the neck of his robes he whipped out his wand and roared expecto patronumsomething silver white something enormous erupted from the end of his wand he knew it had shot directly at the dementors but didnt pause to watch his mind still miraculously clear he looked ahead he was nearly there he stretched out the hand still grasping his wand and just managed to close his fingers over the small struggling snitchmadam hoochs whistle sounded harry turned around in midair and saw six scarlet blurs bearing down on him next moment the whole team was hugging him so hard he was nearly pulled off his broom down below he could hear the roars of the gryffindors in the crowdthats my boy wood kept yelling alicia angelina and katie had all kissed harry fred had him in a grip so tight harry felt as though his head would come off in complete disarray the team managed to make its way back to the ground harry got off his broom and looked up to see a gaggle of gryffindor supporters sprinting onto the field ron in the lead before he knew it he had been engulfed by the cheering crowdyes ron yelled yanking harrys arm into the air yes yeswell done harry said percy looking delighted ten galleons to memust find penelope excuse me good for you harry roared seamus finniganruddy brilliant boomed hagrid over the heads of the milling gryffindorsthat was quite some patronus said a voice in harrys earharry turned around to see professor lupin who looked both shaken and pleasedthe dementors didnt affect me at all harry said excitedly i didnt feel a thingthat would be because they er werent dementors said professor lupin come and see he led harry out of the crowd until they were able to see the edge of the fieldyou gave mr malfoy quite a fright said lupinharry stared lying in a crumpled heap on the ground were malfoycrabbe goyle and marcus flint the slytherin team captain all struggling to remove themselves from long black hooded robes it looked as though malfoy had been standing on goyles shoulders standing over them with an expression of the utmost fury on her face was professor mcgonagallan unworthy trick she was shouting a low and cowardly attempt to sabotage the gryffindor seeker detention for all of you and fifty points from slytherin i shall be speaking to professor dumbledore about this make no mistake ah here he comes nowif anything could have set the seal on gryffindors victory it was this ron who had fought his way through to harrys side doubled up with laughter as they watched malfoy fighting to extricate himself from the robe goyles head still stuck inside itcome on harry said george fighting his way over party gryffindor common room nowright said harry and feeling happier than he had in ages he and the rest of the team led the way still in their scarlet robes out of the stadium and back up to the castleit felt as though they had already won the quidditch cup the party went on all day and well into the night fred and george weasley disappeared for a couple of hours and returned with armfuls of bottles of butterbeer pumpkin fizz and several bags full of honeydukes sweetshow did you do that squealed angelina johnson as george started throwing peppermint toads into the crowdwith a little help from moony wormtail padfoot and prongs fred muttered in harrys earonly one person wasnt joining in the festivities hermione incrediblywas sitting in a corner attempting to read an enormous book entitled home life and social habits of british muggles harry broke away from the table where fred and george had started juggling butterbeer bottles and went over to herdid you even come to the match he asked herof course i did said hermione in a strangely high pitched voice not looking up and im very glad we won and i think you did really wellbut i need to read this by mondaycome on hermione come and have some food harry said looking over at ron and wondering whether he was in a good enough mood to bury the hatcheti cant harry ive still got four hundred and twenty two pages to read said hermione now sounding slightly hysterical anyway she glanced over at ron too he doesnt want me to join inthere was no arguing with this as ron chose that moment to say loudlyif scabbers hadnt just been eaten he could have had some of those fudge flies he used to really like them hermione burst into tears before harry could say or do anything she tucked the enormous book under her arm and still sobbing ran toward the staircase to the girls dormitories and out of sightcant you give her a break harry asked ron quietlyno said ron flatly if she just acted like she was sorry but shell never admit shes wrong hermione shes still acting like scabbers has gone on vacation or somethingthe gryffindor party ended only when professor mcgonagall turned up in her tartan dressing gown and hair net at one in the morning to insist that they all go to bed harry and ron climbed the stairs to their dormitory still discussing the match at last exhausted harry climbed into bed twitched the hangings of his four poster shut to block out a ray of moonlight lay back and felt himself almost instantly drifting off to sleephe had a very strange dream he was walking through a forest his firebolt over his shoulder following something silvery white it was winding its way through the trees ahead and he could only catch glimpses of it between the leaves anxious to catch up with it he sped up but as he moved faster so did his quarry harry broke into a runand ahead he heard hooves gathering speed now he was running flat outand ahead he could hear galloping then he turned a corner into a clearing and aaarrgghh noooharry woke as suddenly as though hed been hit in the face disoriented in the total darkness he fumbled with his hangings he could hear movements around him and seamus finnigans voice from the other side of the room whats going onharry thought he heard the dormitory door slam at last finding the divide in his curtains he ripped them back and at the same momentdean thomas lit his lampron was sitting up in bed the hangings torn from one side a look of utmost terror on his faceblack sirius black with a knifewhathere just now slashed the curtains woke me upyou sure you werent dreaming ron said deanlook at the curtains i tell you he was herethey all scrambled out of bed harry reached the dormitory door firstand they sprinted back down the staircase doors opened behind them and sleepy voices called after themwho shoutedwhatre you doingthe common room was lit with the glow of the dying fire still littered with the debris from the party it was desertedare you sure you werent dreaming ronim telling you i saw himwhats all the noiseprofessor mcgonagall told us to go to beda few of the girls had come down their staircase pulling or dressing gowns and yawning boys too were reappearingexcellent are we carrying on said fred weasley brightlyeveryone back upstairs said percy hurrying into the common room and pinning his head boy badge to his pajamas as he spokeperce sirius black said ron faintly in our dormitory with a knife woke me upthe common room went very stillnonsense said percy looking startled you had too much to eat ron had a nightmare im telling you now really enoughs enoughprofessor mcgonagall was back she slammed the portrait behind her as she entered the common room and stared furiously aroundi am delighted that gryffindor won the match but this is getting ridiculous percy i expected better of youi certainly didnt authorize this professor said percy puffing himself up indignantly i was just telling them all to get back to bedmy brother ron here had a nightmare it wasnt a nightmare ron yelled professor i woke up and sirius black was standing over me holding a knifeprofessor mcgonagall stared at himdont be ridiculous weasley how could he possibly have gotten through the portrait holeask him said ron pointing a shaking finger at the back of sir cadogans picture ask him if he saw glaring suspiciously at ron professor mcgonagall pushed the portrait back open and went outside the whole common room listened with bated breath sir cadogan did you just let a man enter gryffindor towercertainly good lady cried sir cadoganthere was a stunned silence both inside and outside the common roomyou you did said professor mcgonagall but but the passwordhe had em said sir cadogan proudly had the whole weeks my ladyread em off a little piece of paperprofessor mcgonagall pulled herself back through the portrait hole to face the stunned crowd she was white as chalkwhich person she said her voice shaking which abysmally foolish person wrote down this weeks passwords and left them lying aroundthere was utter silence broken by the smallest of terrified squeaksneville longbottom trembling from head to fluffy slippered toes raised his hand slowly into the airchapter fourteen snapes grudgeno one in gryffindor tower slept that night they knew that the castle was being searched again and the whole house stayed awake in the common room waiting to hear whether black had been caught professor mcgonagall came back at dawn to tell them that he had again escapedthroughout the day everywhere they went they saw signs of tighter security professor flitwick could be seen teaching the front doors to recognize a large picture of sirius black filch was suddenly bustling up and down the corridors boarding up everything from tiny cracks in the walls to mouse holes sir cadogan had been fired his portrait had been taken back to its lonely landing on the seventh floor and the fat lady was back she had been expertly restored but was still extremely nervous and had agreed to return to her job only on condition that she was given extra protection a bunch of surly security trolls had been hired to guard her they paced the corridor in a menacing group talking in grunts and comparing the size of their clubsharry couldnt help noticing that the statue of the one eyed witch on the third floor remained unguarded and unblocked it seemed that fredand george had been right in thinking that they and now harry ronand hermione were the only ones who knew about the hidden passageway within itdyou reckon we should tell someone harry asked ronwe know hes not coming in through honeydukes said ron dismissivelywedve heard if the shop had been broken intoharry was glad ron took this view if the one eyed witch was boarded up too he would never be able to go into hogsmeade againron had become an instant celebrity for the first time in his lifepeople were paying more attention to him than to harry and it was clear that ron was rather enjoying the experience though still severely shaken by the nights events he was happy to tell anyone who asked what had happened with a wealth of detaili was asleep and i heard this ripping noise and i thought it was in my dream you know but then there was this draft i woke up and one side of the hangings on my bed had been pulled down i rolled over and i saw him standing over me like a skeleton with loads of filthy hair holding this great long knife mustve been twelve inches and he looked at me and i looked at him and then i yelledand he scamperedwhy though ron added to harry as the group of secondyear girls who had been listening to his chilling tale departed why did he runharry had been wondering the same thing why had black having got the wrong bed not silenced ron and proceeded to harry black had proved twelve years ago that he didnt mind murdering innocent people and this time he had been facing five unarmed boys four of whom were asleephe mustve known hed have a job getting back out of the castle once youd yelled and woken people up said harry thoughtfully hedve had to kill the whole house to get back through the portrait hole then he would ve met the teachersneville was in total disgrace professor mcgonagall was so furious withhim she had banned him from all future hogsmeade visits given him a detention and forbidden anyone to give him the password into the towerpoor neville was forced to wait outside the common room every night for somebody to let him in while the security trolls leered unpleasantly at him none of these punishments however came close to matching the one his grandmother had in store for him two days after blacks break inshe sent neville the very worst thing a hogwarts student could receive over breakfast a howlerthe school owls swooped into the great hall carrying the mail as usualand neville choked as a huge barn owl landed in front of him a scarlet envelope clutched in its beak harry and ron who were sitting opposite him recognized the letter as a howler at once ron had got one from his mother the year beforerun for it neville ron advisedneville didnt need telling twice he seized the envelope and holding it before him like a bomb sprinted out of the hall while the slytherin table exploded with laughter at the sight of him they heard the howler go off in the entrance hall nevilles grandmothers voice magically magnified to a hundred times its usual volume shrieking about how he had brought shame on the whole familyharry was too busy feeling sorry for neville to notice immediately that he had a letter too hedwig got his attention by nipping him sharply on the wristouch oh thanks hedwigharry tore open the envelope while hedwig helped herself to some of nevilles cornflakes the note inside saiddear harry and ron how abut having tea with me this afternoon round six ill come collect you from the castle wait for me in the entrance hall youre not allowed out on

the top of hagrids wardrobe doorwhat are they for hagrid said harrybuckbeaks case against the committee fer the disposal o dangerous creatures said hagrid this friday him an mell be goin down ter london together ive booked two beds on the knight busharry felt a nasty pang of guilt he had completely forgotten that buckbeaks trial was so near and judging by the uneasy look on rons face he had too they had also forgotten their promise about helping him prepare buckbeaks defense the arrival of the firebolt had driven it clean out of their mindshagrid poured them tea and offered them a plate of bath buns but they knew better than to accept they had had too much experience with hagrids cookingi got somethin ter discuss with you two said hagrid sitting himself between them and looking

up to the castlea large group of people was bunched around the bulletin board when they returned to the common roomhogsmeade next weekend said ron craning over the heads to read the new notice what dyou reckon he added quietly to harry as they went to sit downwell filch hasnt done anything about the passage into honeydukesharry said even more quietlyharry said a voice in his right ear harry started and looked around at hermione who was sitting at the table right behind them and clearing a space in the wall of books that had been hiding herharry if you go into hogsmeade again ill tell professor mcgonagall about that map said hermionecan you hear someone talking harry growled ron not looking at hermioneron how can you let him go with you after what sirius black nearly did to you i

lap hermione took one frightened look at the expression on rons face gathered up crookshanks and hurried away toward the girls dormitoriesso how about it ron said to harry as though there had been no interruption come on last time we went you didnt see anything you havent even been inside zonkos yetharry looked around to check that hermione was well out of earshotokay he said but im taking the invisibility cloak this timeon saturday morning harry packed his invisibility cloak in his bagslipped the marauders map into his pocket and went down to breakfast with everyone else hermione kept shooting suspicious looks down the table at him but he avoided her eye and was careful to let her see him walking back up the marble staircase in the entrance hall as everybody else proceeded to the front doorsbye harry called to ron see you when you get backron grinned and winkedharry hurried up to the third floor slipping the marauders map out of his pocket as he went crouching behind the one eyed witch he smoothed it out a tiny dot was moving in his direction harry squinted at itthe minuscule writing next to it read neville longbottomharry quickly pulled out his wand muttered dissendium and shoved his bag into the statue but before he could climb in himself neville came around the cornerharry i forgot you werent going to hogsmeade eitherhi neville said harry moving swiftly away from the statue and pushing the map back into his pocket what are you up tonothing shrugged neville want a game of exploding snaper not now i was going to go to the library and do that vampire essay for lupin ill come with you said neville brightly i havent done it eitherer hang on yeah i forgot i finished it last nightgreat you can help me said neville his round face anxious i dont understand that thing about the garlic at all do they have to eat itor he broke off with a small gasp looking over harrys shoulderit was snape neville took a quick step behind harryand what are you two doing here said snape coming to a halt and looking from one to the other an odd place to meet to harrys immense disquiet snapes black eyes flicked to the doorways on either side of them and then to the one eyed witchwere not meeting here said harry we just met hereindeed said snape you have a habit of turning up in unexpected places potter and you are very rarely there for no good reason i suggest the pair of you return to gryffindor tower where you belongharry and neville set off without another word as they turned the corner harry looked back snape was running one of his hands over the one eyed witchs head examining it closelyharry managed to shake neville off at the fat lady by telling him the password then pretending hed left his vampire essay in the library and doubling back once out of sight of the security trolls he pulled out the map again and held it close to his nosethe third floor corridor seemed to be deserted harry scanned the map carefully and saw with a leap of relief that the tiny dot labeled severus snape was now back in its officehe sprinted back to the one eyed witch opened her hump heaved himself inside and slid down to meet his bag at the bottom of the stone chutehe wiped the marauders map blank again then set off at a runharry completely hidden beneath the invisibility cloak emerged into the sunlight outside honeydukes and prodded ron in the backits me he mutteredwhat kept you ron hissedsnape was hanging aroundthey set off up the high streetwhere are you ron kept muttering out of the corner of his mouth are you still there this feels weirdthey went to the post office ron pretended to be checking the price of an owl to bill in egypt so that harry could have a good look around the owls sat hooting softly down at him at least three hundred of them from great grays right down to tiny little scops owls local deliveries only which were so small they could have sat in the palm of harrys handthen they visited zonkos which was so packed with students harry had to exercise great care not to tread on anyone and cause a panic there were jokes and tricks to fulfill even freds and georges wildest dreams harry gave ron whispered orders and passed him some gold from under the cloak they left zonkos with their money bags considerably lighter than they had been on entering but their pockets bulging with dungbombs hiccup sweets frog spawn soap and a nose biting teacup apiecethe day was fine and breezy and neither of them felt like staying indoors so they walked past the three broomsticks and climbed a slope to visit the shrieking shack the most haunted dwelling in britain it stood a little way above the rest of the village and even in daylight was slightly creepy with its boarded windows and dank overgrown gardeneven the hogwarts ghosts avoid it said ron as they leaned on the fence looking up at it i asked nearly headless nick he says hes heard a very rough crowd lives here no one can get in fred and george tried obviously but all the entrances are sealed shutharry feeling hot from their climb was just considering taking off the cloak for a few minutes when they heard voices nearby someone was climbing toward the house from the other side of the hill moments later malfoy had appeared followed closely by crabbe and goyle malfoywas speakingshould have an owl from father any time now he had to go to the hearing to tell them about my arm about how i couldnt use it for three monthscrabbe and goyle sniggeredi really wish i could hear that great hairy moron trying to defend himself theres no arm in im onest that hippogriffs as good as dead malfoy suddenly caught sight of ron his pale face split in a malevolent grinwhat are you doing weasleymalfoy looked up at the crumbling house behind ronsuppose youd love to live here wouldnt you weasley dreaming about having your own bedroom i heard your family all sleep in one room is that trueharry seized the back of rons robes to stop him from leaping on malfoyleave him to me he hissed in rons earthe opportunity was too perfect to miss harry crept silently around behind malfoy crabbe and goyle bent down and scooped a large handful of mud out of the pathwe were just discussing your friend hagrid malfoy said to ron just trying to imagine what hes saying to the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures dyou think hell cry when they cut off his hippogriffs splatmalfoys head jerked forward as the mud hit him his silverblond hair was suddenly dripping in muckwhat the ron had to hold onto the fence to keep himself standing he was laughing so hard malfoy crabbe and goyle spun stupidly on the spot staring wildly around malfoy trying to wipe his hair cleanwhat was that who did thatvery haunted up here isnt it said ron with the air of one commenting on the weathercrabbe and goyle were looking scared their bulging muscles were no use against ghosts malfoy was staring madly around at the deserted landscapeharry sneaked along the path where a particularly sloppy puddle yielded some foul smelling green sludgesplattercrabbe and goyle caught some this time goyle hopped furiously on the spot trying to rub it out of his small dull eyesit came from over there said malfoy wiping his face and staring at a spot some six feet to the left of harrycrabbe blundered forward his long arms outstretched like a zombieharry dodged around him picked up a stick and lobbed it at crabbes back harry doubled up with silent laughter as crabbe did a kind of pirouette in midair trying to see who had thrown it as ron was the only person crabbe could see it was ron he started toward but harry stuck out his leg crabbe stumbled and his huge flat foot caught the hem of harrys cloak harry felt a great tug then the cloak slid off his facefor a split second malfoy stared at himaaargh he yelled pointing at harrys head then he turned tail and ran at breakneck speed back down the hill crabbe and goyle behind himharry tugged the cloak up again but the damage was doneharry ron said stumbling forward and staring hopelessly at the point where harry had disappeared youd better run for it if malfoy tells anyone youd better get back to the castle quick see you later said harry and without another word he tore back down the path toward hogsmeadewould malfoy believe what he had seen would anyone believe malfoy nobody knew about the invisibility cloak nobody except dumbledore harrys stomach turned over dumbledore would know exactly what had happened if malfoy said any thing back into honeydukes back down the cellar steps across the stone floor through the trapdoor harry pulled off the cloak tucked it under his arm and ran flat out along the passage malfoy would get back first how long would it take him to find a teacher panting a sharp pain in his side harry didnt slow down until he reached the stone slide he would have to leave the cloak where it was it was too much of a giveaway in case malfoy had tipped off a teacher he hid it in a shadowy corner then started to climb fast as he could his sweaty hands slipping on the sides of the chute he reached the inside of the witchs hump tapped it with his wand stuck his head through and hoisted himself out the hump closed and just as harry jumped out from behind the statue he heard quick footsteps approachingit was snape he approached harry at a swift walk his black robes swishing then stopped in front of himso he saidthere was a look of surpressed triumph about him harry tried to look innocent all too aware of his sweaty face and his muddy hands which he quickly hid in his pocketscome with me potter said snapeharry followed him downstairs trying to wipe his hands clean on theinside of his robes without snape noticing they walked down the stairs to the dungeons and then into snapes officeharry had been in here only once before and he had been in very serious trouble then too snape had aquired a few more slimy horrible things in jars since last time all standing on shelves behind his desk glinting in the firelight and adding to the threatening atmospheresit said snapeharry sat snape however remained standingmr malfoy has just been to see me with a strange story potter said snapeharry didnt say anythinghe tells me that he was up by the shrieking shack when he ran into weasley apparently alonestill harry didnt speakmr malfoy states that he was standing talking to weasley when a large amount of mud hit him in the back of the head how do you think that could have happenedharry tried to look mildly surprisedi dont know professorsnapes eyes were boring into harrys it was exactly like trying to stare down a hippogriff harry tried hard not to blinkmr malfoy then saw an extraordinary apparition can you imagine what it might have been potterno said harry now trying to sound innocently curiousit was your head potter floating in midairthere was a long silencemaybe hed better go to madam pomfrey said harry if hes seeing things like what would your head have been doing in hogsmeade potter said snape softly your head is not allowed in hogsmeade no part of your body has permission to be in hogsmeadei know that said harry striving to keep his face free of guilt or fear it sounds like malfoys having hallucin malfoy is not having hallucinations snarled snape and he bent downa hand on each arm of harrys chair so that their faces were a foot apart if your head was in hogsmeade so was the rest of youive been up in gryffindor tower said harry like you told can anyone confirm thatharry didnt say anything snapes thin mouth curled into a horrible smileso he said straightening up again everyone from the minister of magic downward has been trying to keep famous harry potter safe from sirius black but famous harry potter is a law unto himself let the ordinary people worry about his safety famous harry potter goes where he wants to with no thought for the consequencesharry stayed silent snape was trying to provoke him into telling the truth he wasnt going to do it snape had no proof yethow extraordinarily like your father you are potter snape said suddenly his eyes glinting he too was exceedingly arrogant a small amount of talent on the quidditch field made him think he was a cut above the rest of us too strutting around the place with his friends and admirers the resemblance between you is uncannymy dad didnt strut said harry before he could stop himself and neither do iyour father didnt set much store by rules either snape went onpressing his advantage his thin face full of malice rules were for lesser mortals not quidditch cup winners his head was so swollen shut upharry was suddenly on his feet rage such as he had not felt since his last night in privet drive was coursing through him he didnt care that snapes face had gone rigid the black eyes flashing dangerouslywhat did you say to me potteri told you to shut up about my dad harry yelled i know the truthall right he saved your life dumbledore told me you wouldnt even be here if it wasnt for my dadsnapes sallow skin had gone the color of sour milkand did the headmaster tell you the circumstances in which your father saved my life he whispered or did he consider the details too unpleasant for precious potters delicate earsharry bit his lip he didnt know what had happened and didnt want to admit it but snape seemed to have guessed the truthi would hate for you to run away with a false idea of your fatherpotter he said a terrible grin twisting his face have you been imagining some act of glorious heroism then let me correct you your saintly father and his friends played a highly amusing joke on me that would have resulted in my death if your father hadnt got cold feet at the last moment there was nothing brave about what he did he was saving his own skin as much as mine had their joke succeeded he would have been expelled from hogwartssnapes uneven yellowish teeth were baredturn out your pockets potter he spat suddenlyharry didnt move there was a pounding in his earsturn out your pockets or we go straight to the headmaster pull them out pottercold with dread harry slowly pulled out the bag of zonkos tricks and the marauders mapsnap picked up the zonkos bagron gave them to me said harry praying hed get a chance to tip ron off before snape saw him he brought them back from hogsmeade last time indeed and youve been carrying them around ever since how very touching and what is thissnape had picked up the map harry tried with all his might to keep his face impassivespare bit of parchment he said with a shrugsnape turned it over his eyes on harrysurely you dont need such a very old piece of parchment he saidwhy dont i just throw this awayhis hand moved toward the fireno harry said quicklyso said snape his long nostrils quivering is this another treasured gift from mr weasley or is it something else a letterperhaps written in invisible ink or instructions to get into hogsmeade without passing the dementorsharry blinked snapes eyes gleamedlet me see let me see he muttered taking out his wand and smoothing the map out on his desk reveal your secret he said touching the wand to the parchmentnothing happened harry clenched his hands to stop them from shakingshow yourself snape said tapping the map sharplyit stayed blank harry was taking deep calming breathsprofessor severus snape master of this school commands you to yield the information you conceal snape said hitting the map with his wandas though an invisible hand were writing upon it words appeared on the smooth surface of the mapmooney presents his compliments to professor snape and begs him to keep his abnormally large nose out of other peoples businesssnape froze harry stared dumbstruck at the message but the map didnt stop there more writing was appearing beneath the firstmr prongs agrees with mr moony and would like to add that professor snape is an ugle gitit would have been very funny if the situation hadnt been so seriousand there was moremr padfoot would like to register his astonishment that an idiot like that ever became a professorharry closed his eyes in horror when hed opened them the map had had its last wordmr wormtail bids professor snape good day and advises him to wash his hair the slimeballharry waited for the blow to fallso said snape softly well see about thishe strode across to his fire seized a fistful of glittering powder from a jar on the fireplace and threw it into the flameslupin snape called into the fire i want a wordutterly bewildered harry stared at the fire a large shape had appeared in it revolving very fast seconds later professor lupin was clambering out of the fireplace brushing ash off his shabby robesyou called severus said lupin mildlyi certainly did said snape his face contorted with fury as he strode back to his desk i have just asked potter to empty his pockets he was carrying thissnape pointed at the parchment on which the words of messrs moonywormtail padfoot and prongs were still shining an odd closed expression appeared on lupins facewell said snapelupin continued to stare at the map harry had the impression that lupin was doing some very quick thinkingwell said snape again this parchment is plainly full of dark magicthis is supposed to be your area of expertise lupin where do you imagine potter got such a thinglupin looked up and by the merest half glance in harrys directionwarned him not to interruptfull of dark magic he repeated mildly do you really think soseverus it looks to me as though it is merely a piece of parchment that insults anybody who reads it childish but surely not dangerous i imagine harry got it from a joke shop indeed said snape his jaw had gone rigid with anger you think a joke shop could supply him with such a thing you dont think it more likely that he got it directly from the manufacturersharry didnt understand what snape was talking about nor apparentlydid lupinyou mean by mr wormtail or one of these people he said harry do you know any of these menno said harry quicklyyou see severus said lupin turning back to snape it looks like a zonko product to me right on cue ron came bursting into the office he was completely out of breath and stopped just short of snapes desk clutching the stitch in his chest and trying to speaki gave harry that stuff he choked bought it in zonkos ages agowell said lupin clapping his hands together and looking around cheerfully that seems to clear that up severus ill take this backshall i he folded the map and tucked it inside his robes harry roncome with me i need a word about my vampire essay excuse us severus harry didnt dare look at snape as they left his office he ron and lupin walked all the way back into the entrance hall before speakingthen harry turned to lupinprofessor i i dont want to hear explanations said lupin shortly he glanced around the empty entrance hall and lowered his voice i happen to know that this map was confiscated by mr filch many years ago yes i know it s a map he said as harry and ron looked amazed i dont want to know how it fell into your possession i am however astounded that you didnt hand it in particularly after what happened the last time a student left information about the castle lying around and i cant let you have it back harryharry had expected that and was too keen for explanations to protestwhy did snape think id got it from the manufacturersbecause lupin hesitated because these mapmakers would have wanted to lure you out of school theyd think it extremely entertainingdo you know them said harry impressedweve met he said shortly he was looking at harry more seriously than ever beforedont expect me to cover up for you again harry i cannot make you take sirius black seriously but i would have thought that what you have heard when the dementors draw near you would have had more of an effect on you your parents gave their lives to keep you alive harry a poor way to repay them gambling their sacrifice for a bag of magic trickshe walked away leaving harry feeling worse by far than he had at any point in snapes office slowly he and ron mounted the marble staircase as harry passed the one eyed witch he remembered the invisibility cloak it was still down there but he didnt dare go and get itits my fault said ron abruptly i persuaded you to go lupins right it was stupid we shouldntve done it he broke off they reached the corridor where the security trolls were pacing and hermione was walking toward them one look at her face convinced harry that she had heard what had happened his heart plummeted had she told professor mcgonagallcome to have a good gloat said ron savagely as she stopped in front of them or have you just been to tell on usno said hermione she was holding a letter in her hands and her lip was trembling i just thought you ought to know hagrid lost his case buckbeak is going to be executedchapter fifteen the quidditch finalhe sent me this hermione said holding out the letterharry took it the parchment was damp and enormous teardrops had smudged the ink so badly in places that it was very difficult to readdear hermione we lost im allowed to bring him back to hogwartsexecution date to be fixed beaky has enjoyed london i wont forget all the help you gave ushagrid they cant do this said harry they cant buckbeak isnt dangerousmalfoys dads frightened the committee into it said hermione wiping her eyes you know what hes like theyre a bunch of doddery old fools and they were scared therell be an appeal though there always is only i cant see any hope nothing will have changedyeah it will said ron fiercely you wont have to do all the work alone this time hermione ill helpoh ronhermione flung her arms around rons neck and broke down completelyron looking quite terrified patted her very awkwardly on the top of the head finally hermione drew awayron im really really sorry about scabbers she sobbedoh well he was old said ron looking thoroughly relieved that she had let go of him and he was a bit useless you never know mum and dad might get me an owl nowthe safety measures imposed on the students since blacks second break in made it impossible for harry ron and hermione to go and visit hagrid in the evenings their only chance of talking to him was during care of magical creatures lessonshe seemed numb with shock at the verdictsall my fault got all tongue tied they was all sittin there in black robes an i kep droppin me notes and forgettin all them dates yeh looked up fer me hermione an then lucius malfoy stood up an said his bit and the committee jus did exacly what he told emtheres still the appeal said ron fiercely dont give up yet were working on itthey were walking back up to the castle with the rest of the classahead they could see malfoy who was walking with crabbe and goyle and kept looking back laughing derisivelysno good ron said hagrid sadly as they reached the castle stepsthat committees in lucius malfoys pocket im jus gonna make sure the rest o beakys time is the happiest hes ever had i owe him thathagrid turned around and hurried back toward his cabin his face buried in his handkerchieflook at him blubbermalfoy crabbe and goyle had been standing just inside the castle doors listeninghave you ever seen anything quite as pathetic said malfoy and hes supposed to be our teacherharry and ron both made furious moves toward malfoy but hermione got there first smackshe had slapped malfoy across the face with all the strength she could muster malfoy staggered harry ron crabbe and goyle stood flabbergasted as hermione raised her hand againdont you dare call hagrid pathetic you foul you evil hermione said ron weakly and he tried to grab her hand as she swungit backget off ronhermione pulled out her wand malfoy stepped backward crabbe and goyle looked at him for instructions thoroughly bewilderedcmon malfoy muttered and in a moment all three of them had disappeared into the passageway to the dungeonshermione ron said again sounding both stunned and irnpressedharry youd better beat him in the quidditch final hermione said shrilly you just better had because i cant stand it if slytherin winswere due in charms said ron still goggling at hermione wed better gothey hurried up the marble staircase toward professor flitwicks classroomyoure late boys said professor flitwick reprovingly as harry opened the classroom door come along quickly wands out were experimenting with cheering charms today weve already divided into pairs harry and ron hurried to a desk at the back and opened their bags ron looked behind himwheres hermione goneharry looked around too hermione hadnt entered the classroom yet harry knew she had been right next to him when he had opened the doorthats weird said harry staring at ron maybe maybe she went to the bathroom or somethingbut hermione didnt turn up all lessonshe couldve done with a cheering charm on her too said ron as theclass left for lunch all grinning broadly the cheering charms had left them with a feeling of great contentmenthermione wasnt at lunch either by the time they had finished their apple pie the after effects of the cheering charms were wearing offand harry and ron had started to get slightly worriedyou dont think malfoy did something to her ron said anxiously as they hurried upstairs toward gryffindor towerthey passed the security trolls gave the fat lady the password flibbertigibbet and scrambled through the portrait hole into the common roomhermione was sitting at a table fast asleep her head resting on an open arithmancy book they went to sit down on either side of her harry prodded her awakewh what said hermione waking with a start and staring wildly around is it time to go w which lesson have we got nowdivination but its not for another twenty minutes said harryhermione why didnt you come to charmswhat oh no hermione squeaked i forgot to go to charmsbut how could you forget said harry you were with us till we were right outside the classroomi dont believe it hermione wailed was professor flitwick angryoh it was malfoy i was thinking about him and i lost track of thingsyou know what hermione said ron looking down at the enormous arithmancy book hermione had been using as a pillow i reckon youre cracking up youre trying to do too muchno im not said hermione brushing her hair out of her eyes and staring hopelessly around for her bag i just made a mistake thats all id better go and see professor flitwick and say sorry ill see you in divinationhermione joined them at the foot of the ladder to professor trelawneys classroom twenty minutes later looking extremely harrassedi cant believe i missed cheering charms and i bet they come up in our exams professor flitwick hinted they mighttogether they climbed the ladder into the dim stifling tower roomglowing on every little table was a crystal ball full of pearly white mist harry ron and hermione sat down together at the same rickety tablei thought we werent starting crystal balls until next term ron muttered casting a wary eye around for professor trelawney in case she was lurking nearbydont complain this means weve finished palmistry harry muttered back i was getting sick of her flinching every time she looked at my handsgood day to you said the familiar misty voice and professor trelawney made her usual dramatic entrance out of the shadows parvati and lavender quivered with excitement their faces lit by the milky glow of their crystal balli have decided to introduce the crystal ball a little earlier than i had planned said professor trelawney sitting with her back to the fire and gazing around the fates have informed me that your examination in june will concern the orb and i am anxious to give you sufficient practicehermione snortedwell honestly the fates have informed her who sets the exam she does what an amazing prediction she said not troubling to keep her voice low harry and ron choked back laughsit was hard to tell whether professor trelawney had heard them as her face was hidden in shadow she continued however as though she had notcrystal gazing is a particularly refined art she said dreamily i do not expect any of you to see when first you peer into the orbs infinite depths we shall start by practicing relaxing the conscious mind and external eyes ron began to snigger uncontrollably and had to stuff his fist in his mouth to stifle the noise so as to clear the inner eye and the superconscious perhaps if we are lucky some of you will see before the end of the classand so they began harry at least felt extremely foolish staring blankly at the crystal ball trying to keep his mind empty when thoughts such as this is stupid kept drifting across it it didnt help that ron kept breaking into silent giggles and hermione kept tuttingseen anything yet harry asked them after a quarter of an hours quiet crystal gazingyeah theres a burn on this table said ron pointing someones spilled their candlethis is such a waste of time hermione hissed i could be practicing something useful i could be catching up on cheering charms professor trelawney rustled pastwould anyone like me to help them interpret the shadowy portents within their orb she murmured over the clinking of her banglesi dont need help ron whispered its obvious what this meanstheres going to be loads of fog tonightboth harry and hermione burst out laughingnow really said professor trelawney as everyones heads turned in their direction parvati and lavender were looking scandalized you are disturbing the clairvoyant vibrations she approached their table and peered into their crystal ball harry felt his heart sinking he was sure he knew what was coming there is something here professor trelawney whispered lowerng herface to the ball so that it was reflected twice in her huge glassessomething moving but what is itharry was prepared to bet everything he owned including his fireboltthat it wasnt good news whatever it was and sure enough my dear professor trelawney breathed gazing up at harry it is hereplainer than ever before my dear stalking toward you growing ever closer the gr oh for goodness sake said hermione loudly not that ridiculous grim againprofessor trelawney raised her enormous eyes to hermiones face parvati whispered something to lavender and they both glared at hermione tooprofessor trelawney stood up surveying hermione with unmistakable angeri am sorry to say that from the moment you have arrived in this class my dear it has been apparent that you do not have what the noble art of divination requires indeed i dont remember ever meeting a student whose mind was so hopelessly mundanethere was a moments silence then fine said hermione suddenly getting up and cramming unfogging the future back into her bag fine she repeated swinging the bag over her shoulder and almost knocking ron off his chair i give up im leavingand to the whole classs amazement hermione strode over to the trapdoor kicked it open and climbed down the ladder out of sightit took a few minutes for the class to settle down again professor trelawney seemed to have forgotten all about the grim she turned abruptly from harry and rons table breathing rather heavily as she tugged her gauzy shawl more closely to herooooo said lavender suddenly making everyone start oooooprofessor trelawney ive just remembered you saw her leaving didntyou didnt you professor around easter one of our number will leave us forever you said it ages ago professorprofessor trelawney gave her a dewy smileyes my dear i did indeed know that miss granger would be leaving usone hopes however that one might have mistaken the signs the inner eye can be a burden you knowlavender and parvati looked deeply impressed and moved over so that professor trelawney could join their table insteadsome day hermiones having eh ron muttered to harry looking awedyeahharry glanced into the crystal ball but saw nothing but swirling white mist had professor trelawney really seen the grim again would he the last thing he needed was another near fatal accident with the quidditch final drawing ever nearerthe easter holidays were not exactly relaxing the third years had never had so much homework neville longbottom seemed close to a nervous collapse and he wasnt the only onecall this a holiday seamus finnigan roared at the common room one afternoon the exams are ages away whatre they playing atbut nobody had as much to do as hermione even without divination she was taking more subjects than anybody else she was usually last to leave the common room at night first to arrive at the library the next morning she had shadows like lupins under her eyes and seemed constantly close to tearsron had taken over responsibility for buckbeaks appeal when he wasnt doing his own work he was poring over enormously thick volumes with names like the handbook of hippogriff psychology and fowl or foul a study of hippogriff brutality he was so absorbed he even forgot to be horrible to crookshanksharry meanwhile had to fit in his homework around quidditch practice every day not to mention endless discussions of tactics with wood the gryffindor slytherin match would take place on the first saturday after the easter holidays slytherin was leading the tournament by exactly two hundred points this meant as wood constantly reminded his team that they needed to win the match by more than that amount to win the cup it also meant that the burden of winning fell largely on harry because capturing the snitch was worth one hundred and fifty pointsso you must catch it only if were more than fifty points up wood told harry constantly only if were more than fifty points up harryor we win the match but lose the cup youve got that havent you you must catch the snitch only if were i know oliver harry yelledthe whole of gryffindor house was obsessed with the coming matchgryffindor hadnt won the quidditch cup since the legendary charlie weasley rons second oldest brother had been seeker but harry doubted whether any of them even wood wanted to win as much as he did the enmity between harry and malfoy was at its highest point ever malfoy was still smarting bout the mud throwing incident in hogsmeade and was even more furious that harry had somehow wormed his way out of punishment harry hadnt forgotten malfoys attempt to sabotage him in the match against ravenclaw but it was the matter of buckbeak that made him most determined to beat malfoy in front of the entire schoolnever in anyones memory had a match approached in such a highly charged atmosphere by the time the holidays were over tension between the two teams and their houses was at the breaking point a number of small scuffles broke out in the corridors culminating in a nasty incident in which a gryffindor fourth year and a slytherin sixth year ended up in the hospital wing with leeks sprouting out of their earsharry was having a particularly bad time of it he couldnt walk to class without slytherins sticking out their legs and trying to trip him up crabbe and goyle kept popping up wherever he went and slouching away looking disappointed when they saw him surrounded by people wood had given instructions that harry should be accompanied everywhere he went in case the slytherins tried to put him out of action the wholeof gryffindor house took up the challenge enthusiastically so that it was impossible for harry to get to classes on time because he was surrounded by a vast chattering crowd harry was more concerned for his firebolts safety than his own when he wasnt flying it he locked it securely in his trunk and frequently dashed back up to gryffindor tower at break times to check that it was still thereall usual pursuits were abandoned in the gryffindor common room the night before the match even hermione had put down her booksi cant work i cant concentrate she said nervouslythere was a great deal of noise fred and george weasley were dealing with the pressure by being louder and more exuberant than ever oliver wood was crouched over a model of a quidditch field in the cornerprodding little figures across it with his wand and muttering to himself angelina alicia and katie were laughing at freds and georges jokesharry was sitting with ron and hermione removed from the center of things trying not to think about the next day because every time he did he had the horrible sensation that something very large was fighting to get out of his stomachyoure going to be fine hermione told him though she looked positively terrifiedyouve got a firebolt said ronyeah said harry his stomach writhingit came as a relief when wood suddenly stood up and yelled team bedharry slept badly first he dreamed that he had overslept and that wood was yelling where were you we had to use neville instead then he dreamed that malfoy and the rest of the slytherin team arrived for the match riding dragons he was flying at breakneck speed trying to avoid a spurt of flames from malfoys steeds mouth when he realized he had forgotten his firebolt he fell through the air and woke with a startit was a few seconds before harry remembered that the match hadnt taken place yet that he was safe in bed and that the slytherin teamdefinitely wouldnt be allowed to play on dragons he was feeling very thirsty quietly as he could he got out of his four poster and went to pour himself some water from the silver jug beneath the windowthe grounds were still and quiet no breath of wind disturbed the treetops in the forbidden forest the whomping willow was motionless and innocent looking it looked as though the conditions for the match would be perfectharry set down his goblet and was about to turn back to his bed when something caught his eye an animal of some kind was prowling across the silvery lawnharry dashed to his bedside table snatched up his glasses and put them on then hurried back to the window it couldnt be the grim not now not right before the match he peered out at the grounds again and after a minutes frantic searching spotted it it was skirting the edge of the forest now it wasnt the grim at all it was a cat harry clutched the window ledge in relief as he recognized the bottlebrush tail it was only crookshanksor was it only crookshanks harry squinted pressing his nose flat against the glass crookshanks seemed to have come to a halt harry was sure he could see something else moving in the shadow of the trees tooand just then it emerged a gigantic shaggy black dog moving stealthily across the lawn crookshanks trotting at its side harry stared what did this mean if crookshanks could see the dog as wellhow could it be an omen of harrys deathron harry hissed ron wake uphuhi need you to tell me if you can see somethingsall dark harry ron muttered thickly whatre you or aboutdown here harry looked quickly back out of the windowcrookshanks and the dog had vanished harry climbed onto the windowsill to look right down into the shadows of the castle but they werent there where had they gonea loud snore told him ron had fallen asleep againharry and the rest of the gryffindor team entered the great hall the next day to enormous applause harry couldnt help grinning broadly as he saw that both the ravenclaw and hufflepuff tables were applauding them too the slytherin table hissed loudly as they passed harry noticed that malfoy looked even paler than usualwood spent the whole of breakfast urging his team to eat while touching nothing himself then he hurried them off to the field before anyone else had finished so they could get an idea of the conditions as they left the great hall everyone applauded againgood luck harry called cho harry felt himself blushingokay no wind to speak of suns a bit bright that could impair your vision watch out for it grounds fairly hard good thatll give us a fast kickoff wood paced the field staring around with the team behind him finallythey saw the front doors of the castle open in the distance and the rest of the school spilling onto the lawnlocker rooms said wood terselynone of them spoke as they changed into their scarlet robes harry wondered if they were feeling like he was as though hed eaten something extremely wriggly for breakfast in what seemed like no time at all wood was saying okay its time lets go they walked out onto the field to a tidal wave of noise threequarters of the crowd was wearing scarlet rosettes waving scarlet flags with thegryffindor lion upon them or brandishing banners with slogans like go gryffindor and lions for the cuk behind the slytherin goal postshowever two hundred people were wearing green the silver serpent of slytherin glittered on their flags and professor snape sat in the very front row wearing green like everyone else and a very grim smileand here are the gryffindors yelled lee jordan who was acting as commentator as usual potter bell johnson spinnet weasley weasleyand wood widely acknowledged as the best team hogwarts has seen in a good few years lees comments were drowned by a tide of boos from the slytherin endand here come the slytherin team led by captain flint hes made some changes in the lineup and seems to be going for size rather than skill more boos from the slytherin crowd harry however thought lee had a point malfoy was easily the smallest person on the slytherin team the rest of them were enormouscaptains shake hands said madam hoochflint and wood approached each other and grasped each others hand very tightly it looked as though each was trying to break the others fingersmount your brooms said madam hooch three two onethe sound of her whistle was lost in the roar from the crowd as fourteen brooms rose into the air harry felt his hair fly back off his forehead his nerves left him in the thrill of the flight he glanced around saw malfoy on his tail and sped off in search of the snitchand its gryffindor in possession alicia spinner of gryffindor with the quaffle heading straight for the slytherin goal posts looking good alicia argh no quaffle intercepted by warrington warrington of slytherin tearing up the field wham nice bludger work there by george weasley warrington drops the quaffle its caught by johnsongryffindor back in possession come on angelina nice swerve

ouchangelina was nearly thrown from her broom as marcus flint went smashing into hersorry said flint as the crowd below booed sorry didnt see hera moment later fred weasley chucked his beaters club at the back of flints head flints nose smashed into the handle of his broom and began to bleedthat will do shrieked madam hooch zooming between then penalty shot to gryffindor for an unprovoked attack on their chaser penalty shot to slytherin for deliberate damage to their chasercome off it miss howled fred but madam hooch blew her whistle and alicia flew forward to take the penaltycome on alicia yelled lee into the silence that had descended on the crowd yes shes beaten the keeper twenty zero to gryffindorharry turned the firebolt sharply to watch flint still bleeding freelyfly forward to take the slytherin penalty wood was hovering in front of the gryffindor goal posts his jaw clenchedcourse woods a superb keeper lee jordan told the crowd as flint waited for madam hoochs whistle superb very difficult to pass very difficult indeed yes i dont believe it hes saved itrelieved harry zoomed away gazing around for the snitch but still making sure he caught every word of lees commentary it was essential that he hold malfoy off the snitch until gryffindor was more than fifty points up gryffindor in possession no slytherin in possession nogryffindor back in possession and its katie bell katie bell for gryffindor with the quaffle shes streaking up the field that was deliberatemontague a slytherin chaser had swerved in front of katie and instead of seizing the quaffle had grabbed her head katie cart wheeled in the air managed to stay on her broom but dropped the quafflemadam hoochs whistle rang out again as she soared over to montague and began shouting at him a minute later katie had put another penalty past the slytherin seekerthirty zero take that you dirty cheating jordan if you cant commentate in an unbiased way im telling it like it is professorharry felt a huge jolt of excitement he had seen the snitch it was shimmering at the foot of one of the gryffindor goal posts but he mustnt catch it yet and if malfoy saw it faking a look of sudden concentration harry pulled his firebolt around and sped off toward the slytherin end it worked malfoy went haring after him clearly thinking harry had seen the snitch therewhooshone of the bludgers came streaking past harrys right ear hit by the gigantic slytherin beater derrick then again whooshthe second bludger grazed harrys elbow the other beater bole was closing inharry had a fleeting glimpse of bole and derrick zooming toward himclubs raised he turned the firebolt upward at the last second and bole and derrick collided with a sickening crunchha haaa yelled lee jordan as the slytherin beaters lurched away from each other clutching their heads too bad boys youll need to get up earlier than that to beat a firebold and its gryffindor in possession again as johnson takes the quaffle flint alongside her poke him in the eye angelina it was a joke professor it was a joke oh no flint in possession flint flying toward the gryffindor goal posts come on now wood save but flint had scored there was an eruption of cheers from the slytherin end and lee swore so badly that professor mcgonagall tried to tug the magical megaphone away from himsorry professor sorry woia happen again so gryffindor in the leadthirty points to ten and gryffindor in possession it was turning into the dirtiest game harry had ever played in enraged that gryffindor had taken such an early lead the slytherins were rapidly resorting to any means to take the quaffle bole hit alicia with his club and tried to say hed thought she was a bludger george weasley elbowed bole in the face in retaliation madam hooch awarded both teams penalties and wood pulled off another spectacular save making the score forty ten to gryffindorthe snitch had disappeared again malfoy was still keeping close to harry as he soared over the match looking around for it once gryffindor was fifty points ahead katie scored fifty ten fred and george weasley were swooping around her clubs raised in case any of the slytherins were thinking of revenge bole and derrick took advantage of freds and georges absence to aim both bludgers at wood they caught him in the stomach one after the other and he rolled over in the air clutching his broomcompletely windedmadam hooch was beside herselfyou do not attack the keeper unless the quaffle is within the scoring area she shrieked at bole and derrick gryffindor penaltyand angelina scored sixty ten moments later fred weasley pelted a bludger at warrington knocking the quaffle out of his hands alicia seized it and put it through the slytherin goal seventy tenthe gryffindor crowd below was screaming itself hoarse gryffindor was sixty points in the lead and if harry caught the snitch now the cup was theirs harry could almost feel hundreds of eyes following him as he soared around the field high above the rest of the game with malfoy speeding along behind himand then he saw it the snitch was sparkling twenty feet above himharry put on a huge burst of speed the wind was roaring in his ears he stretched out his hand but suddenly the firebolt was slowing down horrified he looked around malfoy had thrown himself forward grabbed hold of the firebolts tail and was pulling it backyou harry was angry enough to hit malfoy but couldnt reach malfoy was panting with the effort of holding onto the firebolt but his eyes were sparkling maliciously he had achieved what hed wanted to do the snitch had disappeared againpenalty penalty to gryffindor ive never seen such tactics madam hooch screeched shooting up to where malfoy was sliding back onto his nimbus two thousand and oneyou cheating scum lee jordan was howling into the megaphonedancing out of professor mcgonagalls reach you filthy cheating b pprofessor mcgonagall didnt even bother to tell him off she was actually shaking her finger in malfoys direction her hat had fallenoff and she too was shouting furiouslyalicia took gryffindors penalty but she was so angry she missed by several feet the gryffindor team was losing concentration and the slytherins delighted by malfoys foul on harry were being spurred on to greater heightsslytherin in possession slytherin heading for goal montague scores lee groaned seventy twenty to gryffindorharry was now marking malfoy so closely their knees kept hitting each other harry wasnt going to let malfoy anywhere near the snitchget out of it potter malfoy yelled in frustration as he tried to turn and found harry blocking himangelina johnson gets the quaffle for gryffindor come on angelinacome onharry looked around every single slytherin player apart from malfoy was streaking up the pitch toward angelina including the slytherin keeper they were all going to block her harry wheeled the firebolt around bent so low he was lying flat along the handle and kicked it forward like a bullet he shot toward the slytherinsaaaaaaarrrghthey scattered as the firebolt zoomed toward them angelinas way was clearshe scores she scores gryffindor leads by eighty points to twentyharry who had almost pelted headlong into the stands skidded to a halt in midair reversed and zoomed back into the middle of the fieldand then he saw something to make his heart stand still malfoy was diving a look of triumph on his face there a few feet above the grass below was a tiny golden glimmer harry urged the firebolt downward but malfoy was miles ahead go go go harry urged his broom he was gaining on malfay harry flattened himself to the broom handle as bole sent a bludger at him he was at malfoys ankles he was level harry threw himself forward took both hands off his broom he knocked malfoys arm out of the way and yeshe pulled out of his dive his hand in the air and the stadium exploded harry soared above the crowd an odd ringing in his ears the tiny golden ball was held tight in his fist beating its wings hopelessly against his fingersthen wood was speeding toward him half blinded by tears he seized harry around the neck and sobbed unrestrainedly into his shoulder harry felt two large thumps as fred and george hit them then angelinasalicias and katies voices weve won the cup weve won the cuptangled together in a many armed hug the gryffindor team sank yelling hoarsely back to earthwave upon wave of crimson supporters was pouring over the barriers onto the field hands were raining down on their backs harry had a confused impression of noise and bodies pressing in on him then he and the rest of the team were hoisted onto the shoulders of the crowd thrust into the light he saw hagrid plastered with crimson rosettes yeh beat em harry yeh beat emwait till i tell buckbeak there was percy jumping up and down like a maniac all dignity forgotten professor mcgonagall was sobbing harder even than wood wiping her eyes with an enormous gryffindor flag and there fighting their way toward harry were ron and hermione words failed them they simply beamed as harry was borne toward the standswhere dumbledore stood waiting with the enormous quidditch cupif only there had been a dementor around as a sobbing wood passed harry the cup as he lifted it into the air harry felt he could haveproduced the worlds best patronuschapter sixteen professor trelawneys predictionharrys euphoria at finally winning the quidditch cup lasted at least a week even the weather seemed to be celebrating as june approached the days became cloudless and sultry and all anybody felt like doing was strolling onto the grounds and flopping down on the grass with several pints of iced pumpkin juice perhaps playing a casual game of gobstones or watching the giant squid propel itself dreamily across the surface of the lakebut they couldnt exams were nearly upon them and instead of lazing around outside the students were forced to remain inside the castletrying to bully their brains into concentrating while enticing wafts of summer air drifted in through the windows even fred and george weasley had been spotted working they were about to take their owls ordinary wizarding levels percy was getting ready to take his newts nastily exhausting wizarding tests the highest qualification hogwarts offered as percy hoped to enter the ministry of magic he needed top grades he was becoming increasingly edgy and gave very severe punishments to anybody who disturbed the quiet of the common room in the evenings in fact the only person who seemed more anxious than percy was hermioneharry and ron had given up asking her how she was managing to attend several classes at once but they couldnt restrain themselves when they saw the exam schedule she had drawn up for herself the first column readmonday oclock arithmancy oclock transfiguration lunchoclock charms oclock ancient runes hermione ron said cautiously because she was liable to explode when interrupted these days er are you sure youve copied down these times rightwhat snapped hermione picking up the exam schedule and examining ityes of course i haveis there any point asking how youre going to sit for two exams at once said harryno said hermione shortly have either of you seen my copy of numerology and gramaticaoh yeah i borrowed it for a bit of bedtime reading said ron but very quietly hermione started shifting heaps of parchment harry ronand hermione plenty of opportunity to speak to hagridbeakys gettin a bit depressed hagrid told them bending low on the pretense of checking that harrys flobberworm was still alive bin cooped up too long but still well know day after tomorrow one way or the other they had potions that afternoon which was an unqualified disaster try as harry might he couldnt get his confusing concoction to thicken and snape standing watch with an air of vindictive pleasure scribbled something that looked suspiciously like a zero onto his notes before moving awaythen came astronomy at midnight up on the tallest tower history of magic on wednesday morning in which harry scribbled everything florean fortescue had ever told him about medieval witch hunts while wishing he could have had one of fortescues choco nut sundaes with him in the stifling classroom wednesday afternoon meant herbology in the greenhouses under a baking hot sun then back to the common room once more with sunburnt necks thinking longingly of this time next daywhen it would all be overtheir second to last exam on thursday morning was defense against the dark arts professor lupin had compiled the most unusual exam any of them had ever taken a sort of obstacle course outside in the sun where they had to wade across a deep paddling pool containing a grindylowcross a series of potholes full of red caps squish their way across a patch of marsh while ignoring misleading directions from a hinkypunkthen climb into an old trunk and battle with a new boggartexcellent harry lupin muttered as harry climbed out of the trunkgrinning full marksflushed with his success harry hung around to watch ron and hermioneron did very well until he reached the hinkypunk which successfully confused him into sinking waist high into the quagmire hermione did everything perfectly until she reached the trunk with the boggart in itafter about a minute inside it she burst out again screaminghermione said lupin startled whats the matterp p professor mcgonagall hermione gasped pointing into the trunk sh she said id failed everythingit took a little while to calm hermione down when at last she had regained a grip on herself she harry and ron went back to the castleron was still slightly inclined to laugh at hermiones boggart but an argument was averted by the sight that met them on the top of the stepscornelius fudge sweating slightly in his pinstriped cloak was standing there staring out at the grounds he started at the sight of harryhello there harry he said just had an exam i expect nearly finishedyes said harry hermione and ron not being on speaking terms with the minister of magic hovered awkwardly in the backgroundlovely day said fudge casting an eye over the lakepity pityhe sighed deeply and looked down at harryim here on an unpleasant mission harry the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures required a witness to the execution of a mad hippogriff as i needed to visit hogwarts to check on the black situation i was asked to step indoes that mean the appeals already happened ron interruptedstepping forwardno no its scheduled for this afternoon said fudge looking curiously at ronthen you might not have to witness an execution at a said eon stoutly the hippogriff might get offbefore fudge could answer two wizards came through the castle doors behind him one was so ancient he appeared to be withering before their very eyes the other was tall and strapping with a thin back mustacheharry gathered that they were representatives of the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures because tie very old wizard squinted toward hagrids cabin and said in a feeble voice dear dear im getting too old for this two oclock isnt it fudgethe black mustached man was fingering something in his belt harry looked and saw that he was running one broad thumb along the blade of a shining axe ron opened his mouth to say something but hermione nudged him hard in the ribs and jerked her head toward the entrance hallwhyd you stop me said ron angrily as they entered the great hall for lunch did you see them theyve even got the axe ready this isnt justiceron your dad works for the ministry you cant go saying things like that to his boss said hermione but she too looked very upset as long as hagrid keeps his head this time and argue hi case properlythey cant possibly execute buckbeakbut harry could tell hermione didnt really believe what she was sayingall around them people were talking excitedly as they ate their lunchhappily anticipating the end of the exams that afternoon but harryron and hermione lost in worry about hagrid and buckbeak didnt join inharrys and rons last exam was divination hermiones muggle studiesthey walked up the marble staircase together hermione left them on the first floor and harry and ron proceeded all the way up to the seventhwhere many of their class were sitting on the spiral staircase to professor trelawneys classroom trying to cram in a bit of last minute studyingshes seeing us all separately neville informed them as they went to sit down next to him he had his copy of unfogging the future open on his lap at the pages devoted to crystal gazing have either of you ever seen anything in a crystal ball he asked them unhappilynope said ron in an offhand voice he kept checking his watch harryknew that he was counting down the time until buckbeaks appeal startedthe line of people outside the classroom shortened very slowly as each person climbed back down the silver ladder the rest of the class hissed what did she ask was it okaybut they all refused to sayshe says the crystal balls told her that if i tell you ill have a horrible accident squeaked neville as he clambered back down the ladder toward harry and ron who had now reached the landingthats convenient snorted ron you know im starting to think hermione was right about her he jabbed his thumb toward the trapdoor overhead shes a right old fraudyeah said harry looking at his own watch it was now two oclockwish shed hurry upparvati came back down the ladder glowing with prideshe says ive got all the makings of a true seer she informed harryand ron i saw loads of stuff well good luckshe hurried off down the spiral staircase toward lavenderronald weasley said the familiar misty voice from over their headsron grimaced at harry and climbed the silver ladder out of sight harry was now the only person left to be tested he settled himself on the floor with his back against the wall listening to a fly buzzing in the sunny window his mind across the grounds with hagridfinally after about twenty minutes rons large feet reappeared on the ladderhowd it go harry asked him standing uprubbish said ron couldnt see a thing so i made some stuff updont think she was convinced thoughmeet you in the common room harry muttered as professor trelawneys voice called harry potterthe tower room was hotter than ever before the curtains were closedthe fire was alight and the usual sickly scent made harry cough as he stumbled through the clutter of chairs and table to where professor trelawney sat waiting for him before a large crystal ballgood day my dear she said softly if you would kindly gaze into the orb take your time now then tell me what you see within itharry bent over the crystal ball and stared stared as hard as he couldwilling it to show him something other than swirling white fog but nothing happenedwell professor trelawney prompted delicately what do you seethe heat was overpowering and his nostrils were stinging with the perfumed smoke wafting from the fire beside them he thought of what ron had just said and decided to pretender said harry a dark shape umwhat does it resemble whispered professor trelawney think nowharry cast his mind around and it landed on buckbeaka hippogriff he said firmlyindeed whispered professor trelawney scribbling keenly on the parchment perched upon her knees my boy you may well be seeing the outcome of poor hagrids trouble with the ministry of magic look closer does the hippogriff appear to have its headyes said harry firmlyare you sure professor trelawney urged him are you quite suredear you dont see it writhing on the ground perhaps and a shadowy figure raising an axe behind itno said harry starting to feel slightly sickno blood no weeping hagridno said harry again wanting more than ever to leave the room and the heat it looks fine its flying awayprofessor trelawney sighedwell dear i think well leave it there a little disappointingbut im sure you did your bestrelieved harry got up picked up his bag and turned to go but then a loud harsh voice spoke behind himit will happen tonightharry wheeled around professor trelawney had gone rigid in her armchair her eyes were unfocused and her mouth saggings sorry said harrybut professor trelawney didnt seem to hear him her eyes started to roll harry sat there in a panic she looked as though she was about to have some sort of seizure he hesitated thinking of running to the hospital wing and then professor trelawney spoke again in the same harsh voice quite unlike her ownthe dark lord lies alone and friendless abandoned by his followershis servant has been chained these twelve years tonightbefore midnight the servant will break free and set out to rejoin his master the dark lord will rise again with his servants aid greater and more terrible than ever he was tonight before midnight the servant will set ou to rejoin his masterprofessor trelawneys head fell forward onto her chest she made a grunting sort of noise harry sat there staring at her then quite suddenly professor trelawneys head snapped up againim so sorry dear boy she said dreamily the heat of the day you know i drifted off for a momentharry sat there staring at heris there anything wrong my dearyou you just told me that the the dark lords going to rise again that his servants going to go back to himprofessor trelawney looked thoroughly startledthe dark lord he who must not be named my dear boy thats hardly something to joke about rise again indeed but you just said it you said the dark lord i think you must have dozed off too dear said professor trelawneyi would certainly not presume to predict anything quite as far fetched as thatharry climbed back down the ladder and the spiral staircasewondering had he just heard professor trelawney make a real prediction or had that been her idea of an impressive end to the testfive minutes later he was dashing past the security trolls outside the entrance to gryffindor tower professor trelawneys words still resounding in his head people were striding past him in the opposite direction laughing and joking heading for the grounds and a bit of long awaited freedom by the time he had reached the portrait hole and entered the common room it was almost deserted over in the cornerhowever sat ron and hermioneprofessor trelawney harry panted just told me but he stopped abruptly at the sight of their facesbuckbeak lost said ron weakly hagrids just sent thishagrids note was dry this time no tears had splattered it yet his hand seemed to have shaken so much as he wrote that it was hardly legiblelost appeal theyre going to execute at sunset nothing you can dodont come down i dont want you to see ithagrid weve got to go said harry at once he cant just sit there on his own waiting for the executionersunset though said ron who was staring out the window ill a glazed sort of way wed never be allowed specially you harryharry sank his head into his hands thinkingif we only had the invisibility cloakwhere is it said hermioneharry told her about leaving it in the passageway under the one eyed witchif snape sees me anywhere near there again im in serious trouble he finishedthats true said hermione getting to her feet if he sees youhow do you open the witchs hump againyou you tap it and say dissendium said harry but hermione didnt wait for the rest of his sentence she strode across the room pushed open the fat ladys portrait and vanished from sightshe hasnt gone to get it ron said staring after hershe had hermione returned a quarter of an hour later with the silvery cloak folded carefully under her robeshermione i dont know whats gotten into you lately said ronastounded first you hit malfoy then you walk out on professor trelawney hermione looked rather flatteredthey went down to dinner with everybody else but did not return to gryffindor tower afterward harry had the cloak hidden down tie front of his robes he had to keep his arms folded to hide the lump they skulked in an empty chamber off the entrance hall listening until they were sure it was deserted they heard a last pair of people hurrying across the hall and a door slamming hermione poked her head around the doorokay she whispered no one there cloak on walking very close together so that nobody would see them they crossed the hall on tiptoe beneath the cloak then walked down the stone front steps into the grounds the sun was already sinking behind the forbidden forest gilding the top branches of the treesthey reached hagrids cabin and knocked he was a minute in answeringand when he did he looked all around for his visitor pale faced and tremblingits us harry hissed were wearing the invisibility cloak let us in and we can take it offyeh shouldnve come hagrid whispered but he stood back and they stepped inside hagrid shut the door quickly and harry pulled off the cloakhagrid was not crying nor did he throw himself upon their necks he looked like a man who did not know where he was or what to do this helplessness was worse to watch than tearswan some tea he said his great hands were shaking as he reached for the kettlewheres buckbeak hagrid said hermione hesitantlyi i took him outside said hagrid spilling milk all over the table as he filled up the jug hes tethered in me pumpkin patch thought he oughta see the trees an an smell fresh air before hagrids hand trembled so violently that the milk jug slipped from his grasp and shattered all over the floorill do it hagrid said hermione quickly hurrying over and starting to clean up the messtheres another one in the cupboard hagrid said sitting down and wiping his forehead on his sleeve harry glanced at ron who looked back hopelesslyisnt there anything anyone can do hagrid harry asked fiercelysitting down next to him dumbledore hes tried said hagrid hes got no power ter overrule the committee he told em

dumbledore catch yeh out without permission harry yehll be in big troublesilent tears were now streaming down hermiones face but she hid them from hagrid bustling around making tea then as she picked up the milk bottle to pour some into the jug she let out a shriekron i dont believe it its scabbersron gaped at herwhat are you talking abouthermione carried the milk jug over to the table and turned it upside down with a frantic squeak and much scrambling to get back insidescabbers the rat came sliding out onto the tablescabbers said ron blankly scabbers what are you doing herehe grabbed the struggling rat and held him up to the light scabberslooked dreadful he was thinner than ever large tufts of hair had fallen out leaving wide bald patches and he writhed in rons hands as though desperate to free himself its okay scabbers said ron no cats theres nothing here to hurt youhagrid suddenly stood up his eyes fixed on the window his normally ruddy face had gone the color of parchmenttheyre cominharry ron and hermione whipped around a group of men was walking down the distant castle steps in front was albus dumbledore his silver beard gleaming in the dying sun next to him trotted cornelius fudgebehind them came the feeble old committee member and the executionermacnairyeh gotta go said hagrid every inch of him was trembling they mustn find yeh here go nowron stuffed scabbers into his pocket and hermione picked up the cloakill let yeh out the back way said hagridthey followed him to the door into his back garden harry felt strangely unreal and even more so when he saw buckbeak a few yards away tethered to a tree behind hagrids pumpkin patch buckbeak seemed to know something was happening he turned his sharp head from side to side and pawed the ground nervouslyits okay beaky said hagrid softly its okay he turned to harry ron and hermione go on he said get goinbut they didnt movehagrid we cant well tell them what really happened they cant kill him go said hagrid fiercely its bad enough without you lot in trouble an allthey had no choice as hermione threw the cloak over harry and ron they heard voices at the front of the cabin hagrid looked at the place where they had just vanished from sightgo quick he said hoarsely don listenand he strode back into his cabin as someone knocked at the front doorslowly in a kind of horrified trance harry ron and hermione set off silently around hagrids house as they reached the other side the front door closed with a sharp snapplease lets hurry hermione whispered i cant stand it i cant bear itthey started up the sloping lawn toward the castle the sun was sinking fast now the sky had turned to a clear purple tinged grey but to the west there was a ruby red glowron stopped deadoh please ron hermione beganits scabbers he wont stay put ron was bent over trying to keep scabbers in his pocket but the rat was going berserk squeaking madly twisting and flailing trying to sink his teeth into rons handscabbers its me you idiot its ron ron hissedthey heard a door open behind them and mens voicesoh ron please lets move theyre going to do it hermione breathedokay scabbers stay put they walked forward harry like hermione was trying not to listen to the rumble of voices behind them ron stopped againi cant hold him scabbers shut up everyonell hear us the rat was squealing wildly but not loudly enough to cover up the sounds drifting from hagrids garden there was a jumble of indistinct male voices a silence and then without warning the unmistakable swish and thud of an axehermione swayed on the spotthey did it she whispered to harry i d dont believe it they did itchapter seventeen cat rat and dogharrys mind had gone blank with shock the three of them stood transfixed with horror under the invisibility cloak the very last rays of the setting sun were casting a bloody light over the long shadowed grounds then behind them they heard a wild howlinghagrid harry muttered without thinking about what he was doing he made to turn back but both ron and hermione seized his armswe cant said ron who was paper white hell be in worse trouble if they know weve been to see himhermiones breathing was shallow and unevenhow could they she choked how could theycome on said ron whose teeth seemed to be chatteringthey set off back toward the castle walking slowly to keep themselves hidden under the cloak the light was fading fast nowby the time they reached open ground darkness was settling like a spell around themscabbers keep still ron hissed clamping his hand over his chestthe rat was wriggling madly ron came to a sudden halt trying to force scabbers deeper into his pocket whats the matter with you you stupid rat stay still ouch he bit meron be quiet hermione whispered urgently fudgell be out here in a minute he wont stay put scabbers was plainly terrified he was writhing with all his mighttrying to break free of rons gripwhats the matter with himbut harry had just seen stinking toward them his body low to the ground wide yellow eyes glinting eerily in the darkness crookshankswhether he could see them or was following the sound of scabberss squeaks harry couldnt tellcrookshanks hermione moaned no go away crookshanks go awaybut the cat was getting nearer scabbers notoo late the rat had slipped between rons clutching fingers hit the ground and scampered away in one bound crookshanks sprang after himand before harry or hermione could stop him ron had thrown the invisibility cloak off himself and pelted away into the darknessron hermione moanedshe and harry looked at each other then followed at a sprint it as impossible to run full out under the cloak they pulled it off and it streamed behind them like a banner as they hurtled after ron they could hear his feet thundering along ahead and his shouts at crookshanksget away from him get away scabbers come here there was a loud thudgotcha get off you stinking cat harry and hermione almost fell over ron they skidded to a stop right in front of him he was sprawled on the ground but scabbers was back in his pocket he had both hands held tight over the quivering lumpron come on back under the cloak hermione panted dumbledore the minister theyll be coming back out in a minute but before they could cover themselves again before they could even catch their breath they heard the soft pounding of gigantic pawssomething was bounding toward them quiet as a shadow an enormouspale eyed jet black dogharry reached for his wand but too late the dog had made an enormous leap and the front paws hit him on the chest he keeled over backward in a whirl of hair he felt its hot breath saw inch long teeth but the force of its leap had carried it too far it rolled off himdazed feeling as though his ribs were broken harry tried to stand up he could hear it growling as it skidded around for a new attackron was on his feet as the dog sprang back toward them he pushed harry aside the dogs jaws fastened instead around rons outstretched armharry lunged forward he seized a handful of the brutes hair but it was dragging ron away as easily as though he were a rag doll then out of nowhere something hit harry so hard across the face he was knocked off his feet again he heard hermione shriek with pain and fall tooharry groped for his wand blinking blood out of his eyes lumoshe whisperedthe wandlight showed him the trunk of a thick tree they had chased scabbers into the shadow of the whomping willow and its branches were creaking as though in a high wind whipping backward and forward to stop them going nearerand there at the base of the trunk was the dog dragging ron backward into a large gap in the roots ron was fighting furiously but his head and torso were slipping out of sight ron harry shouted trying to follow but a heavy branch whipped lethally through the air and he was forced backward againall they could see now was one of rons legs which he had hooked around a root in an effort to stop the dog from pulling him farther underground but a horrible crack cut the air like a gunshot rons leg had broken and a moment later his foot vanished from sightharry weve got to go for help hermione gasped she was bleeding too the willow had cut her across the shoulderno that things big enough to eat him we havent got time harry were never going to get through without help another branch whipped down at them twigs clenched like knucklesif that dog can get in we can harry panted darting here and theretrying to find a way through the vicious swishing branches but he couldnt get an inch nearer to the tree roots without being in range of the trees blowsoh help help hermione whispered frantically dancing u certainly on the spot pleasecrookshanks darted forward he slithered between the battering branches like a snake and placed his front paws upon a knot on the trunkabruptly as though the tree had been turned to marble it stopped moving not a leaf twitched or shookcrookshanks hermione whispered uncertainly she now grasped harrys arm painfully hard how did he know hes friends with that dog said harry grimly ive seen them together come on and keep your wand out they covered the distance to the trunk in seconds but before they had reached the gap in the roots crookshanks had slid into it with a flick of his bottlebrush tail harry went next he crawled forward headfirstand slid down an earthy slope to the bottom of a very low tunnelcrookshanks was a little way along his eyes flashing in the light from harrys wand seconds later hermione slithered down beside himwheres ron she whispered in a terrified voicethis way said harry setting off bent backed after crookshankswhere does this tunnel come out hermione asked breathlessly from behind himi dont know its marked on the marauders map but fred and george said no ones ever gotten into it it goes off the edge of the mapbut it looked like it was heading for hogsmeadethey moved as fast as they could bent almost double ahead of themcrookshankss tail bobbed in and out of view on and on went the passage it felt at least as long as the one to honeydukes all harry could think of was ron and what the enormous dog might be doing to him he was drawing breath in sharp painful gasps running at a crouchand then the tunnel began to rise moments later it twisted and crookshanks had gone instead harry could see a patch of dim light through a small openinghe and hermione paused gasping for breath edging forward both raised their wands to see what lay beyondit was a room a very disordered dusty room paper was peeling from the walls there were stains all over the floor every piece of furniturewas broken as though somebody had smashed it the windows were all boarded upharry glanced at hermione who looked very frightened but noddedharry pulled himself out of the hole staring around the room was deserted but a door to their right stood open leading to a shadowy hallway hermione suddenly grabbed harrys arm again her wide eyes were traveling around the boarded windowsharry she whispered i think were in the shrieking shackharry looked around his eyes fell on a wooden chair near them large chunks had been torn out of it one of the legs had been ripped off entirelyghosts didnt do that he said slowlyat that moment there was a creak overhead something had moved upstairs both of them looked up at the ceiling hermiones grip on harrys arm was so tight he was losing feeling in his fingers he raised his eyebrows at her she nodded again and let goquietly as they could they crept out into the hall and up the crumbling staircase everything was covered in a thick layer of dust except the floor where a wide shiny stripe had been made by something being dragged upstairsthey reached the dark landingnox they whispered together and the lights at the end of their wands went out only one door was open as they crept toward it they heard movement from behind it a low moan and then a deep loud purring they exchanged a last look a last nodwand held tightly before him harry kicked the door wide openon a magnificent four poster bed with dusty hangings lay crookshankspurring loudly at the sight of them on the floor beside him clutching his leg which stuck out at a strange angle was ronharry and hermione dashed across to himron are you okaywheres the dognot a dog ron moaned his teeth were gritted with pain harry its a trap what hes the dog hes an animagusron was staring over harrys shoulder harry wheeled around with a snap the man in the shadows closed the door behind thema mass of filthy matted hair hung to his elbows if eyes hadnt been shining out of the deep dark sockets he might have been a corpse the waxy skin was stretched so tightly over the bones of his face it looked like a skull his yellow teeth were bared in a grin it was sirius blackexpelliarmushe croaked pointing rons wand at themharrys and hermiones wands shot out of their hands high in the airand black caught them then he took a step closer his eyes were fixed on harryi thought youd come and help your friend he said hoarselyhis voice sounded as though he had long since lost the habit of using it your father would have done the same for me brave of you not to run for a teacher im grateful it will make everything much easierthe taunt about his father rang in harrys ears as though black had bellowed it a boiling hate erupted in harrys chest leaving no place for fear for the first time in his life he wanted his wand back in his hand not to defend himself but to attack to kill without knowingwhat he was doing he started forward but there was a sudden movement on either side of him and two pairs of hands grabbed him and held him back no harry hermione gasped in a petrified whisper ronhowever spoke to blackif you want to kill harry youll have to kill us too he said fiercely though the effort of standing upright was draining him of still more color and he swayed slightly as he spokesomething flickered in blacks shadowed eyeslie down he said quietly to ron you will damage that leg even moredid you hear me ron said weakly though he was clinging painfully to harry to stay upright youll have to kill all three of ustherell be only one murder here tonight said brack and his grin widenedwhys that harry spat trying to wrench himself free of ron and hermione didnt care last time did you didnt mind slaughtering all those muggles to get at pettigrew whats the matter gone soft in azkabanharry hermione whimpered be quiethe killed my mum and dad harry roared and with a huge effort he broke free of hermiones and rons restraint and lunged forward he had forgotten about magic he had forgotten that he was short and skinny and thirteen whereas black was a tall full grown man all harry knew was that he wanted to hurt black as badly as he could and that he didnt care how much he got hurt in return perhaps it was the shock of harry doing something so stupid but black didnt raise the wands in time one of harrys hands fastened over his wasted wrist forcing the wand tips away the knuckles of harrys other hand collided with the side of blacks head and they fell backwardinto the wall hermione was screaming ron was yelling there was a blinding flash as the wands in blacks hand sent a jet of sparks into the air that missed harrys face by inches harry felt the shrunken arm under his fingers twisting madly but he clung on his other hand punching every part of black it could findbut blacks free hand had found harrys throat no he hissed ive waited too long the fingers tightened harry choked his glasses askewthen he saw hermiones foot swing out of nowhere black let go of harry with a grunt of pain ron had thrown himself on blacks wand hand and harry heard a faint clatter he fought free of the tangle of bodies and saw his own wand rolling across the floor he threw himself toward it but arghcrookshanks had joined the fray both sets of front claws had sunk themselves deep into harrys arm harry threw him off but crookshanks now darted toward harrys wand no you dont roared harry and he aimed a kick at crookshanks that made the cat leap aside spitting harry snatched up his wand and turned get out of the way he shouted at ron and hermionethey didnt need telling twice hermione gasping for breath her lip bleeding scrambled aside snatching up her and rons wands ron crawled to the four poster and collapsed onto it panting his white face now tinged with green both hands clutching his broken legblack was sprawled at the bottom of the wall his thin chest rose and fell rapidly as he watched harry walking slowly nearer his wand pointing straight at blacks heartgoing to kill me harry he whisperedharry stopped right above him his wand still pointing at blacks chestlooking down at him a livid bruise was rising around blacks left eye and his nose was bleedingyou killed my parents said harry his voice shaking slightly but his wand hand quite steadyblack stared up at him out of those sunken eyesi dont deny it he said very quietly but if you knew the whole storythe whole story harry repeated a furious pounding in his ears you sold them to voldemort thats all i need to knowyouve got to listen to me black said and there was a note of urgency in his voice now youll regret it if you dont you dont understandi understand a lot better than you think said harry and his voice shook more than ever you never heard her did you my mum trying to stop voldemort killing me and you did that you did itbefore either of them could say another word something ginger streaked past harry crookshanks leapt onto blacks chest and settled himself there right over blacks heart black blinked and looked down at the catget off he murmured trying to push crookshanks off himbut crookshanks sank his claws into blacks robes and wouldnt shift he turned his ugly squashed face to harry and looked up at him with those great yellow eyes to his right hermione gave a dry sobharry stared down at black and crookshanks his grip tightening on the wand so what if he had to kill the cat too it was in league with black if it was prepared to die trying to protect black thatwasnt harrys business if black wanted to save it that only proved he cared more for crookshanks than for harrys parentsharry raised the wand now was the moment to do it now was the moment to avenge his mother and father he was going to kill black he had to kill black this was his chancethe seconds lengthened and still harry stood frozen there wand poisedblack staring up at him crookshanks on his chest rons ragged breathing came from near the bed hermione was quite silentand then came a new sound muffled footsteps were echoing up through the floor someone was moving downstairswere up here hermione screamed suddenly were up here sirius black quickblack made a startled movement that almost dislodged crookshanks harry gripped his wand convulsively do it now said a voice in his head but the footsteps were thundering up the stairs and harry still hadnt done itthe door of the room burst open in a shower of red sparks and harry wheeled around as professor lupin came hurtling into the room his face bloodless his wand raised and ready his eyes flickered over ron lying on the floor over hermione cowering next to the door to harrystanding there with his wand covering black and then to black himselfcrumpled and bleeding at harrys feetexpelliarmus lupin shoutedharrys wand flew once more out of his hand so did the two hermione was holding lupin caught them all deftly then moved into the room staring at black who still had crookshanks lying protectively across his chestharry stood there feeling suddenly empty he hadnt done it his nerve had failed him black was going to be handed back to the dementorsthen lupin spoke in a very tense voicewhere is he siriusharry looked quickly at lupin he didnt understannd what lupin meantwho was lupin talking about he turned to look at black againblacks face was quite expressionless for a few seconds he didnt move at all then very slowly he raised his empty hand and pointed straight at ron mystified harry glanced around at ron who looked bewilderedbut then lupin muttered staring at black so intently it seemed he was trying to read his mind why hasnt he shown himself before now unless lupins eyes suddenly widened as though he was seeing something beyond black something none of the rest could see unless he was the one unless you switched without telling mevery slowly his sunken gaze never leaving lupins face black noddedprofessor harry interrupted loudly whats going on but he never finished the question because what he saw made his voice die in his throat lupin was lowering his wand gazing fixed at blackthe professor walked to blacks side seized his hand pulled him to his feet so that crookshanks fell to the floor and embraced black like a brotherharry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomachdont believe it hermione screamedlupin let go of black and turned to her she had raised herself off the floor and was pointing at lupin wild eyed you you hermione you and himhermione calm down i didnt tell anyone hermione shrieked ive been covering up for you hermione listen to me please lupin shouted i can explain harry could feel himself shaking not with fear but with a fresh wave of furyi trusted you he shouted at lupin his voice wavering out of control and all the time youve been his friendyoure wrong said lupin i havent been siriuss friend but i am now let me explainno hermione screamed harry dont trust him hes been helping black get into the castle he wants you dead too hes a werewolfthere was a ringing silence everyones eyes were now on lupin who looked remarkably calm though rather palenot at all up to your usual standard hermione he said only one out of three im afraid i have not been helping sirius get into the castle and i certainly dont want harry dead an odd shiver passed over his face but i wont deny that i am a werewolfron made a valiant effort to get up again but fell back with a whimper of pain lupin made toward him looking concerned but ron gasped get away ftom me werewolflupin stopped dead then with an obvious effort he turned to hermione and said how long have you knownages hermione whispered since i did professor snapes essayhell be delighted said lupin coolly he assigned that essay hoping someone would realize what my symptoms meant did you check the lunar chart and realize that i was always ill at the full moon or did you realize that the boggart changed into the moon when it saw meboth hermione said quietlylupin forced a laughyoure the cleverest witch of your age ive ever met hermioneim not hermione whispered if id been a bit cleverer id have told everyone what you arebut they already know said lupin at least the staff dodumbledore hired you when he knew you were a werewolf ron gasped is he madsome of the staff thought so said lupin he had to work very hard to convince certain teachers that im trustworthy and he was wrong harry yelled youve been helping him all the timehe was pointing at black who suddenly crossed to the four poster bed and sank onto it his face hidden in one shaking hand crookshanks leapt up beside him and stepped onto his lap purring ron edged away from both of them dragging his legi have not been helping sirius said lupin if youll give me a chance ill explain look he separated harrys rons and hermiones wands and threw each back to its owner harry caught his stunnedthere said lupin sticking his own wand back into his belt youre armed were not now will you listenharry didnt know what to think was it a trickif you havent been helping him he said with a furious glance at black how did you know he was herethe map said lupin the marauders map i was in my office examining it you know how to work it harry said suspiciouslyof course i know how to work it said lupin waving his hand impatiently i helped write it im moony that was my friends nickname for me at schoolyou wrote the important thing is i was watching it carefully this eveningbecause i had an idea that you ron and hermione might try and sneak out of the castle to visit hagrid before his hippogriff was executedand i was right wasnt ihe had started to pace up and down looking at them little patches of dust rose at his feetyou might have been wearing your fathers old cloak harry how dyou know about the cloakthe number of times i saw james disappearing under it said lupinwaving an impatient hand again the point is even if youre wearing an invisibility cloak you still show up on the marauders map i watched you cross the grounds and enter hagrids hut twenty minutes later you left hagrid and set off back toward the castle but you were now accompanied by somebody elsewhat said harry no we werenti couldnt believe my eyes said lupin still pacing and ignoring harrys interruption i thought the map must be malfunctioning how could he be with you no one was with us said harryand then i saw another dot moving fast toward you labeled sirius black i saw him collide with you i watched as he pulled two of you into the whomping willow one of us ron said angrilyno ron said lupin two of youhe had stopped his pacing his eyes moving over rondo you think i could have a look at the rat he said evenlywhat said ron whats scabbers got to do with iteverything said lupin could i see him pleaseron hesitated then put a hand inside his robes scabbers emergedthrashing desperately ron had to seize his long bald tail to stop him escaping crookshanks stood up on blacks leg and made a soft hissing noiselupin moved closer to ron he seemed to be holding his breath as he gazed intently at scabberswhat ron said again holding scabbers close to him looking scaredwhats my rat got to do with anythingthats not a rat croaked sirius black suddenlywhat dyou mean of course hes a rat no hes not said lupin quietly hes a wizardan animagus said black by the name of peter pettigrewchapter eighteen moony wormtail paddfoot and prongsit took a few seconds for the absurdity of this statement to sink inthen ron voiced what harry was thinkingyoure both mentalridiculous said hermione faintlypeter pettigrews dead said harry he killed him twelve years agohe pointed at black whose face twitched convulsivelyi meant to he growled his yellow teeth bared but little peter got the better of me not this time thoughand crookshanks was thrown to the floor as black lunged at scabbers ron yelled with pain as blacks weight fell on his broken legsirius no lupin yelled launching himself forwards and dragging black away from ron again wait you cant do it just like that they need to understand weve got to explain we can explain afterwards snarled black trying to throw lupin offone hand was still clawing the air as it tried to reach scabbers who was squealing like a piglet scratching rons face and neck as he tried to escapetheyve got a right to know everything lupin panted still trying to restrain black rons kept him as a pet there are parts of it even i dont understand and harry you owe harry the truth siriusblack stopped struggling though his hollowed eyes were still fixed on scabbers who was clamped tightly under rons bitten scratched ad bleeding handsall right then black said without taking his eyes off the rattell them whatever you like but make it quick remus i want to commit the murder i was imprisoned foryoure nutters both of you said ron shakily looking round at harry and hermione for support ive had enough of this im offhe tried to heave himself up on his good leg but lupin raised his wand again pointing it at scabbersyoure going to hear me out ron he said quietly just keep a tight hold on peter while you listenhes not peter hes scabbers ron yelled trying to fore the rat back into his front pocket but scabbers was fighting to hard ron swayed and overbalanced and harry caught him am pushed him back down to the bedthen ignoring black harry turned to lupinthere were witnesses who saw pettigrew die he said a whole street full of themthey didnt see what they thought they saw said black savagely still watching scabbers struggling in rons handseveryone thought sirius killed peter said lupin nodding i believed it myself until i saw the map tonight because the marauders map never lies peters alive rons holding him harryharry looked down at ron and as their eyes met they agreed silentlyblack and lupin were both out of their minds their story made no sense whatsoever how could scabbers be peter pettigrew azkaban must have unhinged black after all but why was lupin playing along with himthen hermione spoke in a trembling would be calm sort of voice as though trying to will professor lupin to talk sensiblybut professor lupin scabbers cant be pettigrew it just cant be true you know it cantwhy cant it be true lupin said calmly as though they were in classand hermione had simply spotted a problem in an experiment with grindylowsbecause because people would know if peter pettigrew had been an animagus we did animagi in class with professor mcgonagall and i looked them up when i did my homework the ministry of magic keeps tabs on witches and wizards who can become animals theres a register showing what animal they become and their markings and things and i went and looked professor mcgonagall up on the register and there have been only seven animagi this century and pettigrews name wasnt on the listharry had barely had time to marvel inwardly at the effort hermione put into her homework when lupin started to laughlight again hermione he said but the ministry never knew that here used to be three unregistered animagi running around hogwartsi youre going to tell them the story get a move on remus said black who was still watching scabberss every desperate move ive waited twelve years im not going to wait much longerall right but youll need to help me sirius said lupin i only know how it beganlupin broke off there had been a loud creak behind him the bedroom door had opened of its own accord all five of them stared at it then lupin strode toward it and looked out into the landingno one therethis place is haunted said ronits not said lupin still looking at the door in a puzzled way the shrieking shack was never haunted the screams and howls the villagers used to hear were made by mehe pushed his graying hair out of his eyes thought for a moment then said thats where all of this starts with my becoming a werewolfnone of this could have happened if i hadnt been bitter and if i hadnt been so foolhardyhe looked sober and tired ron started to interrupt but hermione saidshh she was watching lupin very intentlyi as a very small boy when i received the bite my parents tried everything but in those days there was no cure the potion that professor snape has been making for me is a very recent discovery it makes me safe you see as long as i take it in the week preceding the full moon i keep my mind when i transform im able to curl up in my office a harmless wolf and wait for the moon to wane againbefore the wolfsbane potion was discovered however i became a fully fledged monster once a month it seemed impossible that i would be able to come to hogwarts other parents werent likely to want their children exposed to mebut then dumbledore became headmaster and he was sympathetic he said that as long as we took certain precautions there was no reason i shouldnt come to school lupin sighed and looked directly at harry i told you months ago that the whomping willow was planted the year i came to hogwarts the truth is that it was planted because i came to hogwarts this house lupin looked miserably around the room the tunnel that leads to it they were built for my use once a month i was smuggled out of the castle into this place to transformthe tree was placed at the tunnel mouth to stop anyone coming across me while i was dangerousharry couldnt see where this story was going but he was listening raptly all the same the only sound apart from lupins voice was scabberss frightened squeakingmy transformations in those days were were terrible it is very painful to turn into a werewolf i was separated from humans to bite so i bit and scratched myself instead the villagers heard the noise and the screaming and thought they were hearing particularly violent spirits dumbledore encouraged the rumor even now when the house has been silent for years the villagers dont dare approach itbut apart from my transformations i was happier than i had ever been in my life for the first time ever i had friends three great friendssirius black peter pettigrew and of course your father harry james potternow my three friends could hardly fail to notice that i disappeared once a month i made up all sorts of stories i told them my mother was ill and that i had to go home to see her i was terrified they would desert me the moment they found out what i was but of course theylike you hermione worked out the truthand they didnt desert me at all instead they did something for me that would make my transformations not only bearable but the best timesof my life they became animagimy dad too said harry astoundedyes indeed said lupin it took them the best part of three years to work out how to do it your father and sirius here were the cleverest students in the school and lucky they were because the animagus transformation can go horribly wrong one reason the ministry keeps a close watch on those attempting to do it peter needed all the help he could get from james and sirius finally in our fifth year they managed it they could each turn into a different animal at willbut how did that help you said hermione sounding puzzledthey couldnt keep me company as humans so they kept me company as animals said lupin a werewolf is only a danger to people they sneaked out of the castle every month under jamess invisibility cloakthey transformed peter as the smallest could slip beneath the willows attacking branches and touch the knot that freezes it they would then slip down the tunnel and join me under their influence i became less dangerous my body was still wolfish but my mind seemed to become less so while i was with themhurry up remus snarled black who was still watching scabbers with a horrible sort of hunger on his faceim getting there sirius im getting there well highly exciting possibilities were open to us now that we could all transform soon we were leaving the shrieking shack and roaming the school grounds and the village by night sirius and james transformed into such large animalsthey were able to keep a werewolf in check i doubt whether any hogwarts students ever found out more about the hogwarts grounds and hogsmeade than we did and thats how we came to write the marauders map and sign it with our nicknames sirius is padfoot peter is wormtail james was prongswhat sort of animal harry began but hermione cut him offthat was still really dangerous running around in the dark with a werewolf what if youd given the others the slip and bitten somebodya thought that still haunts me said lupin heavily and there were near misses many of them we laughed about them afterwards we were young thoughtless carried away with our own clevernessi sometimes felt guilty about betraying dumbledores trust of coursehe had admitted me to hogwarts when no other headmaster would have done so and he had no idea i was breaking the rules he had set down for my own and others safety he never knew i had led three fellow students into becoming animagi illegally but i always managed to forget my guilty feelings every time we sat down to plan our next months adventure and i havent changedlupins face had hardened and there was self disgust in his voice all this year i have been battling with myself wondering whether i should tell dumbledore that sirius was an animagus but i didnt do it whybecause i was too cowardly it would have meant admitting that id betrayed his trust while i was at school admitting that id led others along with me and dumbledores trust has meant everything to me he let me into hogwarts as a boy and he gave me a job when i have been shunned all my adult life unable to find paid work because of what i am and so i convinced myself that sirius was getting into the school using dark arts he learned from voldemort that being an animagus had nothing to do with it so in a way snapes been right about me all alongsnape said black harshly taking his eyes off scabbers for the first time in minutes and looking up at lupin whats snape got to do with ithes here sirius said lupin heavily hes teaching here as wellhe looked up at harry ron and hermioneprofessor snape was at school with us he fought very hard against my appointment to the defense against the dark arts job he has been telling dumbledore a year that i am not to be trusted he has his reasons you see sirius here played a trick on him which nearly killed him a trick which involved me black made a derisive noiseit served him right he sneered sneaking around trying to find out what we were up to hoping he could get us expelledseverus was very interested in where i went every month lupin told harry ron and hermione we were in the same year you know and we er didnt like each other very much he especially disliked jamesjealous i think of jamess talent on the quidditch field anyway snape had seen me crossing the grounds with madam pomfrey one evening as she led me toward the whomping willow to transform sirius thought it would be er amusing to tell snape all he had to do was prod the knot on the tree trunk with a long stick and hed be able to get in after me well of course snape tried it if hed got as far as this house hed have met a fully grown werewolf but your father whod heard what sirius had done went after snape and pulled him back at great risk to his life snape glimpsed me though at the end of the tunnel he was forbidden by dumbledore to tell anybody but from that time on he knew what i wasso thats why snape doesnt like you said harry slowly because he thought you were in on the jokethats right sneered a cold voice from the wall behind lupinseverus snape was pulling off the invisibility cloak his wand pointingdirectly at lupinchapter nineteen the servant of lord voldemorthermione screamed black leapt to his feet harry felt as though hed received a huge electric shocki found this at the base of the whomping willow said snape throwing the cloak aside careful to keep this wand pointing directly at lupins chest very useful potter i thank yousnape was slightly breathless but his face was full of suppressed triumph youre wondering perhaps how i knew you were here he saidhis eyes glittering ive just been to your office lupin you forgot to take your potion tonight so i took a gobletful along and very lucky i did lucky for me i mean lying on your desk was a certain map one glance at it told me all i needed to know i saw you running along this passageway and out of sightseverus lupin began but snape overrode himive told the headmaster again and again that youre helping your old friend black into the castle lupin and heres the proof not even i dreamed you would have the nerve to use this old place as your hideout severus youre making a mistake said lupin urgently you havent heard everything i can explain sirius is not here to kill harry two more for azkaban tonight said snape his eyes now gleaming fanatically i shall be interested to see how dumbledore takes thishe was quite convinced you were harmless you know lupin a tame werewolf you fool said lupin softly is a schoolboy grudge worth putting an innocent man back inside azkabanbang thin snakelike cords burst from the end of snapes wand and twisted themselves around lupins mouth wrists and ankles he overbalanced and fell to the floor unable to move with a roar of rageblack started toward snape but snape pointed his wand straight between blacks eyesgive me a reason he whispered give me a reason to do it and i swear i willblack stopped dead it would have been impossible to say which face showed more hatredharry stood there paralyzed not knowing what to do or whom to believehe glanced around at ron and hermione ron looked just as confused as he did still fighting to keep hold on the struggling scabbers hermionehowever took an uncertain step toward snape and said in a very breathless voice professor snape it it wouldnt hurt to hear what theyve got to say w would itmiss granger you are already facing suspension from this schoolsnape spat you potter and weasley are out of bounds in the company of a convicted murderer and a werewolf for once in your life hold your tonguebut if if there was a mistake keep quiet you stupid girl snape shouted looking suddenly quite deranged dont talk about what you dont understand a few sparks shot out of the end of his wand which was still pointed at blacks face hermione fell silentvengeance is very sweet snape breathed at black how i hoped i would be the one to catch youthe jokes on you again severus black snarled as long as this boy brings his rat up to the castle he jerked his head at ron ill come quietlyup to the castle said snape silkily i dont think we need to go that far all i have to do is call the dementors once we get out of the willow theyll be very pleased to see you black pleased enough to give you a little kiss i daresay i what little color there was in blacks face left ityou youve got to hear me out he croaked the rat look at the rat but there was a mad glint in snapes eyes that harry had never seen before he seemed beyond reasoncome on all of you he said he clicked his fingers and the ends of the cords that bound lupin flew to his hands ill drag the werewolfperhaps the dementors will have a kiss for him too before he knew what he was doing harry had crossed the room in three strides and blocked the doorget out of the way potter youre in enough trouble already snarled snape if i hadnt been here to save your skin professor lupin could have killed me about a hundred times this yearharry said ive been alone with him loads of times having defense lessons against the dementors if he was helping black why didnt he just finish me off thendont ask me to fathom the way a werewolfs mind works hissed snapeget out of the way potteryoure pathetic harry yelled just because they made a fool of you at school you wont even listen silence i will not be spoken to like that snape shriekedlooking madder than ever like father like son potter i have just saved your neck you should be thanking me on bended knee you would have been well served if hed killed you youd have died like your father too arrogant to believe you might be mistaken in black now get out of the way or i will make you get out of the way potterharry made up his mind in a split second before snape could take even one step toward him he had raised his wandexpelliarmus he yelled except that his wasnt the only voice that shouted there was a blast that made the door rattle on its hinges snape was lifted off his feet and slammed into the wall then slid down it to the floor a trickle of blood oozing from under his hair he had been knocked outharry looked around both ron and hermione had tried to disarm snape at exactly the same moment snapes wand soared in a high arc and landed on the bed next to crookshanksyou shouldnt have done that said black looking at harryyou should have left him to meharry avoided blacks eyes he wasnt sure even now that hed done the right thingwe attacked a teacher we attacked a teacher hermione whimperedstaring at the lifeless snape with frightened eyes oh were going to be in so much trouble lupin was struggling against his bonds black bent down quickly and untied him lupin straightened up rubbing his arms where the ropes had cut into themthank you harry he saidim still not saying i believe you he told lupinthen its time we offered you some proof said lupin you boy give me peter please nowron clutched scabbers closer to his chestcome off it he said weakly are you trying to say he broke out of azkaban just to get his hands on scabbers i mean he looked up at harry and hermione for support okay say pettigrew could turn into a rat there are millions of rats hows he supposed to know which one hes after if he was locked up in azkabanyou know sirius thats a fair question said lupin turning to black and frowning slightly how did you find out where he wasblack put one of his clawlike hands inside his robes and took out a crumpled piece of paper which he smoothed flat and held out to show the othersit was the photograph of ron and his family that had appeared in the daily prophet the previous summer and there on rons shoulder was scabbershow did you get this lupin asked black thunderstruckfudge said black when he came to inspect azkaban last year he gave me his paper and there was peter on the front page on this boys shoulder i knew him at once how many times had i seen him transform and the caption said the boy would be going back to hogwarts to where harry wasmy god said lupin softly staring from scabbers to the picture in the paper and back again his front pawwhat about it said ron defiantlyhes got a toe missing said blackof course lupin breathed so simple so brilliant he cut it off himselfjust before he transformed said black when i cornered him he yelled for the whole street to hear that id betrayed lily and jamesthen before i could curse him he blew apart the street with the wand behind his back killed everyone within twenty feet of himself and sped down into the sewer with the other ratsdidnt you ever hear ron said lupin the biggest bit of peter they found was his fingerlook scabbers probably had a fight with another rat or something hes been in my family for ages right twelve years in fact said lupin didnt you ever wonder why he was living so longwe weve been taking good care of him said ronnot looking too good at the moment though is he said lupin id guess hes been losing weight ever since he heard sirius was on the loose againhes been scared of that mad cat said ron nodding toward crookshanks who was still purring on the bedbut that wasnt right harry thought suddenly scabbers had been looking ill before he met crookshanks ever since rons return from egypt since the time when black had escapedthis cat isnt mad said black hoarsely he reached out a bony hand and stroked crookshankss fluffy head hes the most intelligent of his kind ive ever met he recognized peter for what he was right away and when he met me he knew i was no dog it was a while before he trusted me finally i managed to communicate to him what i was after and hes been helping me what do you mean breathed hermionehe tried to bring peter to me but couldnt so he stole the passwords into gryffindor tower for me as i understand it he took them from a boys bedside tableharrys brain seemed to be sagging under the weight of what he was hearing it was absurd and yetbut peter got wind of what was going on and ran for it croaked blackthis cat crookshanks did you call him told me peter had left blood on the sheets i supposed he bit himself well faking his own death had worked oncethese words jolted harry to his sensesand why did he fake his death he said furiously because he knew you were about to kill him like you killed my parentsno said lupin harry and now youve come to finish him offyes i have said black with an evil look at scabbersthen i shouldve let snape take you harry shoutedharry said lupin hurriedly dont you see all this time wevethought sirius betrayed your parents and peter tracked him down but it was the other way around dont you see peter betrayed your mother and father sirius tracked peter down thats not true harry yelled he was their secret keeper he said so before you turned up he said he killed themhe was pointing at black who shook his head slowly the sunken eyes were suddenly over brightharry i as good as killed them he croaked i persuaded lily and james to change to peter at the last moment persuaded them to use him as secret keeper instead of me im to blame i know it the night they died id arranged to check on peter make sure he was still safebut when i arrived at his hiding place hed gone yet there was no sign of a struggle it didnt feel right i was scared i set out for your parents house straight away and when i saw their house destroyed and their bodies i realized what peter mustve done what id donehis voice broke he turned awayenough of this said lupin and there was a steely note in his voice harry had never heard before theres one certain way to prove what really happened ron give me that ratwhat are you going to do with him if i give him to you ron asked lupin tenselyforce him to show himself said lupin if he really is a rat it wont hurt himron hesitated then at long last he held out scabbers and lupin took him scabbers began to squeak without stopping twisting and turninghis tiny black eyes bulging in his head ready sirius said lupinblack had already retrieved snapes wand from the bed he approached lupin and the struggling rat and his wet eyes suddenly seemed to be burning in his facetogether he said quietlyi think so said lupin holding scabbers tightly in one hand and his wand in the other on the count of three one two threea flash of blue white light erupted from both wands for a momentscabbers was frozen in midair his small gray form twisting madly ron yelled the rat fell and hit the floor there was another blinding flash of light and then it was like watching a speeded up film of a growing tree a head was shooting upward from the ground limbs were sprouting a moment later a man was standing where scabbers had been cringing and wringing his hands crookshanks was spitting and snarling on the bed the hair on his back was standing uphe was a very short man hardly taller than harry and hermione his thin colorless hair was unkempt and there was a large bald patch on top he had the shrunken appearance of a plump man who has lost a lot of weight in a short time his skin looked grubby almost like scabberss fur and something of the rat lingered around his pointed nose and his very small watery eyes he looked around at them all his breathing fast and shallow harry saw his eyes dart to the door and back againwell hello peter said lupin pleasantly as though rats frequently erupted into old school friends around him long time no sees sirius r remus even pettigrews voice was squeakyagain his eyes darted toward the door my friends my old friendsblacks wand arm rose but lupin seized him around the wrist gave him a warning took then turned again to pettigrew his voice light and casualweve been having a little chat peter about what happened the night lily and james died you might have missed the finer points while you were squeaking around down there on the bed remus gasped pettigrew and harry could see beads of sweat breakingout over his pasty face you dont believe him do you he tried to kill me remusso weve heard said lupin more coldly id like to clear up one or two little matters with you peter if youll be so hes come to try and kill me again pettigrew squeaked suddenlypointing at black and harry saw that he used his middle finger because his index was missing he killed lily and james and now hes going to kill me too youve got to help me remusblacks face looked more skull like than ever as he stared at pettigrew with his fathomless eyesno ones going to try and kill you until weve sorted a few things out said lupinsorted things out squealed pettigrew looking wildly about him once more eyes taking in the boarded windows and again the only door i knew hed come after me i knew hed be back for me ive been waiting for this for twelve yearsyou knew sirius was going to break out of azkaban said lupin his brow furrowed when nobody has ever done it beforehes got dark powers the rest of us can only dream of pettigrew shouted shrilly how else did he get out of there i suppose he who must not be named taught him a few tricksblack started to laugh a horrible mirthless laugh that filled the whole roomvoldemort teach me tricks he saidpettigrew flinched as though black had brandished a whip at himwhat scared to hear your old masters name said black i dont blame you peter his lot arent very happy with you are theydont know what you mean sirius muttered pettigrew his breathingfaster than ever his whole face was shining with sweat nowyou havent been hiding from me for twelve years said black youve been hiding from voldemorts old supporters i heard things in azkabanpeter they all think youre dead or youd have to answer to themive heard them screaming all sorts of things in their sleep sounds like they think the double crosser double crossed them voldemort went to the potters on your information and voldemort met his downfall there and not all voldemorts supporters ended up in azkaban did theythere are still plenty out here biding their time pretending theyve seen the error of their waysif they ever got wind that you were still alive peter dont know what youre talking about said pettigrew again more shrilly than ever he wiped his face on his sleeve and looked up at lupin you dont believe this this madness remus i must admit peter i have difficulty in understanding why an innocent man would want to spend twelve years as a rat said lupin evenlyinnocent but scared squealed pettigrew if voldemorts supporters were after me it was because i put one of their best men in azkaban the spy sirius blackblacks face contortedhow dare you he growled sounding suddenly like the bearsized dog he had been i a spy for voldemort when did i ever sneak around people who were stronger and more powerful than myself but you peter ill never understand why i didnt see you were the spy from the start you always liked big friends whod look after you didnt you it used to be us me and remus and jamespettigrew wiped his face again he was almost panting for breathme a spy must be out of your mind never dont know how you can say such a lily and james only made you secret keeper because i suggested itblack hissed so venomously that pettigrew took a step backward i thought it was the perfect plan a bluff voldemort would be sure to come after me would never dream theyd use a weak talentless thing like you it must have been the finest moment of your miserable lifetelling voldemort you could hand him the potterspettigrew was muttering distractedly harry caught words like far fetched and lunacy but he couldnt help paying more attention to the ashen color of pettigrews face and the way his eyes continued to dart toward the windows and doorprofessor lupin said hermione timidly can can i say somethingcertainly hermione said lupin courteouslywell scabbers i mean this this man hes been sleeping in harrys dormitory for three years if hes working for you know who how come he never tried to hurt harry before nowthere said pettigrew shrilly pointing at ron with his maimed handthank you you see remus i have never hurt a hair of harrys headwhy should iill tell you why said black because you never did anything for anyone unless you could see what was in it for you voldemorts been in hiding for fifteen years they say hes half dead you werent about to commit murder right under albus dumbledores nose for a wreck of a wizard whod lost all of his power were you youd want to be quite sure he was the biggest bully in the playground before you went back to him wouldnt you why else did you find a wizard family to take you inkeeping an ear out for news werent you peter just in case your old protector regained strength and it was safe to rejoin himpettigrew opened his mouth and closed it several times he seemed to have lost the ability to talker mr black sirius said hermioneblack jumped at being addressed like this and stared at hermione as though he had never seen anything quite like herif you dont mind me asking how how did you get out of azkaban if you didnt use dark magicthank you gasped pettigrew nodding frantically at her exactlyprecisely what i but lupin silenced him with a look black was frowning slightly at hermione but not as though he were annoyed with her he seemed to be pondering his answeri dont know how i did it he said slowly i think the only reason i never lost my mind is that i knew i was innocent that wasnt a happy thought so the dementors couldnt suck it out of me but it kept me sane and knowing who i am helped me keep my powers so when it all became too much i could transform in my cell become a dogdementors cant see you know he swallowed they feel their way toward people by feeding off their emotions they could tell that my feelings were less less human less complex when i was a dog but they thought of course that i was losing my mind like everyone else in there so it didnt trouble them but i was weak very weak and i had no hope of driving them away from me without a wandbut then i saw peter in that picture i realized he was at hogwarts with harry perfectly positioned to act if one hint reached his ears that the dark side was gathering strength againpettigrew was shaking his head mouthing noiselessly but staring all the while at black as though hypnotizedready to strike at the moment he could be sure of allies and to deliver the last potter to them if he gave them harry whod dare say hed betrayed lord voldemort hed be welcomed back with honorsso you see i had to do something i was the only one who knew peter was still aliveharry remembered what mr weasley had told mrs wealsey the guards say hes been talking in his sleep always the same words hes at hogwartsÃ¢â‚¬Å“it was as if someone had lit a fire in my head and the dementors couldnt destroy it it wasnt a happy feeling it was an obsession but it gave me strength it cleared my mind so one night when they opened my door to bring food i slipped past them as a dogits so much harder for them to sense animal emotions that they were confused i was thin very thin thin enough to slip through the bars i swam as a dog back to the mainland i journeyed north and slipped into the hogwarts grounds as a dog ive been living in the forest ever since except when i came to watch the quidditch of courseyou fly as well as your father did harryhe looked at harry who did not look awaybelieve me croaked black believe me harry i never betrayed james and lily i would have died before i betrayed themand at long last harry believed him throat too tight to speak he noddednopettigrew had fallen to his knees as though harrys nod had been his own death sentence he shuffled forward on his knees groveling his hands clasped in front of him as though prayingsirius its me its peter your friend you wouldnt black kicked out and pettigrew recoiledtheres enough filth on my robes without you touching them said blackremus pettigrew squeaked turning to lupin instead writhing imploringly in front of him you dont believe this wouldnt sirius have told you theyd changed the plannot if he thought i was the spy peter said lupin i assume thats why you didnt tell me sirius he said casually over pettigrews headforgive me remus said blacknot at all padfoot old friend said lupin who was now rolling up his sleeves and will you in turn forgive me for believing you were the spyof course said black and the ghost of a grin flitted across his gaunt face he too began rolling up his sleeves shall we kill him togetheryes i think so said lupin grimlyyou wouldnt you wont gasped pettigrew and he scrambled around to ronron havent i been a good friend a good pet you wont let them kill me ron will you youre on my side arent youbut ron was staring at pettigrew with the utmost revulsioni let you sleep in my bed he saidkind boy kind master pettigrew crawled toward ron you wont let them do it i was your rat i was a good petif you made a better rat than a human its not much to boast aboutpeter said black harshly ron going still paler with pain wrenched his broken leg out of pettigrews reach pettigrew turned on his kneesstaggered forward and seized the hem of hermiones robessweet girl clever girl you you wont let them help mehermione pulled her robes out of pettigrews clutching hands and backed away against the wall looking horrifiedpettigrew knelt trembling uncontrollably and turned his head slowly toward harryharry harry you look just like your father just like himhow dare you speak to harry roared black how dare you face him how dare you talk about james in front of himharry whispered pettigrew shuffling toward him hands outstretchedharry james wouldnt have wanted me killed james would have understood harry he would have shown me mercyboth black and lupin strode forward seized pettigrews shoulders and threw him backward onto the floor he sat there twitching with terrorstaring up at themyou sold lily and james to voldemort said black who was shaking toodo you deny itpettigrew burst into tears it was horrible to watch like an oversizedbalding baby cowering on the floorsirius sirius what could i have done the dark lord you have no idea he has weapons you cant imagine i was scared sirius i was never brave like you and remus and james i never meant it to happenhe who must not be named forced me dont lie bellowed black youd been passing information to him for a year before lily and james died you were his spyhe he was taking over everywhere gasped pettigrew wh what was there to be gained by refusing himwhat was there to be gained by fighting the most evil wizard who has ever existed said black with a terrible fury in his face only innocent lives peteryou dont understand whined pettigrew he would have killed mesiriusthen you should have died roared black died rather than betray your friends as we would have done for youblack and lupin stood shoulder to shoulder wands raisedyou should have realized said lupin quietly if voldemort didnt kill you we would good bye peterhermione covered her face with her hands and turned to the wallno harry yelled he ran forward placing himself in front pettigrewfacing the wands you cant kill him he said breathlessly you cantblack and lupin both looked staggeredharry this piece of vermin is the reason you have no parents black snarled this cringing bit of filth would have seen you die toowithout turning a hair you heard him his own stinking skin meant more to him than your whole familyi know harry panted well take him up to the castle well hand him over to the dementors he can go to azkaban but dont kill himharry gasped pettigrew and he flung his arms around harrys kneesyou thank you its more than i deserve thank you get off me harry spat throwing pettigrews hands off him in disgustim not doing this for you im doing it because i dont reckon my dad wouldve wanted them to become killers just for youno one moved or made a sound except pettigrew whose breath was coming in wheezes as he clutched his chest black and lupin were looking at each other then with one movement they lowered their wandsyoure the only person who has the right to decide harry said blackbut think think what he didhe can go to azkaban harry repeated if anyone deserves that placehe doespettigrew was still wheezing behind himvery well said lupin stand aside harryharry hesitatedim going to tie him up said lupin thats all i swearharry stepped out of the way thin cords shot from lupins wand this time and next moment pettigrew was wriggling on the floor bound and gaggedbut if you transform peter growled black his own wand pointing at pettigrew too we will kill you you agree harryharry looked down at the pitiful figure on the floor and nodded so that pettigrew could see himright said lupin suddenly businesslike ron i cant mend bones nearly as well as madam pomfrey so i think its best if we just strap your leg up until we can get you to the hospital winghe hurried over to ron bent down tapped rons leg with his wand and muttered ferula bandages spun up rons leg strapping it tightly to a splint lupin helped him to his feet ron put his weight gingerly on the leg and didnt wincethats better he said thankswhat about professor snape said hermione in a small voice looking down at snapes prone figuretheres nothing seriously wrong with him said lupin bending over snape and checking his pulse you were just a little overenthusiastic still out cold er perhaps it will be best if we dont revive him until were safety back in the castle we can take him like thishe muttered mobilicorpus as though invisible strings were tied to snapes wrists neck and knees he was pulled into a standing positionhead still lolling unpleasantly like a grotesque puppet he hung a fewinches above the ground his limp feet dangling lupin picked up the invisibility cloak and tucked it safely into his pocketand two of us should be chained to this said black nudging pettigrew with his toe just to make sureill do it said lupinand me said ron savagely limping forwardblack conjured heavy manacles from thin air soon pettigrew was upright again left arm chained to lupins right right arm to rons left rons face was set he seemed to have taken scabberss true identity as a personal insult crookshanks leapt lightly off the bed and led the way out of the room his bottlebrush tail held jauntily highchapter twenty the dementors kissharry had never been part of a stranger group crookshanks led the way down the stairs lupin pettigrew and ron went next looking like entrants in a six legged race next came professor snape drifting creepily along his toes hitting each stair as they descended held up by his own wand which was being pointed at him by sirius harry and hermione brought up the reargetting back into the tunnel was difficult lupin pettigrew and ron had to turn sideways to manage it lupin still had pettigrew covered with his wand harry could see them edging awkwardly along the tunnel in single file crookshanks was still in the lead harry went right after black who was still making snape drift along ahead of them he kept bumping his lolling head on the low ceiling harry had the impression black was making no effort to prevent thisyou know what this means black said abruptly to harry as they made their slow progress along the tunnel turning pettigrew inyou re free said harryyes said black but im also i dont know if anyone ever told you im your godfatheryeah i knew that said harrywell your parents appointed me your guardian said black stifflyif anything happened to themharry waited did black mean what he thought he meantill understand of course if you want to stay with your aunt and uncle said black but well think about it once my names cleared if you wanted a a different homesome sort of explosion took place in the pit of harrys stomachwhat live with you he said accidentally cracking his head on a bit of rock protruding from the ceiling leave the dursleysof course i thought you wouldnt want to said black quickly i understand i just thought id are you insane said harry his voice easily as croaky as blacksof course i want to leave the dursleys have you got a house when can i move inblack turned right around to look at him snapes head was scraping the ceiling but black didnt seem to careyou want to he said you mean ityeah i mean it said harryblacks gaunt face broke into the first true smile harry had seen upon it the difference it made was startling as though a person ten years younger were shining through the starved mask for a moment he was recognizable as the man who had laughed at harrys parents weddingthey did not speak again until they had reached the end of the tunnelcrookshanks darted up first he had evidently pressed his paw to the knot on the trunk because lupin pettigrew and ron clambered upward without any sound of savaging branchesblack saw snape up through the hole then stood back for harry and hermione to pass at last all of them were outthe grounds were very dark now the only light came from the distant windows of the castle without a word they set off pettigrew was still wheezing and occasionally whimpering harrys mind was buzzing he was going to leave the dursleys he was going to live with sirius black his parents best friend he felt dazed what would happen when he told the dursleys he was going to live with the convict theyd seen on television one wrong move peter said lupin threateningly ahead his wand was still pointed sideways at pettigrews chestsilently they tramped through the grounds the castle lights growing slowly larger snape was still drifting weirdly ahead of black his chin bumping on his chest and then a cloud shifted there were suddenly dim shadows on the ground their party was bathed in moonlightsnape collided with lupin pettigrew and ron who had stopped abruptlyblack froze he flung out one arm to make harry and hermione stopharry could see lupins silhouette he had gone rigid then his limbs began to shakeoh my hermione gasped he didnt take his potion tonight hes not saferun black whispered run nowbut harry couldnt run ron was chained to pettigrew and lupin he leapt forward but black caught him around the chest and threw him backleave it to me runthere was a terrible snarling noise lupins head was lengthening so was his body his shoulders were hunching hair was sprouting visibly on his face and hands which were curling into clawed paws crookshankss hair was on end again he was backing away as the werewolf reared snapping its long jaws sirius disappeared from harrys side he had transformed the enormous bearlike dog bounded forward as the werewolf wrenched itself free of the manacle binding itthe dog seized it about the neck and pulled it backward away from ron and pettigrew they were locked jaw to jaw claws ripping at each otherharry stood transfixed by the sight too intent upon the battle to notice anything else it was hermiones scream that alerted him pettigrew had dived for lupins dropped wand ron unsteady on his bandaged leg fell there was a bang a burst of light and ron lay motionless on the ground another bang crookshanks flew into the air and back to the earth in a heapexpelliarmus harry yelled pointing his own wand at pettigrew lupins wand flew high into the air and out of sight stay where you are harry shouted running forwardtoo late pettigrew had transformed harry saw his bald tail whip through the manacle on rons outstretched arm and heard a scurrying through the grassthere was a howl and a rumbling growl harry turned to see the werewolf taking flight it was galloping into the forest sirius hes gone pettigrew transformed harry yelledblack was bleeding there were gashes across his muzzle and back but at harrys words he scrambled up again and in an instant the sound of his paws faded to silence as he pounded away across the groundsharry and hermione dashed over to ronwhat did he do to him hermione whispered rons eyes were onlyhalf closed his mouth hung open he was definitely alive they could hear him breathing but he didnt seem to recognize themi dont knowharry looked desperately around black and lupin both gone they had no one but snape for company still hanging unconscious in midairwed better get them up to the castle and tell someone said harrypushing his hair out of his eyes trying to think straight come but then from beyond the range of their vision they heard a yelping a whining a dog in painsirius harry muttered staring into the darknesshe had a moments indecision but there was nothing they could do for ron at the moment and by the sound of it black was in trouble harry set off at a run hermione right behind him the yelping seemed to be coming from the ground near the edge of the lake they pelted toward it and harry running flat out felt the cold without realizing what it must mean the yelping stopped abruptly as they reached the lakeshore they saw why sirius had turned back into a man he was crouched on all fourshis hands over his headnooo he moaned nooo pleaseand then harry saw them dementors at least a hundred of them gliding in a black mass around the lake toward them he spun around the familiar icy cold penetrating his insides fog starting to obscure his vision more were appearing out of the darkness on every side they were encircling themherrnione think of something happy harry yelled raising his wandblinking furiously to try and clear his vision shaking his head to rid it of the faint screaming that had started inside it im going to live with my godfather im leaving the dursleyshe forced himself to think of black and only black and began to chantexpecto patronum expecto patronumblack gave a shudder rolled over and lay motionless on the groundpale as deathhell be all right im going to go and live with himexpecto patronum hermione help me expecto patronumexpecto hermione whispered expecto expecto but she couldnt do it the dementors were closing in barely ten feet from them they formed a solid wall around harry and hermione and were getting closerexpecto patronum harry yelled trying to blot the screaming from his ears expecto patronuma thin wisp of silver escaped his wand and hovered like mist before himat the same moment harry felt hermione collapse next to him he was alone completely aloneexpecto expecto patronum harry felt his knees hit the cold grass fog was clouding his eyes with a huge effort he fought to remember sirius was innocent innocent well be okay i mgoing to live with him ex ecto patronum he gaspedby the feeble light of his formless patronus he saw a dementor haltvery close to him it couldnt walk through the cloud of silver mist harry had conjured a dead slimy hand slid out from under the cloak it made a gesture as though to sweep the patronus asideno no harry gasped hes innocent expecto expecto patronum he could feet them watching him hear their rattling breath like an evil wind around him the nearest dementor seemed to be considering him then it raised both its rotting hands and lowered its hoodwhere there should have been eyes there was only thin gray scabbed skin stretched blankly over empty sockets but there was a mouth a gaping shapeless hole sucking the air with the sound of a death rattlea paralyzing terror filled harry so that he couldnt move or speak his patronus flickered and diedwhite fog was blinding him he had to fight expecto patronum he couldnt see and in the distance he heard the familiar screamingexpecto patronum he groped in the mist for sirius and found his arm they werent going to take himbut a pair of strong clammy hands suddenly attached themselves around harrys neck they were forcing his face upward he could feel its breath it was going to get rid of him first he could feel its putrid breath his mother was screaming in his ears she was going to be the last thing he ever heard and then through the fog that was drowning him he thought he saw a silvery light growing brighter and brighter he felt himself fall forward onto the grass facedown too weak to move sick and shakingharry opened his eyes the dementor must have released him the blinding light was illuminating the grass around him the screaming had stopped the cold was ebbing awaysomething was driving the dementors back it was circling around him and black and hermione they were leavingthe air was warm againwith every ounce of strength he could muster harry raised his head a few inches and saw an animal amid the light galloping away across the lake eyes blurred with sweat harry tried to make out what it was it was as bright as a unicorn fighting to stay consciousharry watched it canter to a halt as it reached the opposite shore for a moment harry saw by its brightness somebody welcoming it backraising his hand to pat it someone who looked strangely familiar but it couldnt beharry didnt understand he couldnt think anymore he felt the last of his strength leave him and his head hit the ground as he faintedchapter twenty one hermiones secretshocking business shocking miracle none of them died never heard the like by thunder it was lucky you were there snapethank you ministerorder of merlin second class id say first class if i can wangle itthank you very much indeed ministernasty cut youve got there blacks work i supposeas a matter of fact it was potter weasley and granger ministernoblack had bewitched them i saw it immediately a confundus charm to judge by their behavior they seemed to think there was a possibility he was innocent they werent responsible for their actions on the other hand their interference might have permitted black to escape they obviously thought they were going to catch black single handed theyve got away with a great deal before now im afraid its given them a rather high opinion of themselves and of course potter has always been allowed an extraordinary amount of license by the headmaster ah well snape harry potter you know weve all got a bit of a blind spot where hes concernedand yet is it good for him to be given so much special treatmentpersonally i try and treat him like any other student and any other student would be suspended at the very least for leading his friends into such danger consider minister against all school rules after all the precautions put in place for his protection out of bounds at night consorting with a werewolf and a murderer and i have reason to believe he has been visiting hogsmeade illegally too well well we shall see snape we shall see the boy has undoubtedly been foolishharry lay listening with his eyes tight shut he felt very groggy the words he was hearing seemed to be traveling very slowly from his ears to his brain so that it was difficult to understand his limbs felt like lead his eyelids too heavy to lift he wanted to lie here on this comfortable bed foreverwhat amazes me most is the behavior of the dementors youve really no idea what made them retreat snapeno minister by the time i had come round they were heading back to their positions at the entrancesextraordinary and yet black and harry and the girl all unconscious by the time i reached them i bound and gagged blacknaturally conjured stretchers and brought them all straight back to the castlethere was a pause harrys brain seemed to be moving a little fasterand as it did a gnawing sensation grew in the pit of his stomachhe opened his eyeseverything was slightly blurred somebody had removed his glasses he was lying in the dark hospital wing at the very end of the ward he could make out madam pomfrey with her back to him bending over a bedharry squinted rons red hair was visible beneath madam pomfreys armharry moved his head over on the pillow in the bed to his right lay hermione moonlight was falling across her bed her eyes were open tooshe looked petrified and when she saw that harry was awake pressed a finger to her lips then pointed to the hospital wing door it was ajarand the voices of cornelius fudge and snape were coming through it from the corridor outsidemadam pomfrey now came walking briskly up the dark ward to harrys bedhe turned to took at her she was carrying the largest block of chocolate he had ever seen in his life it looked like a small boulderah youre awake she said briskly she placed the chocolate on harrys bedside table and began breaking it apart with a small hammerhows ron said harry and hermione togetherhell live said madam pomfrey grimly as for you two youll be staying here until im satisfied youre potter what do you think youre doingharry was sitting up putting his glasses back on and picking up his wandi need to see the headmaster he saidpotter said madam pomfrey soothingly its all right theyve got black hes locked away upstairs the dementors will be performing the kiss any moment now whatharry jumped up out of bed hermione had done the same but his shout had been heard in the corridor outside next second cornelius fudge and snape had entered the wardharry harry whats this said fudge looking agitated you should be in bed has he had any chocolate he asked madam pomfrey anxiouslyminister listen harry said sirius blacks innocent peterpettigrew faked his own death we saw him tonight you cant let the dementors do that thing to sirius hes but fudge was shaking his head with a small smile on his faceharry harry youre very confused youve been through a dreadful ordeal lie back down now weve got everything under controlyou havent harry yelled youve got the wrong manminister listen please hermione said she had hurried to harrys side and was gazing imploringly into fudges face i saw him too it was rons rat hes an animagus pettigrew i mean and you see minister said snape confunded both of them blacks done a very good job on them were not confunded harry roaredminister professor said madam pomfrey angrily i must insist that you leave potter is my patient and he should not be distressedim not distressed im trying to tell them what happened harry said furiously if theyd just listen but madam pomfrey suddenly stuffed a large chunk of chocolate into harrys mouth he choked and she seized the opportunity to force him back onto the bednow please minister these children need care please leave the door opened again it was dumbledore harry swallowed his mouthful of chocolate with great difficulty and got up againprofessor dumbledore sirius black for heavens sake said madam pomfrey hysterically is this a hospital wing or not headmaster i must insist my apologies poppy but i need a word with mr potter and miss granger said dumbledore calmly i have just been talking to sirius black i suppose hes told you the same fairy tale hes planted in potters mind spat snape something about a rat and pettigrew being alive that indeed is blacks story said dumbledore surveying snape closely through his half moon spectaclesand does my evidence count for nothing snarled snape peter pettigrew was not in the shrieking shack nor did i see any sign of him on the groundsthat was because you were knocked out professor said hermione earnestly you didnt arrive in time to hear miss granger hold your tonguenow snape said fudge startled the young lady is disturbed in her mind we must make allowances i would like to speak to harry and hermione alone said dumbledore abruptly cornelius severus poppy please leave usheadmaster sputtered madam pomfrey they need treatment they need rest this cannot wait said dumbledore i must insistmadam pomfrey pursed her lips and strode away into her office at the end of the ward slamming the door behind her fudge consulted the large gold pocket watch dangling from his waistcoatthe dementors should have arrived by now he said ill go and meet them dumbledore ill see you upstairshe crossed to the door and held it open for snape but snape hadnt movedyou surely dont believe a word of blacks story snape whispered his eyes fixed on dumbledores facei wish to speak to harry and hermione alone dumbledore repeatedsnape took a step toward dumbledoresirius black showed he was capable of murder at the age of sixteen he breathed you havent forgotten that headmaster you havent forgotten that he once tried to kill memy memory is as good as it ever was severus said dumbledore quietlysnape turned on his heel and marched through the door fudge was still holding it closed behind them and dumbledore turned to harry and hermione they both burst into speech at the same timeprofessor blacks telling the truth we saw pettigrew he escaped when professor lupin turned into a werewolf hes a rat pettigrews front paw i mean finger he cut it off pettigrew attacked ron it wasnt sirius but dumbledore held up his hand to stem the flood of explanationsit is your turn to listen and i beg you will not interrupt me because there is very little time he said quietly there is not a shred of proof to support blacks story except your word and the word of two thirteen year old wizards will not convince anybody a street full of eyewitnesses swore they saw sirius murder pettigrew i myself gave evidence to the ministry that sirius had been the potters secret keeperprofessor lupin can tell you harry said unable to stop himself professor lupin is currently deep in the forest unable to tell anyone anything by the time he is human again it will be too late sirius will be worse than dead i might add that werewolves are so mistrusted by most of our kind that his support will count for very little and the fact that he and sirius are old friends but listen to me harry it is too late you understand me you must see that professor snapes version of events is far more convincing than yourshe hates sirius hermione said desperately all because of some stupid trick sirius played on him sirius has not acted like an innocent man the attack on the fat lady entering gryffindor tower with a knife without pettigrew alive or dead we have no chance of overturning siriuss sentencebut you believe usyes i do said dumbledore quietly but i have no power to make other men see the truth or to overrule the minister of magicharry stared up into the grave face and felt as though the ground beneath him were falling sharply away he had grown used to the idea that dumbledore could solve anything he had expected dumbledore to pull some amazing solution out of the air but no their last hope was gonewhat we need said dumbledore slowly and his light blue eyes moved from harry to hermione is more timebut hermione began and then her eyes became very round ohnow pay attention said dumbledore speaking very low and very clearly sirius is locked in professor flitwicks office on the seventh floor thirteenth window from the right of the west tower if all goes well you will be able to save more than one innocent life tonight but remember this both of you you must not be seen miss granger you know the law you know what is at stake you must not be seenharry didnt have a clue what was going on dumbledore had turned on his heel and looked back as he reached the doori am going to lock you in it is he consulted his watch five minutes to midnight miss granger three turns should do it good luckgood luck harry repeated as the door closed behind dumbledore three turns whats he talking about what are we supposed to dobut hermione was fumbling with the neck of her robes pulling from beneath them a very long very fine gold chainharry come here she said urgently quickharry moved toward her completely bewildered she was holding the chain out he saw a tiny sparkling hourglass hanging from ithere she had thrown the chain around his neck tooready she said breathlesslywhat are we doing harry said completely losthermione turned the hourglass over three timesthe dark ward dissolved harry had the sensation that he was flying very fast backward a blur of colors and shapes rushed past him his ears were pounding he tried to yell but couldnt hear his own voice and then he felt solid ground beneath his feet and everything came into focus again he was standing next to hermione in the deserted entrance hall and a stream of golden sunlight was falling across the paved floor from the open front doors he looked wildly around at hermione the chain of the hourglass cutting into his neckhermione what in here hermione seized harrys arm and dragged him across the hallto the door of a broom closet she opened it pushed him inside among the buckets and mops then slammed the door behind themwhat how hermione what happenedweve gone back in time hermione whispered lifting the chain off harrys neck in the darkness three hours backharry found his own leg and gave it a very hard pinch it hurt a lotwhich seemed to rule out the possibility that he was having a very bizarre dreambut shh listen someones coming i think i think it might be ushermione had her ear pressed against the cupboard doorfootsteps across the hall yes i think its us going down to hagridsare you telling me harry whispered that were here in this cupboard and were out there tooyes said hermione her ear still glued to the cupboard door im sure its us it doesnt sound like more than three people and were walking slowly because were under the invisibility cloak she broke off still listening intentlyweve gone down the front stepshermione sat down on an upturned bucket looking desperately anxiousbut harry wanted a few questions answeredwhere did you get that hourglass thingits called a time turner hermione whispered and i got it from professor mcgonagall on our first day back ive been using it all year to get to all my lessons professor mcgonagall made me swear i wouldnt tell anyone she had to write all sorts of letters to the ministry ofmagic so i could have one she had to tell them that i was a model student and that id never ever use it for anything except my studies ive been turning it back so i could do hours over againthats how ive been doing several lessons at once see butharry i dont understand what dumbledore wants us to do why did he tell us to go back three hours hows that going to help siriusharry stared at her shadowy facethere must be something that happened around now he wants us to change he said slowly what happened we were walking down to hagrids three hours agothis is three hours ago and we are walking down to hagrids said hermione we just heard ourselves leavingharry frowned he felt as though he were screwing up his whole brain in concentrationdumbledore just said just said we could save more than one innocent life and then it hit him hermione were going to save buckbeakbut how will that help siriusdumbledore said he just told us where the window is the window of flitwicks office where theyve got sirius locked up weve got to fly buckbeak up to the window and rescue sirius sirius can escape on buckbeak they can escape togetherfrom what harry could see of hermiones face she looked terrifiedif we manage that without being seen itll be a miraclewell weve got to try havent we said harry he stood up and pressed his ear against the door doesnt sound like anyones therecome on lets goharry pushed open the closet door the entrance hall was deserted as quietly and quickly as they could they darted out of the closet anddown the stone steps the shadows were already lengthening the tops of the trees in the forbidden forest gilded once more with goldif anyones looking out of the window hermione squeaked looking up at the castle behind themwell run for it said harry determinedly straight into the forestall right well have to hide behind a tree or something and keep a lookout okay but well go around by the greenhouses said hermione breathlessly we need to keep out of sight of hagrids front door or well see us we must be nearly at hagrids by nowstill working out what she meant harry set off at a sprint hermione behind him they tore across the vegetable gardens to the greenhousespaused for a moment behind them then set off again fast as they couldskirting around the whomping willow tearing toward the shelter of the forestsafe in the shadows of the trees harry turned around seconds laterhermione arrived beside him pantingright she gasped we need to sneak over to hagrids keep out of sight harrythey made their way silently through the trees keeping to the very edge of the forest then as they glimpsed the front of hagrids house they heard a knock upon his door they moved quickly behind a wide oak trunk and peered out from either side hagrid had appeared in his doorwayshaking and white looking around to see who had knocked and harry heard his own voiceits us were wearing the invisibility cloak let us in and we can take it offyeh shouldnve come hagrid whispered he stood back then shut the door quicklythis is the weirdest thing weve ever done harry said ferventlylets move along a bit hermione whispered we need to get nearer to buckbeakthey crept through the trees until they saw the nervous hippogrifftethered to the fence around hagrids pumpkin patchnow harry whisperedno said hermione if we steal him now those committee people will think hagrid set him free weve got to wait until theyve seen hes tied outsidethats going to give us about sixty seconds said harry this was starting to seem impossibleat that moment there was a crash of breaking china from inside hagrids cabinthats hagrid breaking the milk jug hermione whispered im going to find scabbers in a moment sure enough a few minutes later they heard hermiones shriek of surprisehermione said

change time nobody you heard dumbledore if were seen wed only be seen by ourselves and hagridharry what do you think youd do if you saw yourself bursting into hagrids house said hermioneid id think id

happened when wizards have meddled with time loads of them ended up killing their past or future selves by mistakeokay said harry it was just an idea i just thought but hermione nudged him and pointed toward the castle harry moved his head a few inches to get a clear view of the distant front doorsdumbledore fudge the old committee member and macnair the executioner were coming down the stepswere about to come out hermione breathedand sure enough moments later hagrids back door opened and harry saw himself ron and hermione walking out of it with hagrid it waswithout a doubt the strangest sensation of his life standing behind the tree and watching himself in the pumpkin patchits okay beaky its okay hagrid said to buckbeak then he turned to harry ron and hermione go on get goinhagrid we cant well tell them what really happened they cant kill him go its bad enough without you lot in trouble an allharry watched the hermione in the pumpkin patch throw the invisibility cloak over him and rongo quick don listenthere was a knock on hagrids front door the execution party had arrived hagrid turned around and headed back into his cabin leaving the back door ajar harry watched the grass flatten in patches all around the cabin and heard three pairs of feet retreating he ron and hermione had gone but the harry and hermione hidden in the treescould now hear what was happening inside the cabin through the back doorwhere is the beast came the cold voice of macnairout outside hagrid croakedharry pulled his head out of sight as macnairs face appeared at hagrids window staring out at buckbeak then they heard fudgewe er have to read you the official notice of execution hagridill make it quick and then you and macnair need to sign it macnairyoure supposed to listen too thats procedure macnairs face vanished from the window it was now or neverwait here harry whispered to hermione ill do itas fudges voice started again harry darted out from behind his treevaulted the fence into the pumpkin patch and approached buckbeakit is the decision of the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures that the hippogriff buckbeak hereafter called the condemnedshall he executed on the sixth of june at sundown careful not to blink harry stared up into buckbeaks fierce orange eyes once more and bowed buckbeak sank to his scaly knees and then stood up again harry began to fumble with the knot of rope tying buckbeak to the fencesentenced to execution by beheading to be carried out by the committees appointed executioner walden macnaicome on buckbeak harry murmured come on were going to help youquietly quietlyas witnessed below hagrid you sign hereharry threw all his weight onto the rope but buckbeak had dug in his front feetwell lets get this over with said the reedy voice of the committee member from inside hagrids cabin hagrid perhaps it will be better if you stay inside no i i wan ter be with him i don wan him ter be alone footsteps echoed from within the cabinbuckbeak move harry hissedharry tugged harder on the rope around buckbeaks neck the hippogriff began to walk rustling its wings irritably they were still ten feet away from the forest in plain view of hagrids back door one momentplease macnair came dumbledores voice you need to sign too the footsteps stopped harry heaved on the rope buckbeak snapped his beak and walked a little fasterhermiones white face was sticking out from behind a treeharry hurry she mouthedharry could still hear dumbledores voice talking from within the cabinhe gave the rope another wrench buckbeak broke into a grudging trotthey had reached the treesquick quick hermione moaned darting out from behind her treeseizing the rope too and adding her weight to make buckbeak move fasterharry looked over his shoulder they were now blocked from sight they couldnt see hagrids garden at allstop he whispered to hermione they might hear us hagrids back door had opened with a bang harry hermione and buckbeak stood quite still even the hippogriff seemed to be listening intentlysilence then where is it said the reedy voice of the committee member where is the beastit was tied here said the executioner furiously i saw it just herehow extraordinary said dumbledore there was a note of amusement in his voicebeaky said hagrid huskilythere was a swishing noise and the thud of an axe the executioner seemed to have swung it into the fence in anger and then came the howling and this time they could hear hagrids words through his sobsgone gone bless his little beak hes gone musta pulled himself free beaky yeh clever boybuckbeak started to strain against the rope trying to get back to hagrid harry and hermione tightened their grip and dug their heels into the forest floor to stop himsomeone untied him the executioner was snarling we should search the grounds the forestmacnair if buckbeak has indeed been stolen do you really think the thief will have led him away on foot said dumbledore still sounding amused search the skies if you will hagrid i could do with a cup of tea or a large brandyo o course professor said hagrid who sounded weak with happiness come in come inharry and hermione listened closely they heard footsteps the soft cursing of the executioner the snap of the door and then silence once morenow what whispered harry looking aroundwell have to hide in here said hermione who looked very shaken we need to wait until theyve gone back to the castle then we wait until its safe to fly buckbeak up to siriuss window he wont be there foranother couple of hours oh this is going to be difficultshe looked nervously over her shoulder into the depths of the forestthe sun was setting nowwere going to have to move said harry thinking hard weve got to be able to see the whomping willow or we wont know whats going onokay said hermione getting a firmer grip on buckbeaks rope but weve got to keep out of sight harry rememberthey moved around the edge of the forest darkness falling thickly around them until they were hidden behind a clump of trees through which they could make out the willowtheres ron said harry suddenlya dark figure was sprinting across the lawn and its shout echoed through the still night airget away from him get away scabbers come here and then they saw two more figures materialize out of nowhere harry watched himself and hermione chasing after ron then he saw ron divegotcha get off you stinking cat theres sirius said harry the great shape of the dog had bounded out from the roots of the willow they saw him bowl harry over then seize ronlooks even worse from here doesnt it said harry watching the dog pulling ron into the roots ouch look i just got walloped by the tree and so did you this is weird the whomping willow was creaking and lashing out with its lower branches they could see themselves darting here and there trying to reach the trunk and then the tree frozethat was crookshanks pressing the knot said hermioneand there we go harry muttered were inthe moment they disappeared the tree began to move again seconds later they heard footsteps quite close by dumbledore macnair fudgeand the old committee member were making their way up to the castleright after wed gone down into the passage said hermione if only dumbledore had come with usmacnair and fudge wouldve come too said harry bitterly i bet you anything fudge wouldve told macnair to murder sirius on the spotthey watched the four men climb the castle steps and disappear from view for a few minutes the scene was deserted then here comes lupin said harry as they saw another figure sprinting down the stone steps and hating toward the willow harry looked up at the sky clouds were obscuring the moon completelythey watched lupin seize a broken branch from the ground and prod the knot on the trunk the tree stopped fighting and lupin toodisappeared into the gap in its rootsif hed only grabbed the cloak said harry its just lying therehe turned to hermioneif i just dashed out now and grabbed it snaped never be able to get it and harry we mustnt be seenhow can you stand this he asked hermione fiercely just standing here and watching it happen he hesitated im going to grab the cloakharry nohermione seized the back of harrys robes not a moment too soon just then they heard a burst of song it was hagrid making his way up to the castle singing at the top of his voice and weaving slightly as he walked a large bottle was swinging from his handssee hermione whispered see what would have happened weve got to keep out of sight no buckbeakthe hippogriff was making frantic attempts to get to hagrid again harry seized his rope too straining to hold buckbeak back they watched hagrid meander tipsily up to the castle he was gone buckbeak stopped fighting to get away his head drooped sadlybarely two minutes later the castle doors flew open yet again and snape came charging out of them running toward the willowharrys fists clenched as they watched snape skid to a halt next to the tree looking around he grabbed the cloak and held it upget your filthy hands off it harry snarled under his breath shhsnape seized the branch lupin had used to freeze the tree prodded the knot and vanished from view as he put on the cloakso thats it said hermione quietly were all down there and now weve just got to wait until we come back up againshe took the end of buckbeaks rope and tied it securely around the nearest tree then sat down on the dry ground arms around her kneesharry theres something i dont understand why didnt the dementors get sirius i remember them coming and then i think i passed out there were so many of themharry sat down too he explained what hed seen how as the nearest dementor had lowered its mouth to harrys a large silver something had come galloping across the lake and forced the dementors to retreathermiones mouth was slightly open by the time harry had finishedbut what was ittheres only one thing it could have been to make the dementors gosaid harry a real patronus a powerful onebut who conjured itharry didnt say anything he was thinking back to the person hed seen on the other bank of the lake he knew who he thought it had been but how could it have beendidnt you see what they looked like said hermione eagerly was it one of the teachersno said harry he wasnt a teacherbut it must have been a really powerful wizard to drive all those dementors away if the patronus was shining so brightly didnt it light him up couldnt you see yeah i saw him said harry slowly but maybe i imagined it i wasnt thinking straight i passed out right afterwardwho did you think it wasi think harry swallowed knowing how strange this was going to sound i think it was my dadharry glanced up at hermione and saw that her mouth was fully open nowshe was gazing at him with a mixture of alarm and pityharry your dads well dead she said quietlyi know that said harry quicklyyou think you saw his ghosti dont know no he looked solidbut then maybe i was seeing things said harry but from what i could see it looked like him ive got photos of himhermione was still looking at him as though worried about his sanityi know it sounds crazy said harry flatly he turned to took at buckbeak who was digging his beak into the ground apparently searching for worms but he wasnt really watching buckbeakhe was thinking about his father and about his fathers three oldest friends moony wormtail padfoot and prongs had all four of them been out on the grounds tonight wormtail had reappeared this evening when everyone had thought he was dead was it so impossible his father had done the same had he been seeing things across the take the figure had been too far away to see distinctly yet he had felt surefor a moment before hed lost consciousnessthe leaves overhead rustled faintly in the breeze the moon drifted in and out of sight behind the shifting clouds hermione sat with her face turned toward the willow waitingand then at last after over an hourhere we come hermione whisperedshe and harry got to their feet buckbeak raised his head they saw lupin ron and pettigrew clambering awkwardly out of the hole in the roots then came hermione then the unconscious snape drifting weirdly upward next came harry and black they all began to walk toward the castleharrys heart was starting to beat very fast he glanced up at the skyany moment now that cloud was going to move aside and show the moonharry hermione muttered as though she knew exactly what he was thinking weve got to stay put we mustnt be seen theres nothing we can doso were just going to let pettigrew escape all over again said harryquietlyhow do you expect to find a rat in the dark snapped hermionetheres nothing we can do we came back to help sirius were not supposed to be doing anything elseall rightthe moon slid out from behind its cloud they saw the tiny figures across the grounds stop then they saw movement there goes lupin hermione whispered hes transforming hermione said harry suddenly weve got to movewe mustnt i keep telling you not to interfere lupins going to run into the forest right at ushermione gaspedquick she moaned dashing to untie buckbeak quick where are we going to go where are we going to hide the dementors wilt be coming any moment back to hagrids harry said its empty now come onthey ran as fast as they could buckbeak cantering along behind themthey could hear the werewolf howling behind themthe cabin was in sight harry skidded to the door wrenched it open and hermione and buckbeak flashed past him harry threw himself in after them and bolted the door fang the boarhound barked loudlyshh fang its us said hermione hurrying over and scratching his ears to quieten him that was really close she said to harryyeahharry was looking out of the window it was much harder to see what wasgoing on from here buckbeak seemed very happy to find himself back inside hagrids house he lay down in front of the fire folded his wings contentedly and seemed ready for a good napi think id better go outside again you know said harry slowly i cant see whats going on we wont know when its time hermione looked up her expression was suspiciousim not going to try and interfere said harry quickly but if we dont see whats going on howre we going to know when its time to rescue siriuswell okay then ill wait here with buckbeak but harry be careful theres a werewolf out there and the dementors harry stepped outside again and edged around the cabin he could hear yelping in the distance that meant the dementors were closing in on sirius he and hermione would be running to him any momentharry stared out toward the lake his heart doing a kind of drumroll in his chest whoever had sent that patronus would be appearing at any momentfor a fraction of a second he stood irresolute in front of hagrids door you must not be seen but he didnt want to be seen he wanted to do the seeing he had to knowand there were the dementors they were emerging out of the darkness from every direction gliding around the edges of the lake they were moving away from where harry stood to the opposite bank he wouldnt have to get near themharry began to run he had no thought in his head except his fatherif it was him if it really was him he had to know had to find outthe lake was coming nearer and nearer but there was no sign of anybodyon the opposite bank he could see tiny glimmers of silver his own attempts at a patronus there was a bush at the very edge of the water harry threw himself behind it peering desperately through the leaves on the opposite bankthe glimmers of silver were suddenly extinguished a terrified excitement shot through him any moment now come on he muttered staring about where are you dad come on but no one came harry raised his head to look at the circle of dementors across the lake one of them was lowering its hood it was time for the rescuer to appear but no one was coming to help this time and then it hit him he understood he hadnt seen his father he had seen himself harry flung himself out from behind the bush and pulled out his wandexpecto patronum he yelledand out of the end of his wand burst not a shapeless cloud of mist but a blinding dazzling silver animal he screwed up his eyes trying to see what it was it looked like a horse it was galloping silently away from him across the black surface of the lake he saw it lower its head and charge at the swarming dementors now it was galloping around and around the black shapes on the ground and the dementors were falling back scattering retreating into the darkness they were gonethe patronus turned it was cantering back toward harry across the still surface of the water it wasnt a horse it wasnt a unicorn either it was a stag it was shining brightly as the moon above it was coming back to himit stopped on the bank its hooves made no mark on the soft ground as it stared at harry with its large silver eyes slowly it bowed its antlered head and harry realized prongs he whisperedbut as his trembling fingertips stretched toward the creature it vanishedharry stood there hand still outstretched then with a great leap of his heart he heard hooves behind him he whirled around and saw hermione dashing toward him dragging buckbeak behind herwhat did you do she said fiercely you said you were only going to keep a lookouti just saved all our lives said harry get behind here behind this bush ill explainhermione listened to what had just happened with her mouth open yet againdid anyone see youyes havent you been listening i saw me but i thought i was my dadits okayharry i cant believe it you conjured up a patronus that drove away all those dementors thats very very advanced magic i knew i could do it this time said harry because id already done itdoes that make sensei dont know harry look at snapetogether they peered around the bush at the other bank snape had regained consciousness he was conjuring stretchers and lifting the limp forms of harry hermione and black onto them a fourth stretcher no doubt bearing ron was already floating at his side then wand held out in front of him he moved them away toward the castleright its nearly time said hermione tensely looking at her watchweve got about forty five minutes until dumbledore locks the door to the hospital wing weve got to rescue sirius and get back into the ward before anybody realizes were missing they waited watching the moving clouds reflected in the lake while the bush next to them whispered in the breeze buckbeak bored was ferreting for worms againd you reckon hes up there yet said harry checking his watch he looked up at the castle and began counting the windows to the right of the west towerlook hermione whispered \whos that someones coming back out of the castleharry stared through the darkness the man was hurrying across the grounds toward one of the entrances something shiny glinted in his beltmacnair said harry the executioner hes gone to get the dementorsthis is it hermione hermione put her hands on buckbeaks back and harry gave her a leg upthen he placed his foot on one of the lower branches of the bush and climbed up in front of her he pulled buckbeaks rope back over his neck and tied it to the other side of his collar like reinsready he whispered to hermione yotm better hold on to me he nudged buckbeaks sides with his heelsbuckbeak soared straight into the dark air harry gripped his flanks with his knees feeling the great wings rising powerfully beneath themhermione was holding harry very tight around the waist he could hear her muttering oh no i dont like this oh i really dont like this harry urged buckbeak forward they were gliding quietly toward the upper floors of the castle harry pulled hard on the left hand side of the rope and buckbeak turned harry was trying to count the windows flashing past whoa he said pulling backward as hard as he couldbuckbeak slowed down and they found themselves at a stop unless you counted the fact that they kept rising up and down several feet as the hippogriff beat his wings to remain airbornehes there harry said spotting sirius as they rose up beside the window he reached out and as buckbeaks wings fell was able to tap sharply on the glassblack looked up harry saw his jaw drop he leapt from his chairhurried to the window and tried to open it but it was lockedstand back hermione called to him and she took out her wand still gripping the back of harrys robes with her left handalohomorathe window sprang openhow how said black weakly staring at the hippogriff get on theres not much time said harry gripping buckbeak firmly on either side of his sleek neck to hold him steady youve got to get out of here the dementors are coming macnairs gone to get themblack placed a hand on either side of the window frame and heaved his head and shoulders out of it it was very lucky he was so thin in seconds he had managed to fling one leg over buckbeaks back and pull himself onto the hippogriff behind hermioneokay buckbeak up said harry shaking the rope up to the tower come onthe hippogriff gave one sweep of its mighty wings and they were soaring upward again high as the top of the west tower buckbeak landed with a clatter on the battlements and harry and hermione slid off him at oncesirius youd better go quick harry panted theyll reach flitwicks office any moment theyll find out youre gonebuckbeak pawed the ground tossing his sharp headwhat happened to the other boy ron croaked siriushes going to be okay hes still out of it but madam pomfrey saysshell be able to make him better quick go but black was still staring down at harryhow can i ever thank go harry and hermione shouted togetherblack wheeled buckbeak around facing the open skywell see each other again he said you are truly your fathers son harryhe squeezed buckbeaks sides with his heels harry and hermione jumped back as the enormous wings rose once more the hippogriff took off into the air he and his rider became smaller and smaller as harry gazed after them then a cloud drifted across the moon they were gonechapter twenty two owl post againharryhermione was tugging at his sleeve staring at her watch weve got exactly ten minutes to get back down to the hospital wing without anybody seeing us before dumbledore locks the door okay said harry wrenching his gaze from the sky lets gothey slipped through the doorway behind them and down a tightly spiraling stone staircase as they reached the bottom of it they heard voices they flattened themselves against the wall and listened it sounded like fudge and snape they were walking quickly along the corridor at the foot of the staircaseonly hope dumbledores not going to make difficulties snape was saying the kiss will be performed immediatelyas soon as macnair returns with the dementors this whole black affair has been highly embarrassing i cant tell you how much im looking forward to informing the daily prophet that weve got him at last i daresay theyll want to interview you snape and once young harrys back in his right mind i expect hell want to tell the prophet exactly how you saved himharry clenched his teeth he caught a glimpse of snapes smirk as he and fudge passed harry and hermiones hiding place their footsteps died away harry and hermione waited a few moments to make sure theyd really gone then started to run in the opposite direction down one staircasethen another along a new corridor then they heard a cackling aheadpeeves harry muttered grabbing hermiones wrist in herethey tore into a deserted classroom to their left just in time peeves seemed to be bouncing along the corridor in boisterous good spiritslaughing his head offoh hes horrible whispered hermione her ear to the door i bet hes all excited because the dementors are going to finish off sirius she checked her watch three minutes harrythey waited until peevess gloating voice had faded into the distancethen slid back out of the room and broke into a run againhermione whatll happen if we dont get back inside before dumbledore locks the door harry pantedi dont want to think about it hermione moaned checking her watch again one minutethey had reached the end of the corridor with the hospital wing entrance okay i can hear dumbledore said hermione tensely come on harrythey crept along the corridor the door opened dumbledores back appearedi am going to lock you in they heard him saying it is five minutesto midnight miss granger three turns should do it good luckdumbledore backed out of the room closed the door and took out his wand to magically lock it panicking harry and hermione ran forwarddumbledore looked up and a wide smile appeared under the long silver mustache well he said quietlywe did it said harry breathlessly sirius has gone on buckbeakdumbledore beamed at themwell done i think he listened intently for any sound within the hospital wing yes i think youve gone too get inside ill lock you in harry and hermione slipped back inside the dormitory it was empty except for ron who was still lying motionless in the end bed as the lock clicked behind them harry and hermione crept back to their own beds hermione tucking the time turner back under her robes a moment later madam pomfrey came striding back out of her officedid i hear the headmaster leaving am i allowed to look after my patients nowshe was in a very bad mood harry and hermione thought it best to accept their chocolate quietly madam pomfrey stood over them making sure they ate it but harry could hardly swallow he and hermione were waitinglistening their nerves jangling and then as they both took a fourth piece of chocolate from madam pomfrey they heard a distant roar of fury echoing from somewhere above themwhat was that said madam pomfrey in alarmnow they could hear angry voices growing louder and louder madam pomfrey was staring at the doorreally theyll wake everybody up what do they think theyre doingharry was trying to hear what the voices were saying they were drawing nearer he must have disapparated severus we should have left somebody in the room with him when this gets out he didnt disapparate snape roared now very close at hand you cant apparate or disapparate inside this castle this has something to do with potterseverus be reasonable harry has been locked up bamthe door of the hospital wing burst openfudge snape and dumbledore came striding into the ward dumbledore alone looked calm indeed he looked as though he was quite enjoying himself fudge appeared angry but snape was beside himselfout with it potter he bellowed what did you doprofessor snape shrieked madam pomfrey control yourselfsee here snape be reasonable said fudge this doors been lockedwe just saw they helped him escape i know it snape howled pointing at harry and hermione his face was twisted spit was flying from his mouthcalm down man fudge barked youre talking nonsenseyou dont know potter shrieked snape he did it i know he did it that will do severus said dumbledore quietly think about what you are saying this door has been locked since i left the ward ten minutes ago madam pomfrey have these students left their bedsof course not said madam pomfrey bristling i would have heard themwell there you have it severus said dumbledore calmly unless you are suggesting that harry and hermione are able to be in two places at once im afraid i dont see any point in troubling them furthersnape stood there seething staring from fudge who looked thoroughly shocked at his behavior to dumbledore whose eyes were twinkling behind his glasses snape whirled about robes swishing behind him and stormed out of the wardfellow seems quite unbalanced said fudge staring after him id watch out for him if i were you dumbledoreoh hes not unbalanced said dumbledore quietly hes just suffered a severe disappointmenthes not the only one puffed fudge the daily prophets going to have a field day we had black cornered and he slipped through our fingers yet again all it needs now is for the story of that hippogriffs escape to get out and ill be a laughingstock well id better go and notify the ministryand the dementors said dumbledore theyll be removed from the school i trustoh yes theyll have to go said fudge running his fingers distractedly through his hair never dreamed theyd attempt to administer the kiss on an innocent boy completely out of controlno ill have them packed off back to azkaban tonight perhaps we should think about dragons at the school entrancehagrid would like that said dumbledore smiling at harry and hermione as he and fudge left the dormitory madam pomfrey hurried to the door and locked it again muttering angrily to herself she headed back to her officethere was a low moan from the other end of the ward ron had woken upthey could see him sitting up rubbing his head looking aroundwhat what happened he groaned harry why are we in here wheres sirius wheres lupin whats going onharry and hermione looked at each otheryou explain said harry helping himself to some more chocolatewhen harry ron and hermione left the hospital wing at noon the next day it was to find an almost deserted castle the sweltering heat and the end of the exams meant that everyone was taking full advantage of another hogsmeade visit neither ron nor hermione felt like goinghowever so they and harry wandered onto the grounds still talking about the extraordinary events of the previous night and wondering where sirius and buckbeak were now sitting near the lake watching the giant squid waving its tentacles lazily above the water harry lost the thread of the conversation as he looked across to the opposite bank the stag had galloped toward him from there just last nighta shadow fell across them and they looked tip to see a very bleary eyed hagrid mopping his sweaty face with one of his tablecloth sized handkerchiefs and beaming down at themknow i shouldn feel happy after wha happened las night he saidi mean black escapin again an everythin but guess whatwhat they said pretending to look curiousbeaky he escaped hes free bin celebratin all nightthats wonderful said hermione giving ron a reproving look because he looked as though he was close to laughingyeah cantve tied him up properly said hagrid gazing happily out over the grounds i was worried this mornin mind thought he mighta met professor lupin on the grounds but lupin says he never ate anythin las nightwhat said harry quicklyblimey haven yeh heard said hagrid his smile fading a little he lowered his voice even though there was nobody in sight er snape told all the slytherins this mornin thought everyoned know by now professor lupins a werewolf see an he was loose on the grounds las night hes packin now o coursehes packing said harry alarmed whyleavin isn he said hagrid looking surprised that harry had to ask resigned firs thing this mornin says he cant risk it happenin againharry scrambled to his feetim going to see him he said to ron and hermionebut if hes resigned doesnt sound like theres anything we can do i dont care i still want to see him ill meet you back herelupins office door was open he had already packed most of his thingsthe grindylows empty tank stood next to his battered old suitcasewhich was open and nearly full lupin was bending over something on his desk and looked up only when harry knocked on the doori saw you coming said lupin smiling he pointed to the parchment he had been poring over it was the marauders mapi just saw hagrid said harry and he said youd resigned its not true is itim afraid it is said lupin he started opening his desk drawers and taking out the contentswhy said harry the ministry of magic dont think you were helping sirius do theylupin crossed to the door and closed it behind harryno professor dumbledore managed to convince fudge that i was trying to save your lives he sighed that was the final straw for severus i think the loss of the order of merlin hit him hard so he er accidentally let slip that i am a werewolf this morning at breakfastyoure not leaving just because of that said harrylupin smiled wrylythis time tomorrow the owls will start arriving from parents they will not want a werewolf teaching their children harry and after last night i see their point i could have bitten any of you that must never happen againyoure the best defense against the dark arts teacher weve ever hadsaid harry dont golupin shook his head and didnt speak he carried on emptying his drawers then while harry was trying to think of a good argument to make him stay lupin said from what the headmaster told me this morning you saved a lot of lives last night harry if im proud of anything ive done this year its how much youve learned tell me about your patronushow dyou know about that said harry distractedwhat else could have driven the dementors backharry told lupin what had happened when hed finished lupin was smiling againyes your father was always a stag when he transformed he said you guessed right thats why we called him prongslupin threw his last few books into his case closed the desk drawersand turned to look at harryhere i brought this from the shrieking shack last night he saidhanding harry back the invisibility cloak and he hesitated then held out the marauders map too i am no longer your teacher so i dont feel guilty about giving you back this as well its no use to meand i daresay you ron and hermione will find uses for itharry took the map and grinnedyou told me moony wormtail padfoot and prongs wouldve wanted to lure me out of school you said theyd have thought it was funnyand so we would have said lupin now reaching down to close his casei have no hesitation in saying that james would have been highly disappointed if his son had never found any of the secret passages out of the castlethere was a knock on the door harry hastily stuffed the marauders map and the invisibility cloak into his pocketit was professor dumbledore he didnt look surprised to see harry thereyour carriage is at the gates remus he saidthank you headmasterlupin picked up his old suitcase and the empty grindylow tankwell good bye harry he said smiling it has been a real pleasure teaching you i feel sure well meet again sometimeheadmaster there is no need to see me to the gates i can manageharry had the impression that lupin wanted to leave as quickly as possiblegood bye then remus said dumbledore soberly lupin shifted the grindylow tank slightly so that he and dumbledore could shake handsthen with a final nod to harry and a swift smile lupin left the officeharry sat down in his vacated chair staring glumly at the floor heheard the door close and looked up dumbledore was still therewhy so miserable harry he said quietly you should be very proud of yourself after last nightit didnt make any difference said harry bitterly pettigrew got awaydidnt make any difference said dumbledore quietly it made all the difference in the world harry you helped uncover the truth you saved an innocent man from a terrible fateterrible something stirred in harrys memory greater and more terrible than ever before professor trelawneys predictionprofessor dumbledore yesterday when i was having my divination exam professor trelawney went very very strangeindeed said dumbledore er stranger than usual you meanyes her voice went all deep and her eyes rolled and she said she said voldemorts servant was going to set out to return to him before midnight she said the servant would help him come back to powerharry stared up at dumbledore and then she sort of became normal again and she couldnt remember anything shed said was it was she making a real predictiondumbledore looked mildly impresseddo you know harry i think she might have been he said thoughtfullywhod have thought it that brings her total of real predictions up to two i should offer her a pay raisebut harry looked at him aghast how could dumbledore take this so calmlybut i stopped sirius and professor lupin from killing pettigrewthat makes it my fault if voldemort comes backit does not said dumbledore quietly hasnt your experience with thetime turner taught you anything harry the consequences of our actions are always so complicated so diverse that predicting the future is a very difficult business indeed professor trelawney bless her is living proof of that you did a very noble thing in saving pettigrews lifebut if he helps voldemort back to power pettigrew owes his life to you you have sent voldemort a deputy who is in your debt when one wizard saves another wizards life it creates a certain bond between them and im much mistaken if voldemort wants his servant in the debt of harry potteri dont want a connection with pettigrew said harry he betrayed my parentsthis is magic at its deepest its most impenetrable harry but trust me the time may come when you will be very glad you saved pettigrews lifeharry couldnt imagine when that would be dumbledore looked as though he knew what harry was thinkingi knew your father very well both at hogwarts and later harry he said gently he would have saved pettigrew too i am sure of itharry looked up at him dumbledore wouldnt laugh he could tell dumbledorei thought it was my dad whod conjured my patronus i mean when i saw myself across the lake i thought i was seeing him an easy mistake to make said dumbledore softly i expect youll tire of hearing itbut you do look extraordinarily like james except for the eyes you have your mothers eyesharry shook his headit was stupid thinking it was him he muttered i mean i knew he was deadyou think the dead we loved ever truly leave us you think that we dont recall them more clearly than ever in times of great trouble your father is alive in you harry and shows himself most plainly when you have need of him how else could you produce that particular patronusprongs rode again last nightit took a moment for harry to realize what dumblefore had saidlast night sirius told me all about how they became animagi said dumbledore smiling an extraordinary achievement not least keeping it quiet from me and then i remembered the most unusual form your patronus took when it charged mr malfoy down at your quidditch match against ravenclaw you know harry in a way you did see your father last night you found him inside yourselfand dumbledore left the office leaving harry to his very confused thoughtsnobody at hogwarts now knew the truth of what had happened the night that sirius buckbeak and pettigrew had vanished except harry ronhermione and professor dumbledore as the end of term approached harry heard many different theories about what had really happened but none of them came close to the truthmalfoy was furious about buckbeak he was convinced that hagrid had found a way of smuggling the hippogriff to safety and seemed outraged that he and his father had been outwitted by a gamekeeper percy weasley meanwhile had much to say on the subject of siriuss escapeif i manage to get into the ministry ill have a lot of proposals to make about magical law enforcement he told the only person who would listen his girlfriend penelopethough the weather was perfect though the atmosphere was so cheerful though he knew they had achieved the near impossible in helping sirius to freedom harry had never approached the end of a school year in worse spiritshe certainly wasnt the only one who was sorry to see professor lupingo the whole of harrys defense against the dark arts class was miserable about his resignationwonder what theyll give us next year said seamus finnigan gloomilymaybe a vampire suggested dean thomas hopefullyit wasnt only professor lupins departure that was weighing on harrys mind he couldnt help thinking a lot about professor trelawneys prediction he kept wondering where pettigrew was now whether he had sought sanctuary with voldemort yet but the thing that was lowering harrys spirits most of all was the prospect of returning to the dursleys for maybe half an hour a glorious half hour he had believed he would be living with sirius from now on his parents best friend it would have been the next best thing to having his own father back and while no news of sirius was definitely good newsbecause it meant he had successfully gone into hiding harry couldnt help feeling miserable when he thought of the home he might have hadand the fact that it was now impossiblethe exam results came out on the last day of term harry ron and hermione had passed every subject harry was amazed that he had got through potions he had a shrewd suspicion that dumbledore might have stepped in to stop snape failing him on purpose snapes behavior toward harry over the past week had been quite alarming harry wouldnt have thought it possible that snapes dislike for him could increase but it certainly had a muscle twitched unpleasantly at the corner of snapes thin mouth every time he looked at harry and he was constantly flexing his fingers as though itching to place them around harrys throatpercy had got his top grade newts fred and george had scraped a handful of owls each gryffindor house meanwhile largely thanks to their spectacular performance in the quidditch cup had won the house championship for the third year running this meant that the end of term feast took place amid decorations of scarlet and gold and that the gryffindor table was the noisiest of the lot as everybody celebratedeven harry managed to forget about the journey back to the dursleys the next day as he ate drank talked and laughed with the restas the hogwarts express pulled out of the station the next morninghermione gave harry and ron some surprising newsi went to see professor mcgonagall this morning just before breakfastive decided to drop muggle studiesbut you passed your exam with three hundred and twenty percent said roni know sighed hermione but i cant stand another year like this one that time turner it was driving me mad ive handed it in without muggle studies and divination ill be able to have a normal schedule againi still cant believe you didnt tell us about it said ron grumpilywere supposed to be your friendsi promised i wouldnt tell anyone said hermione severely she

thinking about the holidaysyeah ive been thinking about them too said ron harry youve got to come and stay with us ill fix it up with mum and dad then ill call you i know how to use a fellytone now a telephone ron said hermione honestly you should take muggle studies next yearron ignored herits the quidditch world cup this summer how about it harry come and stay and well go and see it dad can usually get tickets from workthis proposal had the effect of cheering harry up a great dealyeah i bet the dursleysd be pleased to let me come especially after what i did to aunt margefeeling considerably more cheerful harry joined ron and hermione in several games of exploding snap and when the witch with the tea cart arrived he bought himself a very large lunch though nothing with chocolate in itbut it was late in the afternoon before the thing that made him truly happy turned upharry said hermione suddenly peering over his shoulder whats that thing outside your windowharry turned to look outside something very small and gray was bobbing in and out of sight beyond the glass he stood up for a better look and saw that it was a tiny owl carrying a letter that was much too big for it the owl was so small in fact that it kept tumbling over in the air buffeted this way and that in the trains slipstream harry quickly pulled down the window stretched out his arm and caught it it felt like a very fluffy snitch he brought it carefully inside the owl dropped its letter onto harrys seat and began zooming around their compartment apparently very pleased with itself for accomplishing its task hedwig clicked her beak with a sort of dignified disapprovalcrookshanks sat up in his seat following the owl with his great yellow eyes ron noticing this snatched the owl safely out of harms wayharry picked up the letter it was addressed to him he ripped open the letter and shouted its from siriuswhat said ron and hermione excitedly read it alouddear harryi hope this finds you before you reach your aunt and uncle i dont know whether theyre used to owl postbuckbeak and i are in hiding i wont tell you where in case this owl falls into the wrong hands i have some doubt about his reliability but he is the best i could find and he did seem eager for the jobi believe the dementors are still searching for me but they havent ahope of finding me here i am planning to

enjoyableif ever you need me send word your owl will find meill write again soonsirius harry looked eagerly inside the envelope there was another piece of parchment in there he read it through quickly and felt suddenly as warm and contented as though hed swallowed a bottle of hot butterbeer in one gulpi sirius black harry potters godfather hereby give him permission to visit hogsmeade on weekendsthatll be good enough for dumbledore said harry happily he looked back at siriuss letter hang on theres a rsi thought your ftiend ron might like to keep this owl as its my fault he no longer

for crookshanks to sniffwhat do you reckon ron asked the cat definitely an owlcrookshanks purredthats good enough for me said ron happily hes mineharry read and reread the letter from sirius all the way back into kings cross station it was still clutched tightly in his hand as heron and hermione stepped back through the barrier of platform nine an three quarters harry spotted uncle vernon at once he was standing a good distance from mr and mrs weasley eyeing them suspiciously and when mrs weasley hugged harry in greeting his worst suspicions about them seemed confirmedill call about the world cup ron yelled after harry as harry bid him and hermione good bye then wheeled the trolley bearing his trunk and hedwigs cage toward uncle vernon who greeted him in his usual fashionwhats that he

goblet of firechapter one the riddle housethe villagers of little hangleron still called it the riddle house even though it had been many years since the riddle family had lived there it stood on a hill overlooking the village some of its windows boarded tiles missing from its roof and ivy spreading unchecked over its face once a finelooking manor and easily the largest and grandest building for miles around the riddle house was now damp derelict and unoccupiedthe little hagletons all agreed that the old house was creepy half a century ago something strange and horrible had happened there something that the older inhabitants of the village still liked to discuss when topics for gossip were scarce the story had been picked over so many times and had been embroidered in so many places that nobody was quite sure what the truth was anymore every version of the tale however started in the same place fifty years before at daybreak on a fine summers morning when the riddle house had still been well kept and impressive a maid had entered the drawing room to find all three riddles dead the maid had run screaming down the hill into the village and roused as many people as she couldlying there with their eyes wide open cold as ice still in their dinner thingsthe police were summoned and the whole of little hangleton had seethed with shocked curiosity and illdisguised excitement nobody wasted their breath pretending to feel very sad about the riddles for they had been most unpopular elderly mr and mrs riddle had been rich snobbish and rude and their grownup son tom had been if anything worse all the villagers cared about was the identity of their murderer for plainly three apparently healthy people did not all drop dead of natural causes on the same nightthe hanged man the village pub did a roaring trade that night the whole village seemed to have turned out to discuss the murders they were rewarded for leaving their firesides when the riddles cook arrived dramatically in their midst and announced to the suddenly silent pub that a man called frank bryce had just been arrestedfrank cried several people neverfrank bryce was the riddles gardener he lived alone in a rundown cottage on the grounds of the riddle house frank had come back from the war with a very stiff leg and a great dislike of crowds and loud noises and had been working for the riddles ever sincethere was a rush to buy the cook drinks and hear more detailsalways thought he was odd she told the eagerly listening villagers after her fourth sherry unfriendly like im sure if ive offered him a cuppa once ive offered it a hundred times never wanted to mix he didntah now said a woman at the bar he had a hard war frank he likes the quiet life thats no reason to who else had a key to the back door then barked the cook theres been a spare key hanging in the gardeners cottage far back as i can remember nobody forced the door last night no broken windows all frank had to do was creep up to the big house while we was all sleepingthe villagers exchanged dark looksi always thought that he had a nasty look about him right enough grunted a man at the barwar turned him funny if you ask me said the landlordtold you i wouldnt like to get on the wrong side of frank didnt i dot said an excited woman in the cornerhorrible temper said dot nodding fervently i remember when he was a kidby the following morning hardly anyone in little hangleton doubted that frank bryce had killed the riddlesbut over in the neighboring town of great hangleton in the dark and dingy police station frank was stubbornly repeating again and again that he was innocent and that the only person he had seen near the house on the day of the riddles deaths had been a teenage boy a stranger darkhaired and pale nobody else in the village had seen any such boy and the police were quite sure frank had invented himthen just when things were looking very serious for frank the report on the riddles bodies came back and changed everythingthe police had never read an odder report a team of doctors had examined the bodies and had concluded that none of the riddles had been poisoned stabbed shot strangles suffocated or as far as they could tell harmed at all in fact the report continued in a tone of unmistakable bewilderment the riddles all appeared to be in perfet health apart from the fact that they were all dead the doctors did note as though determined to find something wrong with the bodies that each of the riddles had a look of terror upon his or her face but as the frustrated police said whoever heard of three people being frightened to deathas there was no proof that the riddles had been murdered at all the police were forced to let frank go the riddles were buried in the little hangleton churchyard and their graves remained objects of curiosity for a while to everyones surprise and amid a cloud of suspicion frank bryce returned to his cottage on the grounds of the riddle houses far as im concerned he killed them and i dont care what the police say said dot in the hanged man and if he had any decency hed leave here knowing as how we knows he did itbut frank did not leave he stayed to tend the garden for the next family who lived in the riddle house and then the next for neither family stayed long perhaps it was partly because of frank that the new owners said there was a nasty feeling about the place which in the absence of inhabitants started to fall into disrepairthe wealthy man who owned the riddle house these days neither lived there nor put it to any use they said in the village that he kept it for tax reasons though nobody was very clear what these might be the wealthy owner continued to pay frank to do the gardening however frank was nearing his seventyseventh birthday now very deaf his bad leg stiffer than ever but could be seen pottering around the flower beds in fine weather even though the weeds were starting to creep up on him try as he might to suppress themweeds were not the only things frank had to contend with either boys from the village made a habit of throwing stones through the windows of the riddle house they rode their bicycles over the lawns frank worked so hard to keep smooth once or twice they broke into the old house for a dare they knew that old franks devotion to the house and the grounds amounted almost to an obsession and it amused them to see him limping across the garden brandishing his stick and yelling croakily at them frank for his part believed the boys tormented him because they like their parents and grandparents though him a murderer so when frank awoke one night in august and saw something very odd up at the old house he merely assumed that the boys had gone one step further in their attempts to punish himit was franks bad leg that woke him it was paining him worse than ever in his old age he got up and limped downstairs into the kitchen with the idea of refilling his hotwater bottle to ease the stiffness in his knee standing at the sink filling the kettle he looked up at the riddle house and saw lights glimmering in its upper windows frank knew at once what was going on the boys had broken into the house again and judging by the flickering quality of the light they had started a firefrank had no telephone in any case he had deeply mistrusted the police ever since they had taken him in for questioning about the riddles deaths he put down the kettle at once hurried back upstairs as fast as his bad leg would allow and was soon back in his kitchen fully dressed and removing a rusty old key from its hook by the door he picked up his walking stick which was propped against the wall and set off into the night the front door of the riddle house bore no sign of being forced nor did any of the windows frank limped around to the back of the house until he reached a door almost completely hidden by ivy took out the old key put it into the lock and opened the door noiselesslyhe let himself into the cavernous kitchen frank had not entered it for many years nevertheless although it was very dark he remembered where the door into the hall was and he groped his way towards it his nostrils full of the smell of decay ears pricked for any sound of footsteps or voices from overhead he reached the hall which was a little lighter owing to the large mullioned windows on either side of the front door and started to climb the stairs blessing the dust that lay thick upon the stone because it muffled the sound of his feet and stickon the landing frank turned right and saw at once where the intruders were at the every end of the passage a door stood ajar and a flickering light shone through the gap casting a long sliver of gold across the black floor frank edged closer and closer he was able to see a narrow slice of the room beyondthe fire he now saw had been lit in the grate this surprised him then he stopped moving and listened intently for a mans voice spoke within the room it sounded timid and fearfulthere is a little more in the bottle my lord if you are still hungrylater said a second voice this too belonged to a man but it was strangely highpitched and cold as a sudden blast of icy wind something about that voice made the sparse hairs on the back of franks neck stand up move me closer to the fire wormtailfrank turned his right ear toward the door the better to hear there came the clink of a bottle being put down upon some hard surface and then the dull scraping noise of a heavy chair being dragged across the floor frank caught a glimpse of a small man his back to the door pushing the chair into place he was wearing a long black cloak and there was a bald patch at the back of his head then he went out of sight againwhere is nagini said the cold voicei i dont know my lord said the first voice nervously she set out to explore the house i thinkyou will milk her before we retire wormtail said the second voice i will need feeding in the night the journey has tired me greatlybrow furrowed frank inclined his good ear still closer to the door listening very hard there was a pause and then the man called wormtail spoke againmy lord may i ask how long we are going to stay herea week said the cold voice perhapse longer the place is moderately comfortable and the plan cannot proceed yet it would be foolish to act before the quidditch world cup is overfrank inserted a gnarled finger into his ear and rotated it owing no doubt to a buildup of earwax he had heard the word quidditch which was not a word at allthe the quidditch world cup my lord said wormtail frank dug his finger still more vigorously into his ear forgive me but i do not understand why should we wait until the world cup is overbecause fool at this very moment wizards are pouring into the country from all over the world and every meddler from the ministry of magic will be on duty on the watch for signs of ususual activity checking and doublechecking identities they will be obsessed with security lest the muggles notice anything so we waitfrank stopped trying to clear out his ear he had distinctly heard the words ministry of magic wizards and muggles plainly each of these expressions meant something secret and frank could think of only two sorts of people who would speak in code spies and criminals frank tightened his hold on his walking stick once more and listened more closely stillyour lordship is still determined then wormtail said quietlycertainly i am determined wormtail there was a note of menace in the cold voice nowa slight pause followed and the wormtail spoke the words tumbling from him in a rush as though he was forcing himself to say this before he lost his nerveit could be done without harry potter my lordanother pause more protracted and then without harry potter breathed the second voice softly i seemy lord i do not say this out of concern for the boy said wormtail his voice rising squeakily the boy is nothing to me nothing at all it is merely that if we were to use another witch or wizard any wizard the thing could be done so much more quickly if you allowed me to leave you for a short while you know that i can disguise myself most effectively i could be back here in as little as two days with a suitable person i could use another wizard said the cold voice softly that is truemy lord it makes sense said wormtail sounding thoroughly relieved now laying hands on harry potter would be so difficult he is so well protected and so you volunteer to go and fetch me a substitute i wonderperhaps the task of nursing me has become wearisome for you wormtail could this suggestion of abandoning the plan be nothing more than an attempt to desert memy lord i i have no wish to leave you none at all do not lie to me hissed the second voice i can always tell wormtail you are regretting that you ever returned to me i revolt you i see you flinch when you look at me feel you shudder when you touch meno my devotion to your lordship your devotion is nothing more than cowardice you would not be here if you had anywhere else to go how am i to survive without you when i need feeding every few hours who is to milk naginibut you seem so much stronger my lord liar breathed the second voice i am no stronger and a few days alone would be enough to rob me of the little health i have regained under your clumsy care silencewormtail who had been sputtering incoherently fell silent at once for a few seconds frank could hear nothing but the fire crackling the the second man spoke once more in a whisper that was almost a hissi have my reasons for using the boy as i have already explained to you and i will use no other i have waited thirteen years a few more months will make no difference as for the protection surrounding the boy i believe my plan will be effective all that is needed is a little courage from you wormtail courage you will find unless you wish to feel the full extent of lord voldermorts wrath my lord i must speak said wormtail panic in his voice now all through our journey i have gone over the plan in my head my lord bertha jorkins disappearance will not go unnoticed for long and if we proceed if i murder if whispered the second voice if if you follow the plan wormtail the ministry need never know that anyone else has died you will do it quietly and without fuss i only wish that i could do it myself but in my present conditioncome wormtail one more death and our path to harry potter is clear i am not asking you to do it alone by that time my faithful serant will have rejoined us i am a faithful servant said wormtail the merest trace of sullenness in his voicewormtail i need somebody with brains somebody whose loyalty has never wavered and you unfortunately fulfill neither requirementi found you said wormtail and there was definitely a sulky edge to his voice now i was the one who found you i brought you bertha jorkinsthat is true said the second man sounding amused a stroke of brilliance i would not have thought possible from you wormtail though if truth be told you were not aware how useful she would be when you caught her were youi i thought she might be useful my lord liar said the second voice again the cruel amusement more pronounced than ever however i do not deny that her information was invaluable without it i could never have formed our plan and for that you will have your reward wormtail i will allow you to perform an essential task for me one that many of my followers would give their right hands to performrreally my lord what wormtail sounded terrified againah wormtail you dont want me to spoil the surprise your part will come at the very endbut i promise you you will have the honor of being just as useful as bertha jorkinsyouyou wormtails voice suddenly sounded hoarse as though his mouth had gone very dry youare goingto kill me toowormtail wormtail said the cold voice silkily why would i kill you i killed bertha because i had to she was fit for nothing after my questioning quite useless in any case awkward questions would have been asked if she had gone back to the ministry with the news that she had met you on her holidays wizards who are supposed to be dead would do well not to run into ministry of magic witches at wayside innswormtail muttered something so quietly that frank could not hear it but it made the second man laugh an entirely mirthless laugh cold as his speechwe could have modified her memory but memory charms can be broken by a powerful wizard as i proved when i questioned her it would be an insult to her memory not to use the information i extracted from her wormtailout in the corridor frank suddenly became aware that the hand gripping his walking stick was slippery with sweat the man with the cold voice had killed a woman he was talking about it without any kind of remorse with amusement he was dangerous a madman and he was planning more murders this boy harry potter whoever he was was in danger frank knew what he must do now if ever was the time to go to the police he would creep out of the house and head straight for the telephone box in the villagebut the cold voice was speaking again and frank remained where he was frozen to the spot listening with all his mightone more murdermy faithful servant at hogwartsharry potter is as good as mine wormtail it is decided there will be no more argument but quieti think i hear naginiand the second mans voice changed he started making noises such as frank had never heard before he was hissing and spitting without drawing breath frank thought he must be having some sort of fit or seizureand then frank heard movement behind him in the dark passageway he turned to look and found himself paralyzed with frightsomething was slithering toward him along the dark corridor floor and as it drew nearer to the sliver of firelight he realized with a thrill of terror that it was a gigantic snake at least twelve feet long horrified transfixed frank stared as its undulating body cut a wide curving track through the thick dust on the floor coming closer and closer what was he to do the only means of escape was into the room where the two men sat plotting murder yet if he stayed where he was the snake would surely kill him but before he had made his decision the snake was level with him and then incredibly miraculously it was passing it was following the spitting hissing noises made by the cold voice beyond the door and in seconds the tip of its diamondpatterned tail had vanished through the gapthere was sweat on franks forehead now and the hand on the walking stick was trembling inside the room the cold voice was continuing to hiss and frank was visited by a strange idea an impossible ideathis man could talk to snakesfrank didnt understand what was going on he wanted more than anything to be back in his bed with his hotwater bottle the problem was that his legs didnt seem to want to move as he stood there shaking and trying to master himself the cold voice switched abruptly to english againnagini has interesting news wormtail it saidinindeed my lord said wormtailindeed yes said the voice according to nagini there is an old muggle standing right outside this room listening to every word we sayfrank didnt have a chance to hide himself there were footsteps and then the door of the room was flung wide opena short balding man with graying hair a pointed nose and small watery eyes stood before frank a mixture of fear and alarm in his faceinvite him inside wormtail where are your mannersthe cold voice was coming from the ancient armchair before the fire but frank couldnt see the speaker the snake on the other hand was curled up on the rotting hearth rug like some horrible travesty of a pet dogwormtail beckoned frank into the room though still deeply shaken frank took a firmer grip on his walking stick and limped over the thresholdthe fire was the only source of light in the room it cast long spidery shadows upon the walls frank stared at the back of the armchair the man inside it seemed to be even smaller than his servant for frank couldnt even see the back of his headyou heard everything muggle said the cold voicewhats that youre calling me said frank defiantly for now that he was inside the room now that the time had come for some sort of action he felt braver it had always been so in the wari am calling you a muggle said the voice coolly it means that you are not a wizardi dont know what you mean by wizard said frank his voice growing steadier all i know is ive heard enough to interest the police tonight i have youve done murder and youre planning more and ill tell youthis too he added on a sudden inspiration my wife knows im up here and if i dont come back you have no wife said te cold voice very quietly nobody knows you are here you told nobody that you were coming do not lie to lord voldemort muggle for he knowshe always knowsis that right said frank roughly lord is it well i dont think much of your manners my lord turn round and face me like a man why dont youbut i am not a man muggle said the cold voice barely audible now over the crackling of the flames i am much much more than a man howeverwhy not i will face youwormtail come turn my chair aroundthe servant gave a whimperyou heard me wormtailslowly with his face screwed up as though he would rather have done anything than approach his master and the hearth rug where the snake lay the small man walked forward and began to turn the chair the snake lifted its ugly triangular head and hissed slightly as the legs of the chair snagged on its rugand then the chair was facing frank and he saw what was sitting in it his walking stick fell to the floor with a clatter he opened his mouth and let out a scream he was screaming so loudly that he never heard the words the thing in the chair spoke as it raised a wand there was a flash of green light a rushing sound and frank bryce crumpled he was dead before he hit the floortwo hundred miles away the boy called harry potter woke with a startchapter two the scarharry lay flat on his back breathing hard as though he had been running he had awoken from a vivid dream with his hands pressed over his face the old scar on his forehead which was shaped like a bolt of lightning was burning beneath his fingers as though someone had just pressed a whitehot wire to his skinhe sat up one hand still on his scar the other hand reaching out in the darkness for his glasses which were on the bedside table he put them on and his bedroom came into clearer focus lit by a faint misty orange light that was filtering through the curtains from the street lamp outside the windowharry ran his fingers over the scar again it was still painful he turned on the lamp beside him scrambled out of bed crossed the room opened his wardrobe and peered into the mirror on the inside of the door a skinny boy of fourteen looked back at him his bright green eyes puzzled under his untidy black hair he examined the lightningbolt scar of his reflection more closely it looked normal but it was still stingingharry tried to recall what he had been dreaming about before he had awoken it had seemed so realthere had been two people he knew and one he didnt he concentrated hard frowning trying to rememberthe dim picture of a darkened room came to himthere had been a snake on a hearth ruga small man called peter nicknamed wormtailand a cold high voicethe voice of lord voldemort harry felt as though an ice cube had slipped down into his stomach at the very thoughthe closed his eyes tightly and tried to remember what voldemort had looked like but it was impossibleall harry knew was that at the moment when voldemorts chair had swung around and he harry had seen what was sitting in it he had felt a spasm of horror which had awoken himor had that been the pain in his scarand who had the old man been for there had definitely been an old man harry had watched him fall to the ground it was all becoming confused harry put his face into his hands blocking out his bedroom trying to hold on to the picture of that dimly lit room but it was like trying to keep water in his cupped hands the details were now trickling away as fast as he tried to hold on to themvoldemort and wormtail had been talking about someone they had killed though harry could not remember the nameand they had been plotting to kill someone elsehimharry took his face out of his hands opened his eyes and stared around his bedroom as though expecting to see something unusual there as it happened there was an extraordinary number of unusual things in this room a large wooden trunk stood open at the foot of his bed revealing a cauldron broomstick black robes and assorted spellbooks rolls of parchment littered that part of his desk that was not taken up by the large empty cage in which his snowy owl hedwig usually perched on the floor beside his bed a book lay open harry had been reading it before he fell asleep last night the pictures in this book were all moving men in bright orange robes were zooming in and out of sight on broomsticks throwing a red ball to one anotherharry walked over to the book picked it up and watched on of the wizards score a spectacular goal by putting the ball through a fiftyfoothigh hoop then he snapped the book shut even quidditch in harrys opinion the best sport in the world couldnt distract him at the moment he placed flying with the cannons on his bedside table crossed to the window and drew back the curtains to survey the street belowprivet drive looked exactly as a respectable suburban street would be expected to look inthe early hours of saturday morning all the curtains were closed as far as harry could see through the darkness there wasnt a living creature in sight not even a catand yetand yetharry went restlessly back to the bed and sat down on it running a finger over his scar again it wasnt the pain that bothered him harry was no stranger to pain and injury he had lost all the bones from his right arm once and had them painfully regrown in a night the same arm had been pierced by a venemous footlong fang not long afterward only last year harry had fallen fifty feet from an airborn broomstick he was used to bizarre accidents and injuries they were unavoidable if you attended hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry and had a knack for attracting a lot of troubleno the thing that was bothering harry was the last time his scar had hurt him it had been because voldemort had been close bybut voldemort couldnt be here nowthe idea of voldemort lurking in privet drive was absurd impossibleharry listened closely to the silence around him was he half expecting to hear the creak of a stair or the swish of a cloak and then he jumped slightly as he heard his cousin dudley give a tremendous grunting snore from the next roomharry shook himself mentally he was being stupid there was no one in the house with him except uncle vernon aunt petunia and dudley and they were plainly still asleep their dreams untroubled and painlessasleep was the way harry liked the dursleys best it wasnt as though they were ever any help to him awake uncle vernon aunt petunia and dudley were harrys only living relatives they were muggles who hated and despised magic in any form which meant that harry was about as welcome in their house as dry rot they had explained away harrys long absences at hogwarts over the last three years by telling everyone that he went to st brutuss secure center for incurably criminal boys they knew perfectly well that as an underage wizard harry wasnt allowed to use magic outside hogwarts but they were still apt to blame him for anything that went wrong about the house harry had never been able to confide in them or tell them anything about his life in the wizarding world the very idea of going to them when they awoke and telling them about his scar hurting him and about his worries about voldemort was laughableand yet it was because of voldemort that harry had come to live with the dursleys in the first place if it hadnt been for voldemort harry would not have had the lightning scar on his forehead if it hadnt been for voldemort harry would still have had parentsharry had been a year old the night that voldemort the most powerful dark wizard for a century a wizard who had been gaining power steadily for eleven years arrived at his house and killed his father and mother voldemort had then turned his wand on harry he had performed the curse that had disposed of many fullgrown witches and wizards in his steady rise to power and incredibly it had not worked instead of killing the small boy the curse had rebounded upon voldemort harry had survived with nothing but a lightningshaped cut on his forehead and voldemort had been reduced to something barely alive his powers gone his life almost extinguished voldemort had fled the terror in which the secret community of witches and wizards had lived for so long had lifted voldemorts followers had disbanded and harry potter had become famousit had been enough of a shock for harry to discover on his eleventh birthday that he was a wizard it had been even more disconcerting to find out that everyone in the hidden wizarding world knew his name harry had arrived at hogwarts to find that heads turned and whispers followed him wherever he went but he was used to it now at the end of this summer he would be starting his fourth year at hogwarts and harry was already counting the days until he would be back at the castle againbut there was still a fortnight to go before he went back to school he looked hopelessly around his room again and his eye paused on the birthday cards his two best friends had sent him at the end of july what would they say if harry wrote to them and told them about his scar hurtingat once hermione grangers voice seemed to fill his head shrill and panickyyour scar hurt harry thats really serious write to professor dumbledore and ill go and check common magical ailments and afflictions maybe theres something in there about curse scars yes that would be hermiones advice go straight to the headmaster of hogwarts and in the meantime consult a book harry stared out of the window at the inky blueblack sky he doubted very much whether a book could help him now as far as he knew he was the only living person to have survived a curse like voldemorts it was highly unlikely therefore that he would find his symptoms listed in common magical ailments and afflictions as for informing the headmaster harry had no idea where dumbledore went during the summer holidays he amused himself for a moment picturing dumbledore with his long silver beard full length wizards robes and pointed hat stretched out on a beach somewhere rubbing suntan lotion onto his long crooked nose wherever dumbledore was though harry was sure that hedwig would be able to find him harrys owl had never yet failed to deliver a letter to anyone even without an address but what would he writedear professor dumbledore sorry to bother you but my scar hurt this morning yours sincerely harry pottereven inside his head the words sounded stupidand so he tried to imagine his other best friend ron weasleys reaction and in a moment rons red hair and longnosed freckled face seemed to swim before harry wearing a bemused expressionyour scar hurt but but youknowwho cant be near you now can he i mean youd know wouldnt you hed be trying to do you in again wouldnt be i dunno harry maybe curse scars always twinge a bit ill ask dad mr weasley was a fully qualified wizard who worked in the misuse of muggle artifacts office at the ministry of magic but he didnt have any particular expertise in the matter of curses as far as harry knew in any case harry didnt like the idea of the whole weasley family knowing that he harry was getting jumpy about a few moments pain mrs weasley would fuss worse than hermione and fred and george rons sixteen yearold twin brothers might think harry was losing his nerve the weasleys were harrys favorite family in the world he was hoping that they might invite him to stay any time now ron had mentioned something about the quidditch world cup and he somehow didnt want his visit punctuated with anxious inquiries about his scarharry kneaded his forehead with his knuckles what he really wanted and it felt almost shameful to admit it to himself was someone like someone like a parent an adult wizard whose advice he could ask without feeling stupid someone who cared about him who had had experience with dark magicand then the solution came to him it was so simple and so obvious that he couldnt believe it had taken so long siriusharry leapt up from the bed hurried across the room and sat down at his desk he pulled a piece of parchment toward him loaded his eaglefeather quill with ink wrote dear sirius then paused wondering how best to phrase his problem still marveling at the fact that he hadnt thought of sirius straight away but then perhaps it wasnt so surprising after all he had only found out that sirius was his godfather two months agothere was a simple reason for siriuss complete absence from harrys life until then sirius had been in azkaban the terrifying wizard jail guarded by creatures called dementors sightless soulsucking fiends who had come to search for sirius at hogwarts when he had escaped yet sirius had been innocent the murders for which he had been convicted had been committed by wormtail voldemorts supporter whom nearly everybody now believed dead harry ron and hermione knew otherwise however they had come facetoface with wormtail only the previous year though only professor dumbledore had believed their storyfor one glorious hour harry had believed that he was leaving the dursleys at last because sirius had offered him a home once his name had been cleared but the chance had been snatched away from him wormtail had escaped before they could take him to the ministry of magic and sirius had had to flee for his life harry had helped him escape on the back of a hippogriff called buckbeak and since then sirius had been on the run the home harry might have had if wormtail had not escaped had been haunting him all summer it had been doubly hard to return to the dursleys knowing that he had so nearly escaped them forevernevertheless sirius had been of some help to harry even if he couldnt be with him it was due to sirius that harry now had all his school things in his bedroom with him the dursleys had never allowed this before their general wish of keeping harry as miserable as possible coupled with their fear of his powers had led them to lock his school trunk in the cupboard under the stairs every summer prior to this but their attitude had changed since they had found out that harry had a dangerous murderer for a godfather for harry had conveniently forgotten to tell them that sirius was innocentharry had received two letters from sirius since he had been back at privet drive both had been delivered not by owls as was usual with wizards but by large brightly colored tropical birds hedwig had not approved of these flashy intruders she had been most reluctant to allow them to drink from her water tray before flying off again harry on the other hand had liked them they put him in mind of palm trees and white sand and he hoped that wherever sirius was sirius never said in case the letters were intercepted he was enjoying himself somehow harry found it hard to imaging dementors surviving for long in bright sunlight perhapse that was why sirius had gone south siriuss letters which were now hidden beneath the highly useful loose floorboards under harrys bed sounded chearful and in both of them he had reminded harry to call on him if ever harry needed to well he needed to right now all rightharrys lamp seemed to grow dimmer as the cold gray light that precedes sunrise slowly crept into the room finally when the sun had risen when his bedroom walls had turned gold and when sounds of movement could be heard from uncle vernon and aunt petunias room harry cleared his desk of crumpled pieces of parchment and reread his finished letterdear siriusthanks for your last letter that bird was enormous it could hardly get through my window things are the same as usual here dudleys diet isnt going too well my aunt found him smuggling doughnuts into his room yesterday they told him theyd have to cut his pocket money if he keeps doing it so he got really angry and chucked his playstation out of the window thats a sort of computer thing you can play games on bit stupid really now he hasnt even got megamutilation part three to take his mind off thingsim okay mainly because the dursleys are terrified you might turn up and turn them all into bats if i ask you toa weird thing happened this morning though my scar hurt again last time that happened it was because voldemort was at hogwarts but i dont reckon he can be anywhere near me now can he do you know if curse scars sometimes hurt years afterwardill send this with hedwig when she gets back shes off hunting at the moment say hello to buckbeak for me harryyes thought harry that looked all right there was no point putting in the dream he didnt want it to look as though he was too worried he folded up the parchment and laid it aside on his desk ready for when hedwig returned then he got to his feet stretched and opened his wardrobe once more without glancing at his reflection he started to get dressed before going down to breakfastchapter three the invitation by the time harry arrived in the kitchen the three dursleys were already seated around the table none of them looked up as he entered or sat down uncle vernons large red face was hidden behind the mornings daily mail and aunt petunia was cutting a grapefruit into quarters her lips pursed over her horselike teethdudley looked furious and sulky and somehow seemed to be taking up even more space than usual this was saying something as he always took up an entire side of the square table by himself when aunt petunia put a quarter of unsweetened grapefruit onto dudleys plate with a tremulous there you are diddy darling dudley glowered at her his life had taken a most unpleasant turn since he had come home for the summer with his endofyear reportuncle vernon and aunt petunia had managed to find excuses for his bad marks as usual aunt petunia always insisted that dudley was a very gifted boy whose teachers didnt understand him while uncle vernon maintained that he didnt want some swotty little nancy boy for a son anyway they also skated over the accusations of bullying in the report hes a boisterous little boy but he wouldnt hurt a fly aunt petunia had said tearfullyhowever at the bottom of the report there were a few wellchosen comments from the school nurse that not even uncle vernon and aunt petunia could explain away no matter how much aunt petunia wailed that dudley was bigboned and that his poundage was really puppy fat and that he was a growing boy who needed plenty of food the fact remained that the school outfitters didnt stock knickerbockers big enough for him anymore the school nurse had seen what aunt petunias eyes so sharp when it came to spotting fingerprints on her gleaming walls and in observing the comings and goings of the neighbors simply refused to see that far from needing extra nourishment dudley had reached roughly the size and weight of a young killer whaleso after many tantrums after arguments that shook harrys bedroom floor and many tears from aunt petunia the new regime had begun the diet sheet that had been sent by the smeltings school nurse had been taped to the fridge which had been emptied of all dudleys favorite things fizzy drinks and cakes chocolate bars and burgers and filled instead with fruit and vegetables and the sorts of things that uncle vernon called rabbit food to make dudley feel better about it all aunt petunia had insisted that the whole family follow the diet too she now passed a grapefruit quarter to harry he noticed that it was a lot smaller than dudleys aunt petunia seemed to feet that the best way to keep up dudleys morale was to make sure that he did at least get more to eat than harrybut aunt petunia didnt know what was hidden under the loose floorboard upstairs she had no idea that harry was not following the diet at all the moment he had got wind of the fact that he was expected to survive the summer on carrot sticks harry had sent hedwig to his friends with pleas for help and they had risen to the occasion magnificently hedwig had returned from hermiones house with a large box stuffed full of sugarfree snacks hermiones parents were dentists hagrid the hogwarts gamekeeper had obliged with a sack full of his own homemade rock cakes harry hadnt touched these he had had too much experience of hagrids cooking mrs weasley however had sent the family owl errol with an enormous fruitcake and assorted meat pies poor errol who was elderly and feeble had needed a full five days to recover from the journey and then on harrys birthday which the dursleys had completely ignored he had received four superb birthday cakes one each from ron hermione hagrid and sirius harry still had two of them left and so looking forward to a real breakfast when he got back upstairs he ate his grapefruit without complaintuncle vernon laid aside his paper with a deep sniff of disapproval and looked down at his own grapefruit quarteris this it he said grumpily to aunt petuniaaunt petunia gave him a severe look and then nodded pointedly at dudley who had already finished his own grapefruit quarter and was eyeing harrys with a very sour look in his piggy little eyesuncle vernon gave a great sigh which ruffled his large bushy mustache and picked up his spoonthe doorbell rang uncle vernon heaved himself out of his chair and set off down the hall quick as a flash while his mother was occupied with the kettle dudley stole the rest of uncle vernons grapefruitharry heard talking at the door and someone laughing and uncle vernon answering curtly then the front door closed and the sound of ripping paper came from the hallaunt petunia set the teapot down on the table and looked curiously around to see where uncle vernon had got to she didnt have to wait long to find out after about a minute he was back he looked lividyou he barked at harry in the living room nowbewildered wondering what on earth he was supposed to have done this time harry got up and followed uncle vernon out of the kitchen and into the next room uncle vernon closed the door sharply behind both of themso he said marching over to the fireplace and turning to face harry as though he were about to pronounce him under arrest soharry would have dearly loved to have said so what but he didnt feel that uncle vernons temper should be tested this early in the morning especially when it was already under severe strain from lack of food he therefore settled for looking politely puzzledthis just arrived said uncle vernon he brandished a piece of purple writing paper at harry a letter about youharrys confusion increased who would be writing to uncle vernon about him who did he know who sent letters by the postmanuncle vernon glared at harry then looked down at the letter and began to read alouddear mr and mrs dursleywe have never been introduced but i am sure you have heard a great deal from harry about my son ronas harry might have told you the final of the quidditch world cup takes place this monday night and my husband arthur has just managed to get prime tickets through his connections at the department of magical games and sportsi do hope you will allow us to take harry to the match as this really is a onceinalifetime opportunity britain hasnt hosted the cup for thirty years and tickets are extremely hard to come by we would of course be glad to have harry stay for the remainder of the summer holidays and to see him safely onto the train back to schoolit would be best for harry to send us your answer as quickly as possible in the normal way because the muggle postman has never delivered to our house and i am not sure he even knows where it ishoping to see harry soonyours sincerelymolly weasleyps i do hope weve put enough stamps onuncle vernon finished reading put his hand back into his breast pocket and drew out something elselook at this he growledhe held up the envelope in which mrs weasleys letter had come and harry had to fight down a laugh every bit of it was covered in stamps except for a square inch on the front into which mrs weasley had squeezed the dursleys address in minute writingshe did put enough stamps on then said harry trying to sound as though mrs weasleys was a mistake anyone could make his uncles eyes flashedthe postman noticed he said through gritted teeth very interested to know where this letter came from he was thats why he rang the doorbell seemed to think it was funnyharry didnt say anything other people might not understand why uncle vernon was making a fuss about too many stamps but harry had lived with the dursleys too long not to know how touchy they were about anything even slightly out of the ordinary their worst fear was that someone would find out that they were connected however distantly with people like mrs weasleyuncle vernon was still glaring at harry who tried to keep his expression neutral if he didnt do or say anything stupid he might just be in for the treat of a lifetime he waited for uncle vernon to say something but he merely continued to glare harry decided to break the silenceso can i go then he askeda slight spasm crossed uncle vernons large purple face the mustache bristled harry thought he knew what was going on behind the mustache a furious battle as two of uncle vernons most fundamental instincts came into conflict allowing harry to go would make harry happy something uncle vernon had struggled against for thirteen years on the other hand allowing harry to disappear to the weasleys for the rest of the summer would get rid of him two weeks earlier than anyone could have hoped and uncle vernon hated having harry in the house to give himself thinking time it seemed he looked down at mrs weasleys letter againwho is this woman he said staring at the signature with distasteyouve seen her said harry shes my friend rons mother she was meeting him off the hog off the school train at the end of last termhe had almost said hogwarts express and that was a sure way to get his uncles temper up nobody ever mentioned the name of harrys school aloud in the dursley householduncle vernon screwed up his enormous face as though trying to remember something very unpleasantdumpy sort of woman he growled finally load of children with red hairharry frowned he thought it was a bit rich of uncle vernon to call anyone dumpy when his own son dudley had finally achieved what hed been threatening to do since the age of three and become wider than he was talluncle vernon was perusing the letter againquidditch he muttered under his breath quidditch what is this rubbishharry felt a second stab of annoyanceits a sport he said shortly played on broom all right all right said uncle vernon loudly harry saw with some satisfaction that his uncle looked vaguely panicky apparently his nerves couldnt stand the sound of the word broomsticks in his living room he took refuge in perusing the letter again harry saw his lips form the words send us your answer in the normal way he scowledwhat does she mean the normal way he spatnormal for us said harry and before his uncle could stop him he added you know owl post thats whats normal for wizardsuncle vernon looked as outraged as if harry had just uttered a disgusting swearword shaking with anger he shot a nervous look through the window as though expecting to see some of the neighbors with their ears pressed against the glasshow many times do i have to tell you not to mention that unnaturalness under my roof he hissed his face now a rich plum color you stand there in the clothes petunia and i have put on your ungrateful back only after dudley finished with them said harry coldly and indeed he was dressed in a sweatshirt so large for him that he had had to roll back the sleeves five times so as to be able to use his hands and which fell past the knees of his extremely baggy jeansi will not be spoken to like that said uncle vernon trembling with ragebut harry wasnt going to stand for this gone were the days when he had been forced to take every single one of the dursleys stupid rules he wasnt following dudleys diet and he wasnt going to let uncle vernon stop him from going to the quidditch world cup not if he could help it harry took a deep steadying breath and then said okay i cant see the world cup can i go now then only ive got a letter to sirius i want to finish you know my godfatherhe had done it he had said the magic words now he watched the purple recede blotchily from uncle vernons face making it look like badly mixed black currant ice creamyoure youre writing to him are you said uncle vernon in a wouldbe calm voice but harry had seen the pupils of his tiny eyes contract with sudden fearwell yeah said harry casually its been a while since he heard from me and you know if he doesnt he might start thinking somethings wronghe stopped there to enjoy the effect of these words he could almost see the cogs working under uncle vernons thick dark neatly parted hair if he tried to stop harry writing to sirius sirius would think harry was being mistreated if he told harry he couldnt go to the quidditch world cup harry would write and tell sirius who would know harry was being mistreated there was only one thing for uncle vernon to do harry could see the conclusion forming in his uncles mind as though the great mustached face were transparent harry tried not to smile to keep his own face as blank as possible and then well all right then you can go to this ruddy this stupid this world cup thing you write and tell these these weasleys theyre to pick you up mind i havent got time to go dropping you off all over the country and you can spend the rest of the summer there and you can tell your your godfather tell him tell him youre goingokay then said harry brightlyhe turned and walked toward the living room door fighting the urge to jump into the air and whoop he was going he was going to the weasleys he was going to watch the quidditch world cupoutside in the hall he nearly ran into dudley who had been lurking behind the door clearly hoping to overhear harry being told off he looked shocked to see the broad grin on harrys facethat was an excellent breakfast wasnt it said harry i feel really full dont youlaughing at the astonished look on dudleys face harry took the stairs three at a time and hurled himself back into his bedroomthe first thing he saw was that hedwig was back she was sitting in her cage staring at harry with her enormous amber eyes and clicking her beak in the way that meant she was annoyed about something exactly what was annoying her became apparent almost at onceouch said harry as what appeared to be a small gray feathery tennis ball collided with the side of his head harry massaged the spot furiously looking up to see what had hit him and saw a minute owl small enough to fit into the palm of his hand whizzing excitedly around the room like a loose firework harry then realized that the owl had dropped a letter at his feet harry bent down recognized rons handwriting then tore open the envelope inside was a hastily scribbled noteharry dad got the tickets ireland versus bulgaria monday night mums writing to the muggles to ask you to stay they might already have the letter i dont know how fast muggle post is thought id send this with pig anywayharry stared at the word pig then looked up at the tiny owl now zooming around the light fixture on the ceiling he had never seen anything that looked less like a pig maybe he couldnt read rons writing he went back to the letterwere coming for you whether the muggles like it or not you cant miss the world cup only mum and dad reckon its better if we pretend to ask their permission first if they say yes send pig back with your answer pronto and well come and get you at five oclock on sunday if they say no send pig back pronto and well come and get you at five oclock on sunday anywayhermiones arriving this afternoon percys started work the department of international magical cooperation dont mention anything about abroad while youre here unless you want the pants bored off yousee you soon roncalm down harry said as the small owl flew low over his head twittering madly with what harry could only assume was pride at having delivered the letter to the right person come here i need you to take my answer backthe owl fluttered down on top of hedwigs cage hedwig looked coldly up at it as though daring it to try and come any closerharry seized his eaglefeather quill once more grabbed a fresh piece of parchment and wroteron its all okay the muggles say i can come see you five oclock tomorrow cant wait harryhe folded this note up very small and with immense difficulty tied it to the tiny owls leg as it hopped on the spot with excitement the moment the note was secure the owl was off again it zoomed out of the window and out of sightharry turned to hedwigfeeling up to a long journey he asked herhedwig hooted in a dignified sort of a waycan you take this to sirius for me he said picking up his letter hang on i just want to finish ithe unfolded the parchment and hastily added a postscriptif you want to contact me ill be at my friend ron weasleys for the rest of the summer his dads got us tickets for the quidditch world cupthe letter finished he tied it to hedwigs leg she kept unusually still as though determined to show him how a real post owl should behaveill be at rons when you get back all right harry told hershe nipped his finger affectionately then with a soft swooshing noise spread her enormous wings and soared out of the open windowharry watched her out of sight then crawled under his bed wrenched up the loose floorboard and pulled out a large chunk of birthday cake he sat there on the floor eating it savoring the happiness that was flooding through him he had cake and dudley had nothing but grapefruit it was a bright summers day he would be leaving privet drive tomorrow his scar felt perfectly normal again and he was going to watch the quidditch world cup it was hard just now to feel worried about anything even lord voldemortchapter four back to the burrowby twelve oclock the next day harrys school trunk was packed with his school things and all his most prized possessions the invisibility cloak he had inherited from his father the broomstick he had gotten from sirius the enchanted map of hogwarts he had been given by fred and george weasley last year he had emptied his hiding place under the loose floorboard of all food doublechecked every nook and cranny of his bedroom for forgotten spellbooks or quills and taken down the chart on the wall counting down the days to september the first on which he liked to cross off the days remaining until his return to hogwartsthe atmosphere inside number four privet drive was extremely tense the imminent arrival at their house of an assortment of wizards was making the dursleys uptight and irritable uncle vernon had looked downright alarmed when harry informed him that the weasleys would be arriving at five oclock the very next dayi hope you told them to dress properly these people he snarled at once ive seen the sort of stuff your lot wear theyd better have the decency to put on normal clothes thats allharry felt a slight sense of foreboding he had rarely seen mr or mrs weasley wearing anything that the dursleys would call normal their children might don muggle clothing during the holidays but mr and mrs weasley usually wore long robes in varying states of shabbiness harry wasnt bothered about what the neighbors would think but he was anxious about how rude the dursleys might be to the weasleys if they turned up looking like their worst idea of wizardsuncle vernon had put on his best suit to some people this might have looked like a gesture of welcome but harry knew it was because uncle vernon wanted to look impressive and intimidating dudley on the other hand looked somehow diminished this was not because the diet was at last taking effect but due to fright dudley had emerged from his last encounter with a fully grown wizard with a curly pigs tail poking out of the seat of his trousers and aunt petunia and uncle vernon had had to pay for its removal at a private hospital in london it wasnt altogether surprising therefore that dudley kept running his hand nervously over his backside and walking sideways from room to room so as not to present the same target to the enemylunch was an almost silent meal dudley didnt even protest at the food cottage cheese and grated celery aunt petunia wasnt eating anything at all her arms were folded her lips were pursed and she seemed to be chewing her tongue as though biting back the furious diatribe she longed to throw at harrytheyll be driving of course uncle vernon barked across the tableer said harryhe hadnt thought of that how were the weasleys going to pick him up they didnt have a car anymore the old ford anglia they had once owned was currently running wild in the forbidden forest at hogwarts but mr weasley had borrowed a ministry of magic car last year possibly he would do the same todayi think so said harryuncle vernon snorted into his mustache normally uncle vernon would have asked what car mr weasley drove he tended to judge other men by how big and expensive their cars were but harry doubted whether uncle vernon would have taken to mr weasley even if he drove a ferrariharry spent most of the afternoon in his bedroom he couldnt stand watching aunt petunia peer out through the net curtains every few seconds as though there had been a warning about an escaped rhinoceros finally at a quarter to five harry went back downstairs and into the living roomaunt petunia was compulsively straightening cushions uncle vernon was pretending to read the paper but his tiny eyes were not moving and harry was sure he was really listening with all his might for the sound of an approaching car dudley was crammed into an armchair his porky hands beneath him clamped firmly around his bottom harry couldnt take the tension he left the room and went and sat on the stairs in the hall his eyes on his watch and his heart pumping fast from excitement and nervesbut five oclock came and then went uncle vernon perspiring slightly in his suit opened the front door peered up and down the street then withdrew his head quicklytheyre late he snarled at harryi know said harry maybe er the traffics bad or somethingten past five then a quarter past five harry was starting to feel anxious himself now at half past he heard uncle vernon and aunt petunia conversing in terse mutters in the living roomno consideration at allwe mightve had an engagementmaybe they think theyll get invited to dinner if theyre latewell they most certainly wont be said uncle vernon and harry heard him stand up and start pacing the living room theyll take the boy and go therell be no hanging around thats if theyre coming at all probably mistaken the day i daresay their kind dont set much store by punctuality either that or they drive some tinpot car thats broken d aaaaaaaarrrrrghharry jumped up from the other side of the living room door came the sounds of the three dursleys scrambling panicstricken across the room next moment dudley came flying into the hall looking terrifiedwhat happened said harry whats the matterbut dudley didnt seem able to speak hands still clamped over his buttocks he waddled as fast as he could into the kitchen harry hurried into the living roomloud bangings and scrapings were coming from behind the dursleys boardedup fireplace which had a fake coal fire plugged in front of itwhat is it gasped aunt petunia who had backed into the wall and was staring terrified toward the fire what is it vernonbut they were left in doubt barely a second longer voices could be heard from inside the blocked fireplaceouch fred no go back go back theres been some kind of mistake tell george not to ouch george no theres no room go back quickly and tell ronmaybe harry can hear us dad maybe hell be able to let us outthere was a loud hammering of fists on the boards behind the electric fireharry harry can you hear usthe dursleys rounded on harry like a pair of angry wolverineswhat is this growled uncle vernon whats going onthey theyve tried to get here by floo powder said harry fighting a mad desire to laugh they can travel by fire only youve blocked the fireplace hang on he approached the fireplace and called through the boardsmr weasley can you hear methe hammering stopped somebody inside the chimney piece said shhmr weasley its harry the fireplace has been blocked up you wont be able to get through theredamn said mr weasleys voice what on earth did they want to block up the fireplace fortheyve got an electric fire harry explainedreally said mr weasleys voice excitedly eclectic you say with a plug gracious i must see that lets think ouch ronrons voice now joined the otherswhat are we doing here has something gone wrongoh no ron came freds voice very sarcastically no this is exactly where we wanted to end upyeah were having the time of our lives here said george whose voice sounded muffled as though he was squashed against the wallboys boys said mr weasley vaguely im trying to think what to do yes only way stand back harryharry retreated to the sofa uncle vernon however moved forwardwait a moment he bellowed at the fire what exactly are you going to bangthe electric fire shot across the room as the boardedup fireplace burst outward expelling mr weasley fred george and ron in a cloud of rubble and loose chippings aunt petunia shrieked and fell backward over the coffee table uncle vernon caught her before she hit the floor and gaped speechless at the weasleys all of whom had bright red hair including fred and george who were identical to the last frecklethats better panted mr weasley brushing dust from his long green robes and straightening his glasses ah you must be harrys aunt and uncletall thin and balding he moved toward uncle vernon his hand outstretched but uncle vernon backed away several paces dragging aunt petunia words utterly failed uncle vernon his best suit was covered in white dust which had settled in his hair and mustache and made him look as though he had just aged thirty yearser yes sorry about that said mr weasley lowering his hand and looking over his shoulder at the blasted fireplace its all my fault it just didnt occur to me that we wouldnt be able to get out at the other end i had your fireplace connected to the floo network you see just for an afternoon you know so we could get harry muggle fireplaces arent supposed to be connected strictly speaking but ive got a useful contact at the floo regulation panel and he fixed it for me i can put it right in a jiffy though dont worry ill light a fire to send the boys back and then i can repair your fireplace before i disapparateharry was ready to bet that the dursleys hadnt understood a single word of this they were still gaping at mr weasley thunderstruck aunt petunia staggered upright again and hid behind uncle vernonhello harry said mr weasley brightly got your trunk readyits upstairs said harry grinning backwell get it said fred at once winking at harry he and george left the room they knew where harrys bedroom was having once rescued him from it in the dead of night harry suspected that fred and george were hoping for a glimpse of dudley they had heard a lot about him from harrywell said mr weasley swinging his arms slightly while he tried to find words to break the very nasty silence very erm very nice place youve got hereas the usually spotless living room was now covered in dust and bits of brick this remark didnt go down too well with the dursleys uncle vernons face purpled once more and aunt petunia started chewing her tongue again however they seemed too scared to actually say anythingmr weasley was looking around he loved everything to do with muggles harry could see him itching to go and examine the television and the video recorderthey run off eckeltricity do they he said knowledgeably ah yes i can see the plugs i collect plugs he added to uncle vernon and batteries got a very large collection of batteries my wife thinks im mad but there you areuncle vernon clearly thought mr weasley was mad too he moved ever so slightly to the right screening aunt petunia from view as though he thought mr weasley might suddenly run at them and attackdudley suddenly reappeared in the room harry could hear the clunk of his trunk on the stairs and knew that the sounds had scared dudley out of the kitchen dudley edged along the wall gazing at mr weasley with terrified eyes and attempted to conceal himself behind his mother and father unfortunately uncle vernons bulk while sufficient to hide bony aunt petunia was nowhere near enough to conceal dudleyah this is your cousin is it harry said mr weasley taking another brave stab at making conversationyep said harry thats dudleyhe and ron exchanged glances and then quickly looked away from each other the temptation to burst out laughing was almost overwhelming dudley was still clutching his bottom as though afraid it might fall off mr weasley however seemed genuinely concerned at dudleys peculiar behavior indeed from the tone of his voice when he next spoke harry was quite sure that mr weasley thought dudley was quite as mad as the dursleys thought he was except that mr weasley felt sympathy rather than fearhaving a good holiday dudley he said kindlydudley whimpered harry saw his hands tighten still harder over his massive backsidefred and george came back into the room carrying harrys school trunk they glanced around as they entered and spotted dudley their faces cracked into identical evil grinsah right said mr weasley better get cracking thenhe pushed up the sleeves of his robes and took out his wand harry saw the dursleys draw back against the wall as oneincendio said mr weasley pointing his wand at the hole in the wall behind himflames rose at once in the fireplace crackling merrily as though they had been burning for hours mr weasley took a small drawstring bag from his pocket untied it took a pinch of the powder inside and threw it onto the flames which turned emerald green and roared higher than everoff you go then fred said mr weasleycoming said fred oh no hang on a bag of sweets had spilled out of freds pocket and the contents were now rolling in every direction big fat toffees in brightly colored wrappersfred scrambled around cramming them back into his pocket then gave the dursleys a cheery wave stepped forward and walked right into the fire saying the burrow aunt petunia gave a little shuddering gasp there was a whooshing sound and fred vanishedright then george said mr weasley you and the trunkharry helped george carry the trunk forward into the flames and turn it onto its end so that he could hold it better then with a second whoosh george had cried the burrow and vanished tooron you next said mr weasleysee you said ron brightly to the dursleys he grinned broadly at harry then stepped into the fire shouted the burrow and disappearednow harry and mr weasley alone remainedwell bye then harry said to the dursleysthey didnt say anything at all harry moved toward the fire but just as he reached the edge of the hearth mr weasley put out a hand and held him back he was looking at the dursleys in amazementharry said goodbye to you he said didnt you hear himit doesnt matter harry muttered to mr weasley honestly i dont caremr weasley did not remove his hand from harrys shoulderyou arent going to see your nephew till next summer he said to uncle vernon in mild indignation surely youre going to say goodbyeuncle vernons face worked furiously the idea of being taught consideration by a man who had just blasted away half his living room wall seemed to be causing him intense suffering but mr weasleys wand was still in his hand and uncle vernons tiny eyes darted to it once before he said very resentfully goodbye thensee you said harry putting one foot forward into the green flames which felt pleasantly like warm breath at that moment however a horrible gagging sound erupted behind him and aunt petunia started to screamharry wheeled around dudley was no longer standing behind his parents he was kneeling beside the coffee table and he was gagging and sputtering on a footlong purple slimy thing that was protruding from his mouth one bewildered second later harry realized that the footlong thing was dudleys tongue and that a brightly colored toffee wrapper lay on the floor before himaunt petunia hurled herself onto the ground beside dudley seized the end of his swollen tongue and attempted to wrench it out of his mouth unsurprisingly dudley yelled and sputtered worse than ever trying to fight her off uncle vernon was bellowing and waving his arms around and mr weasley had to shout to make himself heardnot to worry i can sort him out he yelled advancing on dudley with his wand outstretched but aunt petunia screamed worse than ever and threw herself on top of dudley shielding him from mr weasleyno really said mr weasley desperately its a simple process it was the toffee my son fred real practical joker but its only an engorgement charm at least i think it is please i can correct it but far from being reassured the dursleys became more panic stricken aunt petunia was sobbing hysterically tugging dudleys tongue as though determined to rip it out dudley appeared to be suffocating under the combined pressure of his mother and his tongue and uncle vernon who had lost control completely seized a china figure from on top of the sideboard and threw it very hard at mr weasley who ducked causing the ornament to shatter in the blasted fireplacenow really said mr weasley angrily brandishing his wand im trying to helpbellowing like a wounded hippo uncle vernon snatched up another ornamentharry go just go mr weasley shouted his wand on uncle vernon ill sort this outharry didnt want to miss the fun but uncle vernons second ornament narrowly missed his left ear and on balance he thought it best to leave the situation to mr weasley he stepped into the fire looking over his shoulder as he said the burrow his last fleeting glimpse of the living room was of mr weasley blasting a third ornament out of uncle vernons hand with his wand aunt petunia screaming and lying on top of dudley and dudleys tongue lolling around like a great slimy python but next moment harry had begun to spin very fast and the dursleys living room was whipped out of sight in a rush of emeraldgreen flameschapter five weasleys wizard wheezesharry spun faster and faster elbows tucked tightly to his sides blurred fireplaces flashing past him until he started to feel sick and closed his eyes then when at last he felt himself slowing down he threw out his hands and came to a halt in time to prevent himself from falling face forward out of the weasleys kitchen firedid he eat it said fred excitedly holding out a hand to pull harry to his feeyeah said harry straightening up what was ittontongue toffee said fred brightly george and i invented them and weve been looking for someone to test them on all summer the tiny kitchen exploded with laughter harry looked around and saw that ron and george were sitting at the scrubbed wooden table with two redhaired people harry had never seen before though he knew immediately who they must be bill and charlie the two eldest weasley brothershowre you doing harry said the nearer of the two grinning at him and holding out a large hand which harry shook feeling calluses and blisters under his fingers this had to be charlie who worked with dragons in romania charlie was built like the twins shorter and stockier than percy and ron who were both long and lanky he had a broad goodnatured face which was weatherbeaten and so freckly that he looked almost tanned his arms were muscular and one of them had a large shiny burn on itbill got to his feet smiling and also shook harrys hand bill came as something of a surprise harry knew that he worked for the wizarding bank gringotts and that bill had been head boy at hogwarts harry had always imagined bill to be an older version of percy fussy about rulebreaking and fond of bossing everyone around however bill was there was no other word for it cool he was tall with long hair that he had tied back in a ponytail he was wearing an earring with what looked like a fang dangling from it bills clothes would not have looked out of place at a rock concert except that harry recognized his boots to be made not of leather but of dragon hidebefore any of them could say anything else there was a faint popping noise and mr weasley appeared out of thin air at georges shoulder he was looking angrier than harry had ever seen himthat wasnt funny fred he shouted what on earth did you give that muggle boyi didnt give him anything said fred with another evil grin i just dropped it it was his fault he went and ate it i never told him toyou dropped it on purpose roared mr weasley you knew hed eat it you knew he was on a diet how big did his tongue get george asked eagerlyit was four feet long before his parents would let me shrink itharry and the weasleys roared with laughter againit isnt funny mr weasley shouted that sort of behavior seriously undermines wizardmuggle relations i spend half my life campaigning against the mistreatment of muggles and my own sonswe didnt give it to him because hes a muggle said fred indignantlyno we gave it to him because hes a great bullying git said george isnt he harryyeah he is mr weasley said harry earnestlythats not the point raged mr weasley you wait until i tell your mother tell me what said a voice behind themmrs weasley had just entered the kitchen she was a short plump woman with a very kind face though her eyes were presently narrowed with suspicionoh hello harry dear she said spotting him and smiling then her eyes snapped back to her husband tell me what arthurmr weasley hesitated harry could tell that however angry he was with fred and george he hadnt really intended to tell mrs weasley what had happened there was a silence while mr weasley eyed his wife nervously then two girls appeared in the kitchen doorway behind mrs weasley one with very bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth was harrys and rons friend hermione granger the other who was small and redhaired was rons younger sister ginny both of them smiled at harry who grinned back which made ginny go scarlet she had been very taken with harry ever since his first visit to the burrowtell me what arthur mrs weasley repeated in a dangerous sort of voiceits nothing molly mumbled mr weasley fred and george just but ive had words with them what have they done this time said mrs weasley if its got anything to do with weasleys wizard wheezes why dont you show harry where hes sleeping ron said hermione from the doorwayhe knows where hes sleeping said ron in my room he slept there last we can all go said hermione pointedlyoh said ron cottoning on rightyeah well come too said georgeyou stay where you are snarled mrs weasleyharry and ron edged out of the kitchen and they hermione and ginny set off along the narrow hallway and up the rickety staircase that zigzagged through the house to the upper storieswhat are weasleys wizard wheezes harry asked as they climbedron and ginny both laughed although hermione didntmum found this stack of order forms when she was cleaning fred and georges room said ron quietly great long price lists for stuff theyve invented joke stuff you know fake wands and trick sweets loads of stuff it was brilliant i never knew theyd been inventing all that weve been hearing explosions out of their room for ages but we never thought they were actually making things said ginny we thought they just liked the noiseonly most of the stuff well all of it really was a bit dangerous said ron and you know they were planning to sell it at hogwarts to make some money and mum went mad at them told them they werent allowed to make any more of it and burned all the order forms shes furious at them anyway they didnt get as many owls as she expectedowls were ordinary wizarding levels the examinations hogwarts students took at the age of fifteenand then there was this big row ginny said because mum wants them to go into the ministry of magic like dad and they told her all they want to do is open a joke shopjust then a door on the second landing opened and a face poked out wearing hornrimmed glasses and a very annoyed expressionhi percy said harryoh hello harry said percy i was wondering who was making all the noise im trying to work in here you know ive got a report to finish for the office and its rather difficult to concentrate when people keep thundering up and down the stairswere not thundering said ron irritably were walking sorry if weve disturbed the topsecret workings of the ministry of magicwhat are you working on said harrya report for the department of international magical cooperation said percy smugly were trying to standardize cauldron thickness some of these foreign imports are just a shade too thin leakages have been increasing at a rate of almost three percent a year thatll change the world that report will said ron front page of the daily prophet i expect cauldron leakspercy went slightly pinkyou might sneer ron he said heatedly but unless some sort of international law is imposed we might well find the market flooded with flimsy shallowbottomed products that seriously endanger yeah yeah all right said ron and he started off upstairs again percy slammed his bedroom door shut as harry hermione and ginny followed ron up three more flights of stairs shouts from the kitchen below echoed up to them it sounded as though mr weasley had told mrs weasley about the toffeesthe room at the top of the house where ron slept looked much as it had the last time that harry had come to stay the same posters of rons favorite quidditch team the chudley cannons were whirling and waving on the walls and sloping ceiling and the fish tank on the windowsill which had previously held frog spawn now contained one extremely large frog rons old rat scabbers was here no more but instead there was the tiny gray owl that had delivered rons letter to harry in privet drive it was hopping up and down in a small cage and twittering madlyshut up pig said ron edging his way between two of the four beds that had been squeezed into the room fred and george are in here with us because bill and charlie are in their room he told harry percy gets to keep his room all to himself because hes got to worker why are you calling that owl pig harry asked ronbecause hes being stupid said ginny its proper name is pigwidgeonyeah and thats not a stupid name at all said ron sarcastically ginny named him he explained to harry she reckons its sweet and i tried to change it but it was too late he wont answer to anything else so now hes pig ive got to keep him up here because he annoys errol and hermes he annoys me too come to thatpigwidgeon zoomed happily around his cage hooting shrilly harry knew ron too well to take him seriously he had moaned continually about his old rat scabbers but had been most upset when hermiones cat crookshanks appeared to have eaten himwheres crookshanks harry asked hermione nowout in the garden i expect she said he likes chasing gnomes hes never seen any beforepercys enjoying work then said harry sitting down on one of the beds and watching the chudley cannons zooming in and out of the posters on the ceilingenjoying it said ron darkly i dont reckon hed come home if dad didnt make him hes obsessed just dont get him onto the subject of his boss according to mr crouch as i was saying to mr crouch mr crouch is of the opinion mr crouch was telling me theyll be announcing their engagement any day nowhave you had a good summer harry said hermione did you get our food parcels and everythingyeah thanks a lot said harry they saved my life those cakesand have you heard from ron began but at a look from hermione he fell silent harry knew ron had been about to ask about sirius ron and hermione had been so deeply involved in helping sirius escape from the ministry of magic that they were almost as concerned about harrys godfather as he was however discussing him in front of ginny was a bad idea nobody but themselves and professor dumbledore knew about how sirius had escaped or believed in his innocencei think theyve stopped arguing said hermione to cover the awkward moment because ginny was looking curiously from ron to harry shall we go down and help your mum with dinneryeah all right said ron the four of them left rons room and went back downstairs to find mrs weasley alone in the kitchen looking extremely badtemperedwere eating out in the garden she said when they came in theres just not room for eleven people in here could you take the plates outside girls bill and charlie are setting up the tables knives and forks please you two she said to ron and harry pointing her wand a little more vigorously than she had intended at a pile of potatoes in the sink which shot out of their skins so fast that they ricocheted off the walls and ceilingoh for heavens sake she snapped now directing her wand at a dustpan which hopped off the sideboard and started skating across the floor scooping up the potatoes those two she burst out savagely now pulling pots and pans out of a cupboard and harry knew she meant fred and george i dont know whats going to happen to them i really dont no ambition unless you count making as much trouble as they possibly canmrs weasley slammed a large copper saucepan down on the kitchen table and began to wave her wand around inside it a creamy sauce poured from the wand tip as she stirredits not as though they havent got brains she continued irritably taking the saucepan over to the stove and lighting it with a further poke of her wand but theyre wasting them and unless they pull themselves together soon theyll be in real trouble ive had more owls from hogwarts about them than the rest put together if they carry on the way theyre going theyll end up in front of the improper use of magic officemrs weasley jabbed her wand at the cutlery drawer which shot open harry and ron both jumped out of the way as several knives soared out of it flew across the kitchen and began chopping the potatoes which had just been tipped back into the sink by the dustpani dont know where we went wrong with them said mrs weasley putting down her wand and starting to pull out still more saucepans its been the same for years one thing after another and they wont listen to oh not againshe had picked up her wand from the table and it had emitted a loud squeak and turned into a giant rubber mouseone of their fake wands again she shouted how many times have i told them not to leave them lying aroundshe grabbed her real wand and turned around to find that the sauce on the stove was smokingcmon ron said hurriedly to harry seizing a handful of cutlery from the open drawer lets go and help bill and charliethey left mrs weasley and headed out the back door into the yardthey had only gone a few paces when hermiones bandylegged ginger cat crookshanks came pelting out of the garden bottlebrush tail held high in the air chasing what looked like a muddy potato on legs harry recognized it instantly as a gnome barely ten inches high its horny little feet pattered very fast as it sprinted across the yard and dived headlong into one of the wellington boots that lay scattered around the door harry could hear the gnome giggling madly as crookshanks inserted a paw into the boot trying to reach it meanwhile a very loud crashing noise was coming from the other side of the house the source of the commotion was revealed as they entered the garden and saw that bill and charlie both had their wands out and were making two battered old tables fly high above the lawn smashing into each other each attempting to knock the others out of the air fred and george were cheering ginny was laughing and hermione was hovering near the hedge apparently torn between amusement and anxietybills table caught charlies with a huge bang and knocked one of its legs off there was a clatter from overhead and they all looked up to see percys head poking out of a window on the second floorwill you keep it down he bellowedsorry perce said bill grinning howre the cauldron bottoms coming onvery badly said percy peevishly and he slammed the window shut chuckling bill and charlie directed the tables safely onto the grass end to end and then with a flick of his wand bill reattached the table leg and conjured tablecloths from nowhereby seven oclock the two tables were groaning under dishes and dishes of mrs weasleys excellent cooking and the nine weasleys harry and hermione were settling themselves down to eat beneath a clear deepblue sky to somebody who had been living on meals of increasingly stale cake all summer this was paradise and at first harry listened rather than talked as he helped himself to chicken and ham pie boiled potatoes and saladat the far end of the table percy was telling his father all about his report on cauldron bottomsive told mr crouch that ill have it ready by tuesday percy was saying pompously thats a bit sooner than he expected it but i like to keep on top of things i think hell be grateful ive done it in good time i mean its extremely busy in our department just now what with all the arrangements for the world cup were just not getting the support we need from the department of magical games and sports ludo bagman i like ludo said mr weasley mildly he was the one who got us such good tickets for the cup i did him a bit of a favor his brother otto got into a spot of trouble a lawnmower with unnatural powers i smoothed the whole thing overoh bagmans likable enough of course said percy dismissively but how he ever got to be head of department when i compare him to mr crouch i cant see mr crouch losing a member of our department and not trying to find out whats happened to them you realize bertha jorkins has been missing for over a month now went on holiday to albania and never came backyes i was asking ludo about that said mr weasley frowning he says berthas gotten lost plenty of times before now though must say if it was someone in my department id be worried oh berthas hopeless all right said percy i hear shes been shunted from department to department for years much more trouble than shes worth but all the same bagman ought to be trying to find her mr crouch has been taking a personal interest she worked in our department at one time you know and i think mr crouch was quite fond of her but bagman just keeps laughing and saying she probably misread the map and ended up in australia instead of albania however percy heaved an impressive sigh and took a deep swig of elderflower wine weve got quite enough on our plates at the department of international magical cooperation without trying to find members of other departments too as you know weve got another big event to organize right after the world cuppercy cleared his throat significantly and looked down toward the end of the table where harry ron and hermione were sitting you know the one im talking about father he raised his voice slightly the topsecret oneron rolled his eyes and muttered to harry and hermione hes been trying to get us to ask what that event is ever since he started work probably an exhibition of thickbottomed cauldronsin the middle of the table mrs weasley was arguing with bill about his earring which seemed to be a recent acquisitionwith a horrible great fang on it really bill what do they say at the bankmumno one at the bank gives a damn how i dress as long as i bring home plenty of treasure said bill patientlyand your hairs getting silly dear said mrs weasley fingering her wand lovingly i wish youd let me give it a trim i like it said ginny who was sitting beside bill youre so oldfashioned mum anyway its nowhere near as long as professor dumbledoresnext to mrs weasley fred george and charlie were all talking spiritedly about the world cupits got to be ireland said charlie thickly through a mouthful of potato they flattened peru in the semifinalsbulgaria has got viktor krum though said fredkrums one decent player ireland has got seven said charlie shortly i wish england had got through that was embarrassing that waswhat happened said harry eagerly regretting more than ever his isolation from the wizarding world when he was stuck on privet drivewent down to transylvania three hundred and ninety to ten said charlie gloomily shocking performance and wales lost to uganda and scotland was slaughtered by luxembourgharry had been on the gryffindor house quidditch team ever since his first year at hogwarts and owned one of the best racing brooms in the world a firebolt flying came more naturally to harry than anything else in the magical world and he played in the position of seeker on the gryffindor house teammr weasley conjured up candles to light the darkening garden before they had their homemade strawberry ice cream and by the time they had finished moths were fluttering low over the table and the warm air was perfumed with the smells of grass and honeysuckle harry was feeling extremely well fed and at peace with the world as he watched several gnomes sprinting through the rosebushes laughing madly and closely pursued by crookshanksron looked carefully up the table to check that the rest of the family were all busy talking then he said very quietly to harry so have you heard from sirius latelyhermione looked around listening closelyyeah said harry softly twice he sounds okay i wrote to him yesterday he might write back while im herehe suddenly remembered the reason he had written to sirius and for a moment was on the verge of telling ron and hermione about his scar hurting again and about the dream that had awoken him but he really didnt want to worry them just now not when he himself was feeling so happy and peacefullook at the time mrs weasley said suddenly checking her wristwatch you really should be in bed the whole lot of you youll be up at the crack of dawn to get to the cup harry if you leave your school list out ill get your things for you tomorrow in diagon alley im getting everyone elses there might not be time after the world cup the match went on for five days last timewow hope it does this time said harry enthusiasticallywell i certainly dont said percy sanctimoniously i shudder to think what the state of my intray would be if i was away from work for five daysyeah someone might slip dragon dung in it again eh perce said fredthat was a sample of fertilizer from norway said percy going very red in the face it was nothing personalit was fred whispered to harry as they got up from the table we sent itchapter six the portkeyharry felt as though he had barely lain down to steep in rons room when he was being shaken awake by mrs weasleytime to go harry dear she whispered moving away to wake ronharry felt around for his glasses put them on and sat up it was still dark outside ron muttered indistinctly as his mother roused him at the foot of harrys mattress he saw two large disheveled shapes emerging from tangles of blanketss time already said fred groggilythey dressed in silence too sleepy to talk then yawning and stretching the four of them headed downstairs into the kitchenmrs weasley was stirring the contents of a large pot on the stove while mr weasley was sitting at the table checking a sheaf of large parchment tickets he looked up as the boys entered and spread his arms so that they could see his clothes more clearly he was wearing what appeared to be a golfing sweater and a very old pair of jeans slightly too big for him and held up with a thick leather beltwhat dyou think he asked anxiously were supposed to go incognito do i look like a muggle harryyeah said harry smiling very goodwherere bill and charlie and perperpercy said george failing to stifle a huge yawnwell theyre apparating arent they said mrs weasley heaving the large pot over to the table and starting to ladle porridge into bowls so they can have a bit of a lieinharry knew that apparating meant disappearing from one place and reappearing almost instantly in another but had never known any hogwarts student to do it and understood that it was very difficultso theyre still in bed said fred grumpily pulling his bowl of porridge toward him why cant we apparate toobecause youre not of age and you havent passed your test snapped mrs weasley and where have those girls got toshe bustled out of the kitchen and they heard her climbing the stairsyou have to pass a test to apparate harry askedoh yes said mr weasley tucking the tickets safely into the back pocket of his jeans the department of magical transportation had to fine a couple of people the other day for apparating without a license its not easy apparition and when its not done property it can lead to nasty complications this pair im talking about went and splinched themselveseveryone around the table except harry winceder splinched said harrythey left half of themselves behind said mr weasley now spooning large amounts of treacle onto his porridge so of course they were stuck couldnt move either way had to wait for the accidental magic reversal squad to sort them out meant a fair old bit of paperwork i can tell you what with the muggles who spotted the body parts theyd left behindharry had a sudden vision of a pair of legs and an eyeball lying abandoned on the pavement of privet drivewere they okay he asked startledoh yes said mr weasley matteroffactly but they got a heavy fine and i dont think theyll be trying it again in a hurry you dont mess around with apparition there are plenty of adult wizards who dont bother with it prefer brooms slower but saferbut bill and charlie and percy can all do itcharlie had to take the test twice said fred grinning he failed the first time apparated five miles south of where he meant to right on top of some poor old dear doing her shopping rememberyes well he passed the second time said mrs weasley marching back into the kitchen amid hearty sniggerspercy only passed two weeks ago said george hes been apparating downstairs every morning since just to prove he canthere were footsteps down the passageway and hermione and ginny came into the kitchen both looking pale and drowsywhy do we have to be up so early ginny said rubbing her eyes and sitting down at the tableweve got a bit of a walk said mr weasleywalk said harry what are we walking to the world cup no no thats miles away said mr weasley smiling we only need to walk a short way its just that its very difficult for a large number of wizards to congregate without attracting muggle attention we have to be very careful about how we travel at the best of times and on a huge occasion like the quidditch world cupgeorge said mrs weasley sharply and they all jumpedwhat said george in an innocent tone that deceived nobodywhat is that in your pocketnothingdont you lie to memrs weasley pointed her wand at georges pocket and said accioseveral small brightly colored objects zoomed out of georges pocket he made a grab for them but missed and they sped right into mrs weasleys outstretched handwe told you to destroy them said mrs weasley furiously holding up what were unmistakably more tontongue toffees we told you to get rid of the lot empty your pockets go on both of youit was an unpleasant scene the twins had evidently been trying to smuggle as many toffees out of the house as possible and it was only by using her summoning charm that mrs weasley managed to find them allaccio accio accio she shouted and toffees zoomed from all sorts of unlikely places including the lining of georges jacket and the turnups of freds jeanswe spent six months developing those fred shouted at his mother as she threw the toffees awayoh a fine way to spend six months she shrieked no wonder you didnt get more owlsall in all the atmosphere was not very friendly as they took their departure mrs weasley was still glowering as she kissed mr weasley on the cheek though not nearly as much as the twins who had each hoisted their rucksacks onto their backs and walked out without a word to herwell have a lovely time said mrs weasley and behave yourselves she called after the twins retreating backs but they did not look back or answer ill send bill charlie and percy along around midday mrs weasley said to mr weasley as he harry ron hermione and ginny set off across the dark yard after fred and georgeit was chilly and the moon was still out only a dull greenish tinge along the horizon to their right showed that daybreak was drawing closer harry having been thinking about thousands of wizards speeding toward the quidditch world cup sped up to walk with mr weasleyso how does everyone get there without all the muggles noticing he askedits been a massive organizational problem sighed mr weasley the trouble is about a hundred thousand wizards turn up at the world cup and of course we just havent got a magical site big enough to accommodate them all there are places muggles cant penetrate but imagine trying to pack a hundred thousand wizards into diagon alley or platform nine and threequarters so we had to find a nice deserted moor and set up as many antimuggle precautions as possible the whole ministrys been working on it for months first of course we have to stagger the arrivals people with cheaper tickets have to arrive two weeks beforehand a limited number use muggle transport but we cant have too many clogging up their buses and trains remember wizards are coming from all over the world some apparate of course but we have to set up safe points for them to appear well away from muggles i believe theres a handy wood theyre using as the apparition point for those who dont want to apparate or cant we use portkeys theyre objects that are used to transport wizards from one spot to another at a prearranged time you can do large groups at a time if you need to there have been two hundred portkeys placed at strategic points around britain and the nearest one to us is up at the top of stoatshead hill so thats where were headedmr weasley pointed ahead of them where a large black mass rose beyond the village of ottery st catchpolewhat sort of objects are portkeys said harry curiouslywell they can be anything said mr weasley unobtrusive things obviously so muggles dont go picking them up and playing with them stuff theyll just think is litterthey trudged down the dark dank lane toward the village the silence broken only by their footsteps the sky lightened very slowly as they made their way through the village its inky blackness diluting to deepest blue harrys hands and feet were freezing mr weasley kept checking his watchthey didnt have breath to spare for talking as they began to climb stoatshead hill stumbling occasionally in hidden rabbit holes slipping on thick black tuffets of grass each breath harry took was sharp in his chest and his legs were starting to seize up when at last his feet found level groundwhew panted mr weasley taking off his glasses and wiping them on his sweater well weve made good time weve got ten minutes hermione came over the crest of the hill last clutching a stitch in her sidenow we just need the portkey said mr weasley replacing his glasses and squinting around at the ground it wont be big come onthey spread out searching they had only been at it for a couple of minutes however when a shout rent the still airover here arthur over here son weve got ittwo tall figures were silhouetted against the starry sky on the other side of the hilltopamos said mr weasley smiling as he strode over to the man who had shouted the rest of them followedmr weasley was shaking hands with a ruddyfaced wizard with a scrubby brown beard who was holding a moldylooking old boot in his other handthis is amos diggory everyone said mr weasley he works for the department for the regulation and control of magical creatures and i think you know his son cedriccedric diggory was an extremely handsome boy of around seventeen he was captain and seeker of the hufflepuff house quidditch team at hogwartshi said cedric looking around at them alleverybody said hi back except fred and george who merely nodded they had never quite forgiven cedric for beating their team gryffindor in the first quidditch match of the previous yearlong walk arthur cedrics father asked not too bad said mr weasley we live just on the other side of the village there youhad to get up at two didnt we ced i tell you ill be glad when hes got his apparition test still not complaining quidditch world cup wouldnt miss it for a sackful of galleons and the tickets cost about that mind you looks like i got off easy amos diggory peered goodnaturedly around at the three weasley boys harry hermione and ginny all these yours arthuroh no only the redheads said mr weasley pointing out his children this is hermione friend of rons and harry another friend merlins beard said amos diggory his eyes widening harry harry potterer yeah said harryharry was used to people looking curiously at him when they met him used to the way their eyes moved at once to the lightning scar on his forehead but it always made him feel uncomfortableceds talked about you of course said amos diggory told us all about playing against you last year i said to him i said ced thatll be something to tell your grandchildren that will you beat harry potterharry couldnt think of any reply to this so he remained silent fred and george were both scowling again cedric looked slightly embarrassedharry fell off his broom dad he muttered i told you it was an accidentyes but you didnt fall off did you roared amos genially slapping his son on his back always modest our ced always the gentleman but the best man won im sure harryd say the same wouldnt you eh one falls off his broom one stays on you dont need to be a genius to tell which ones the better fliermust be nearly time said mr weasley quickly pulling out his watch again do you know whether were waiting for any more amosno the lovegoods have been there for a week already and the fawcetts couldnt get tickets said mr diggory there arent any more of us in this area are therenot that i know of said mr weasley yes its a minute off wed better get readyhe looked around at harry and hermioneyou just need to touch the portkey thats all a finger will do with difficulty owing to their bulky backpacks the nine of them crowded around the old boot held out by amos diggorythey all stood there in a tight circle as a chill breeze swept over the hilltop nobody spoke it suddenly occurred to harry how odd this would look if a muggle were to walk up here now nine people two of them grown men clutching this manky old boot in the semidarkness waitingthree muttered mr weasley one eye still on his watch two one it happened immediately harry felt as though a hook just behind his navel had been suddenly jerked irresistibly forward his feet left the ground he could feel ron and hermione on either side of him their shoulders banging into his they were all speeding forward in a howl of wind and swirling color his forefinger was stuck to the boot as though it was pulling him magnetically onward and then his feet slammed into the ground ron staggered into him and he fell over the portkey hit the ground near his head with a heavy thudharry looked up mr weasley mr diggory and cedric were still standing though looking very windswept everybody else was on the groundseven past five from stoatshead hill said a voicechapter seven bagman and crouchharry disentangled himself from ron and got to his feet they had arrived on what appeared to be a deserted stretch of misty moor in front of them was a pair of tired and grumpylooking wizards one of whom was holding a large gold watch the other a thick roll of parchment and a quill both were dressed as muggles though very inexpertly the man with the watch wore a tweed suit with thighlength galoshes his colleague a kilt and a ponchomorning basil said mr weasley picking up the boot and handing it to the kilted wizard who threw it into a large box of used portkeys beside him harry could see an old newspaper an empty drinks can and a punctured footballhello there arthur said basil wearily not on duty eh its all right for some weve been here all night youd better get out of the way weve got a big party coming in from the black forest at five fifteen hang on ill find your campsite weasley weasley he consulted his parchment list about a quarter of a miles walk over there first field you come to site managers called mr roberts diggory second field ask for mr paynethanks basil said mr weasley and he beckoned everyone to follow himthey set off across the deserted moor unable to make out much through the mist after about twenty minutes a small stone cottage next to a gate swam into view beyond it harry could just make out the ghostly shapes of hundreds and hundreds of tents rising up the gentle slope of a large field toward a dark wood on the horizon they said goodbye to the diggorys and approached the cottage doora man was standing in the doorway looking out at the tents harry knew at a glance that this was the only real muggle for several acres when he heard their footsteps he turned his head to look at themmorning said mr weasley brightlymorning said the mugglewould you be mr robertsaye i would said mr roberts and whore youweasley two tents booked a couple of days agoaye said mr roberts consulting a list tacked to the door youve got a space up by the wood there just the one nightthats it said mr weasleyyoull be paying now then said mr robertsah right certainly said mr weasley he retreated a short distance from the cottage and beckoned harry toward him help me harry he muttered pulling a roll of muggle money from his pocket and starting to peel the notes apart this ones a a a ten ah yes i see the little number on it now so this is a fivea twenty harry corrected him in an undertone uncomfortably aware of mr roberts trying to catch every wordah yes so it is i dont know these little bits of paperyou foreign said mr roberts as mr weasley returned with the correct notesforeign repeated mr weasley puzzledyoure not the first one whos had trouble with money said mr roberts scrutinizing mr weasley closely i had two try and pay me with great gold coins the size of hubcaps ten minutes agodid you really said mr weasley nervouslymr roberts rummaged around in a tin for some changenever been this crowded he said suddenly looking out over the misty field again hundreds of prebookings people usually just turn upis that right said mr weasley his hand held out for his change but mr roberts didnt give it to himaye he said thoughtfully people from all over loads of foreigners and not just foreigners weirdos you know theres a bloke walking round in a kilt and a ponchoshouldnt he said mr weasley anxiouslyits like some sort of i dunno like some sort of rally said mr roberts they all seem to know each other like a big partyat that moment a wizard in plusfours appeared out of thin air next to mr robertss front doorobliviate he said sharply pointing his wand at mr robertsinstantly mr robertss eyes slid out of focus his brows unknitted and a took of dreamy unconcern fell over his face harry recognized the symptoms of one who had just had his memory modifieda map of the campsite for you mr roberts said placidly to mr weasley and your changethanks very much said mr weasleythe wizard in plusfours accompanied them toward the gate to the campsite he looked exhausted his chin was blue with stubble and there were deep purple shadows under his eyes once out of earshot of mr roberts he muttered to mr weasley been having a lot of trouble with him needs a memory charm ten times a day to keep him happy and ludo bagmans not helping trotting around talking about bludgers and quaffles at the top of his voice not a worry about antimuggle security blimey ill be glad when this is over see you later arthurhe disapparatedi thought mr bagman was head of magical games and sports said ginny looking surprised he should know better than to talk about bludgers near muggles shouldnt hehe should said mr weasley smiling and leading them through the gates into the campsite but ludos always been a bit well lax about security you couldnt wish for a more enthusiastic head of the sports department though he played quidditch for england himself you know and he was the best beater the wimbourne wasps ever hadthey trudged up the misty field between long rows of tents most looked almost ordinary their owners had clearly tried to make them as mugglelike as possible but had slipped up by adding chimneys or bellpulls or weather vanes however here and there was a tent so obviously magical that harry could hardly be surprised that mr roberts was getting suspicious halfway up the field stood an extravagant confection of striped silk like a miniature palace with several live peacocks tethered at the entrance a little farther on they passed a tent that had three floors and several turrets and a short way beyond that was a tent that had a front garden attached complete with birdbath sundial and fountainalways the same said mr weasley smiling we cant resist showing off when we get together ah here we are look this is usthey had reached the very edge of the wood at the top of the field and here was an empty space with a small sign hammered into the ground that read weezlycouldnt have a better spot said mr weasley happily the field is just on the other side of the wood there were as close as we could be he hoisted his backpack from his shoulders right he said excitedly no magic allowed strictly speaking not when were out in these numbers on muggle land well be putting these tents up by hand shouldnt be too difficult muggles do it all the time here harry where do you reckon we should startharry had never been camping in his life the dursleys had never taken him on any kind of holiday preferring to leave him with mrs figg an old neighbor however he and hermione worked out where most of the poles and pegs should go and though mr weasley was more of a hindrance than a help because he got thoroughly overexcited when it came to using the mallet they finally managed to erect a pair of shabby twoman tentsall of them stood back to admire their handiwork nobody looking at these tents would guess they belonged to wizards harry thought but the trouble was that once bill charlie and percy arrived they would be a party of ten hermione seemed to have spotted this problem too she gave harry a quizzical look as mr weasley dropped to his hands and knees and entered the first tentwell be a bit cramped he called but i think well all squeeze in come and have a lookharry bent down ducked under the tent flap and felt his jaw drop he had walked into what looked like an oldfashioned three room flat complete with bathroom and kitchen oddly enough it was furnished in exactly the same sort of style as mrs figgs house there were crocheted covers on the mismatched chairs and a strong smell of catswell its not for long said mr weasley mopping his bald patch with a handkerchief and peering in at the four bunk beds that stood in the bedroom i borrowed this from perkins at the office doesnt camp much anymore poor fellow hes got lumbagohe picked up the dusty kettle and peered inside it well need watertheres a tap marked on this map the muggle gave us said ron who had followed harry inside the tent and seemed completely unimpressed by its extraordinary inner proportions its on the other side of the fieldwell why dont you harry and hermione go and get us some water then mr weasley handed over the kettle and a couple of saucepans and the rest of us will get some wood for a firebut weve got an oven said ron why cant we just ron antimuggle security said mr weasley his face shining with anticipation when real muggles camp they cook on fires outdoors ive seen them at itafter a quick tour of the girls tent which was slightly smaller than the boys though without the smell of cats harry ron and hermione set off across the campsite with the kettle and saucepansnow with the sun newly risen and the mist lifting they could see the city of tents that stretched in every direction they made their way slowly through the rows staring eagerly around it was only just dawning on harry how many witches and wizards there must be in the world he had never really thought much about those in other countriestheir fellow campers were starting to wake up first to stir were the families with small children harry had never seen witches and wizards this young before a tiny boy no older than two was crouched outside a large pyramidshaped tent holding a wand and poking happily at a slug in the grass which was swelling slowly to the size of a salami as they drew level with him his mother came hurrying out of the tenthow many times kevin you dont touch daddys wand yecchh she had trodden on the giant slug which burst her scolding carried after them on the still air mingling with the little boys yells you bust slug you bust sluga short way farther on they saw two little witches barely older than kevin who were riding toy broomsticks that rose only high enough for the girls toes to skim the dewy grass a ministry wizard had already spotted them as he hurried past harry ron and hermione he muttered distractedly in broad daylight parents having a liein i suppose here and there adult wizards and witches were emerging from their tents and starting to cook breakfast some with furtive looks around them conjured fires with their wands others were striking matches with dubious looks on their faces as though sure this couldnt work three african wizards sat in serious conversation all of them wearing long white robes and roasting what looked like a rabbit on a bright purple fire while a group of middleaged american witches sat gossiping happily beneath a spangled banner stretched between their tents that read the salem witches institute harry caught snatches of conversation in strange languages from the inside of tents they passed and though he couldnt understand a word the tone of every single voice was exciteder is it my eyes or has everything gone green said ronit wasnt just rons eyes they had walked into a patch of tents that were all covered with a thick growth of shamrocks so that it looked as though small oddly shaped hillocks had sprouted out of the earth grinning faces could be seen under those that had their flaps open then from behind them they heard their namesharry ron hermioneit was seamus finnigan their fellow gryffindor fourth year he was sitting in front of his own shamrockcovered tent with a sandyhaired woman who had to be his mother and his best friend dean thomas also of gryffindorlike the decorations said seamus grinning the ministrys not too happyah why shouldnt we show our colors said mrs finnigan you should see what the bulgarians have got dangling all over their tents youll be supporting ireland of course she added eyeing harry ron and hermione beadily when they had assured her that they were indeed supporting ireland they set off again though as ron said like wed say anything else surrounded by that lot i wonder what the bulgarians have got dangling all over their tents said hermionelets go and have a look said harry pointing to a large patch of tents upfield where the bulgarian flag white green and red was fluttering in the breezethe tents here had not been bedecked with plant life but each and every one of them had the same poster attached to it a poster of a very surly face with heavy black eyebrows the picture was of course moving but all it did was blink and scowlkrum said ron quietlywhat said hermionekrum said ron viktor krum the bulgarian seekerhe looks really grumpy said hermione looking around at the many krums blinking and scowling at themreally grumpy ron raised his eyes to the heavens who cares what he looks like hes unbelievable hes really young too only just eighteen or something hes a genius you wait until tonight youll seethere was already a small queue for the tap in the corner of the field harry ron and hermione joined it right behind a pair of men who were having a heated argument one of them was a very old wizard who was wearing a long flowery nightgown the other was clearly a ministry wizard he was holding out a pair of pinstriped trousers and almost crying with exasperationjust put them on archie theres a good chap you cant walk around like that the muggle at the gates already getting suspicious i bought this in a muggle shop said the old wizard stubbornly muggles wear themmuggle women wear them archie not the men they wear these said the ministry wizard and he brandished the pinstriped trousersim not putting them on said old archie in indignation i like a healthy breeze round my privates thankshermione was overcome with such a strong fit of the giggles at this point that she had to duck out of the queue and only returned when archie had collected his water and moved awaywalking more slowly now because of the weight of the water they made their way back through the campsite here and there they saw more familiar faces other hogwarts students with their families oliver wood the old captain of harrys house quidditch team who had just left hogwarts dragged harry over to his parents tent to introduce him and told him excitedly that he had just been signed to the puddlemere united reserve team next they were hailed by ernie macmillan a hufflepuff fourth year and a little farther on they saw cho chang a very pretty girl who played seeker on the ravenclaw team she waved and smiled at harry who slopped quite a lot of water down his front as he waved back more to stop ron from smirking than anything harry hurriedly pointed out a large group of teenagers whom he had never seen beforewho dyou reckon they are he said they dont go to hogwarts do theyspect they go to some foreign school said ron i know there are others never met anyone who went to one though bill had a penfriend at a school in brazil this was years and years ago and he wanted to go on an exchange trip but mum and dad couldnt afford it his penfriend got all offended when he said he wasnt going and sent him a cursed hat it made his ears shrivel upharry laughed but didnt voice the amazement he felt at hearing about other wizarding schools he supposed now that he saw representatives of so many nationalities in the campsite that he had been stupid never to realize that hogwarts couldnt be the only one he glanced at hermione who looked utterly unsurprised by the information no doubt she had run across the news about other wizarding schools in some book or otheryouve been ages said george when they finally got back to the weasleys tentsmet a few people said ron setting the water down youve not got that fire started yetdads having fun with the matches said fredmr weasley was having no success at all in lighting the fire but it wasnt for lack of trying splintered matches littered the ground around him but he looked as though he was having the time of his lifeoops he said as he managed to light a match and promptly dropped it in surprisecome here mr weasley said hermione kindly taking the box from him and showing him how to do it properlyat last they got the fire lit though it was at least another hour before it was hot enough to cook anything there was plenty to watch while they waited however their tent seemed to be pitched right alongside a kind of thoroughfare to the field and ministry members kept hurrying up and down it greeting mr weasley cordially as they passed mr weasley kept up a running commentary mainly for harrys and hermiones benefit his own children knew too much about the ministry to be greatly interestedthat was cuthbert mockridge head of the goblin liaison office here comes gilbert wimple hes with the committee on experimental charms hes had those horns for a while now hello arnie arnold peasegood hes an obliviator member of the accidental magic reversal squad you know and thats bode and croaker theyre unspeakablestheyre whatfrom the department of mysteries top secret no idea what they get up toat last the fire was ready and they had just started cooking eggs and sausages when bill charlie and percy came strolling out of the woods toward themjust apparated dad said percy loudly ah excellent lunchthey were halfway through their plates of eggs and sausages when mr weasley jumped to his feet waving and grinning at a man who was striding toward them aha he said the man of the moment ludoludo bagman was easily the most noticeable person harry had seen so far even including old archie in his flowered nightdress he was wearing long quidditch robes in thick horizontal stripes of bright yellow and black an enormous picture of a wasp was splashed across his chest he had the look of a powerfully built man gone slightly to seed the robes were stretched tightly across a large belly he surely had not had in the days when he had played quidditch for england his nose was squashed probably broken by a stray bludger harry thought but his round blue eyes short blond hair and rosy complexion made him look like a very overgrown schoolboyahoy there bagman called happily he was walking as though he had springs attached to the balls of his feet and was plainly in a state of wild excitementarthur old man he puffed as he reached the campfire what a day eh what a day could we have asked for more perfect weather a cloudless night coming and hardly a hiccough in the arrangements not much for me to dobehind him a group of haggardlooking ministry wizards rushed past pointing at the distant evidence of some sort of a magical fire that was sending violet sparks twenty feet into the airpercy hurried forward with his hand outstretched apparently his disapproval of the way ludo bagman ran his department did not prevent him from wanting to make a good impressionah yes said mr weasley grinning this is my son percy hes just started at the ministry and this is fred no george sorry thats fred bill charlie ron my daughter ginny and rons friends hermione granger and harry potterbagman did the smallest of double takes when he heard harrys name and his eyes performed the familiar flick upward to the scar on harrys foreheadeveryone mr weasley continued this is ludo bagman you know who he is its thanks to him weve got such good tickets bagman beamed and waved his hand as if to say it had been nothingfancy a flutter on the match arthur he said eagerly jingling what seemed to be a large amount of gold in the pockets of his yellowandblack robes ive already got roddy pontner betting me bulgaria will score first i offered him nice odds considering irelands front three are the strongest ive seen in years and little agatha timms has put up half shares in her eel farm on a weeklong matchoh go on then said mr weasley lets see a galleon on ireland to wina galleon ludo bagman looked slightly disappointed but recovered himself very well very well any other takerstheyre a bit young to be gambling said mr weasley molly wouldnt like well bet thirtyseven galleons fifteen sickles three knuts said fred as he and george quickly pooled all their money that ireland wins but viktor krum gets the snitch oh and well throw in a fake wandyou dont want to go showing mr bagman rubbish like that percy hissed but bagman didnt seem to think the wand was rubbish at all on the contrary his boyish face shone with excitement as he took it from fred and when the wand gave a loud squawk and turned into a rubber chicken bagman roared with laughterexcellent i havent seen one that convincing in years id pay five galleons for thatpercy froze in an attitude of stunned disapprovalboys said mr weasley under his breath i dont want you betting thats all your savings your mother dont be a spoilsport arthur boomed ludo bagman rattling his pockets excitedly theyre old enough to know what they want you reckon ireland will win but krumll get the snitch not a chance boys not a chance ill give you excellent odds on that one well add five galleons for the funny wand then shall wemr weasley looked on helplessly as ludo bagman whipped out a notebook and quill and began jotting down the twins namescheers said george taking the slip of parchment bagman handed him and tucking it away into the front of his robes bagman turned most cheerfully back to mr weasleycouldnt do me a brew i suppose im keeping an eye out for barty crouch my bulgarian opposite numbers making difficulties and i cant understand a word hes saying bartyll be able to sort it out he speaks about a hundred and fifty languagesmr crouch said percy suddenly abandoning his look of pokerstiff disapproval and positively writhing with excitement he speaks over two hundred mermish and gobbledegook and troll anyone can speak troll said fred dismissively all you have to do is point and gruntpercy threw fred an extremely nasty look and stoked the fire vigorously to bring the kettle back to the boilany news of bertha jorkins yet ludo mr weasley asked as bagman settled himself down on the grass beside them allnot a dicky bird said bagman comfortably but shell turn up poor old bertha memory like a leaky cauldron and no sense of direction lost you take my word for it shell wander back into the office sometime in october thinking its still julyyou dont think it might be time to send someone to look for her mr weasley suggested tentatively as percy handed bagman his teabarty crouch keeps saying that said bagman his round eyes widening innocently but we really cant spare anyone at the moment oh talk of the devil bartya wizard had just apparated at their fireside and he could not have made more of a contrast with ludo bagman sprawled on the grass in his old wasp robes barty crouch was a stiff upright elderly man dressed in an impeccably crisp suit and tie the parting in his short gray hair was almost unnaturally straight and his narrow toothbrush mustache looked as though he trimmed it using a slide rule his shoes were very highly polished harry could see at once why percy idolized him percy was a great believer in rigidly following rules and mr crouch had complied with the rule about muggle dressing so thoroughly that he could have passed for a bank manager harry doubted even uncle vernon would have spotted him for what he really waspull up a bit of grass barry said ludo brightly patting the ground beside himno thank you ludo said crouch and there was a bite of impatience in his voice ive been looking for you everywhere the bulgarians are insisting we add another twelve seats to the top boxoh is that what theyre after said bagman i thought the chap was asking to borrow a pair of tweezers bit of a strong accentmr crouch said percy breathlessly sunk into a kind of halfbow that made him look like a hunchback would you like a cup of teaoh said mr crouch looking over at percy in mild surprise yes thank you weatherbyfred and george choked into their own cups percy very pink around the ears busied himself with the kettleoh and ive been wanting a word with you too arthur said mr crouch his sharp eyes falling upon mr weasley ali bashirs on the warpath he wants a word with you about your embargo on flying carpetsmr weasley heaved a deep sighi sent him an owl about that just last week if ive told him once ive told him a hundred times carpets are defined as a muggle artifact by the registry of proscribed charmable objects but will he listeni doubt it said mr crouch accepting a cup from percy hes desperate to export herewell theyll never replace brooms in britain will they said bagmanali thinks theres a niche in the market for a family vehicle said mr crouch i remember my grandfather had an axminster that could seat twelve but that was before carpets were banned of coursehe spoke as though he wanted to leave nobody in any doubt that all his ancestors had abided strictly by the lawso been keeping busy barty said bagman breezilyfairly said mr crouch dryly organizing portkeys across five continents is no mean feat ludoi expect youll both be glad when this is over said mr weasleyludo bagman looked shockedglad dont know when ive had more fun still its not as though we havent got anything to took forward to eh barty eh plenty left to organize ehmr crouch raised his eyebrows at bagmanwe agreed not to make the announcement until all the details oh details said bagman waving the word away like a cloud of midges theyve signed havent they theyve agreed havent they i bet you anything these kidsll know soon enough anyway i mean its happening at hogwarts ludo we need to meet the bulgarians you know said mr crouch sharply cutting bagmans remarks short thank you for the tea weatherbyhe pushed his undrunk tea back at percy and waited for ludo to rise bagman struggled to his feet swigging down the last of his tea the gold in his pockets chinking merrilysee you all later he said youll be up in the top box with me im commentating he waved barty crouch nodded curtly and both of them disapparatedwhats happening at hogwarts dad said fred at once what were they talking aboutyoull find out soon enough said mrweasley smilingits classified information until such time as the ministry decides to release it said percy stiffly mr crouch was quite right not to disclose itoh shut up weatherby said freda sense of excitement rose like a palpable cloud over the campsite as the afternoon wore on by dusk the still summer air itself seemed to be quivering with anticipation and as darkness spread like a curtain over the thousands of waiting wizards the last vestiges of pretence disappeared the ministry seemed to have bowed to the inevitable and stopped fighting the signs of blatant magic now breaking out everywheresalesmen were apparating every few feet carrying trays and pushing carts full of extraordinary merchandise there were luminous rosettes green for ireland red for bulgaria which were squealing the names of the players pointed green hats bedecked with dancing shamrocks bulgarian scarves adorned with lions that really roared flags from both countries that played their national anthems as they were waved there were tiny models of firebolts that really flew and collectible figures of famous players which strolled across the palm of your hand preening themselvesbeen saving my pocket money all summer for this ron told harry as they and hermione strolled through the salesmen buying souvenirs though ron purchased a dancing shamrock hat and a large green rosette he also bought a small figure of viktor krum the bulgarian seeker the miniature krum walked backward and forward over rons hand scowling up at the green rosette above himwow look at these said harry hurrying over to a cart piled high with what looked like brass binoculars except that they were covered with all sorts of weird knobs and dialsomnioculars said the saleswizard eagerly you can replay action slow everything down and they flash up a playby play breakdown if you need it bargain ten galleons eachwish i hadnt bought this now said ron gesturing at his dancing shamrock hat and gazing longingly at the omniocularsthree pairs said harry firmly to the wizardno dont bother said ron going red he was always touchy about the fact that harry who had inherited a small fortune from his parents had much more money than he didyou wont be getting anything for christmas harry told him thrusting omnioculars into his and hermiones hands for about ten years mindfair enough said ron grinningoooh thanks harry said hermione and ill get us some programs look their money bags considerably lighter they went back to the tents bill charlie and ginny were all sporting green rosettes too and mr weasley was carrying an irish flag fred and george had no souvenirs as they had given bagman all their goldand then a deep booming gong sounded somewhere beyond the woods and at once green and red lanterns blazed into life in the trees lighting a path to the fieldits time said mr weasley looking as excited as any of them come on lets gochapter eight the quidditch world cupclutching their purchases mr weasley in the lead they all hurried into the wood following the lanternlit trail they could hear the sounds of thousands of people moving around them shouts and laughter snatches of singing the atmosphere of feverish excitement was highly infectious harry couldnt stop grinning they walked through the wood for twenty minutes talking and joking loudly until at last they emerged on the other side and found themselves in the shadow of a gigantic stadium though harry could see only a fraction of the immense gold walls surrounding the field he could tell that ten cathedrals would fit comfortably inside itseats a hundred thousand said mr weasley spotting the awestruck look on harrys face ministry task force of five hundred have been working on it all year muggle repelling charms on every inch of it every time muggles have got anywhere near here all year theyve suddenly remembered urgent appointments and had to dash away again bless them he added fondly leading the way toward the nearest entrance which was already surrounded by a swarm of shouting witches and wizardsprime seats said the ministry witch at the entrance when she checked their tickets top box straight upstairs arthur and as high as you can gothe stairs into the stadium were carpeted in rich purple they clambered upward with the rest of the crowd which slowly filtered away through doors into the stands to their left and right mr weasleys party kept climbing and at last they reached the top of the staircase and found themselves in a small box set at the highest point of the stadium and situated exactly halfway between the golden goal posts about twenty purpleandgilt chairs stood in two rows here and harry filing into the front seats with the weasleys looked down upon a scene the likes of which he could never have imagineda hundred thousand witches and wizards were taking their places in the seats which rose in levels around the long oval field everything was suffused with a mysterious golden light which seemed to come from the stadium itself the field looked smooth as velvet from their lofty position at either end of the field stood three goal hoops fifty feet high right opposite them almost at harrys eye level was a gigantic blackboard gold writing kept dashing across it as though an invisible giants hand were scrawling upon the blackboard and then wiping it off again watching it harry saw that it was flashing advertisements across the fieldthe bluebottle a broom for all the family safe reliable and with builtin antiburgler buzzer mrs showers all purpose magical mess remover no pain no stain gladrags wizardwear london paris hogsmeadeharry tore his eyes away from the sign and looked over his shoulder to see who else was sharing the box with them so far it was empty except for a tiny creature sitting in the second from last seat at the end of the row behind them the creature whose legs were so short they stuck out in front of it on the chair was wearing a tea towel draped like a toga and it had its face hidden in its hands yet those long batlike ears were oddly familiardobby said harry incredulouslythe tiny creature looked up and stretched its fingers revealing enormous brown eyes and a nose the exact size and shape of a large tomato it wasnt dobby it was however unmistakably a houseelf as harrys friend dobby had been harry had set dobby free from his old owners the malfoy familydid sir just call me dobby squeaked the elf curiously from between its fingers its voice was higher even than dobbys had been a teeny quivering squeak of a voice and harry suspected though it was very hard to tell with a houseelf that this one might just be female ron and hermione spun around in their seats to look though they had heard a lot about dobby from harry they had never actually met him even mr weasley looked around in interestsorry harry told the elf i just thought you were someone i knewbut i knows dobby too sir squeaked the elf she was shielding her face as though blinded by light though the top box was not brightly lit my name is winky sir and you sir her dark brown eyes widened to the size of side plates as they rested upon harrys scar you is surely harry potteryeah i am said harrybut dobby talks of you all the time sir s he said lowering her hands very slightly and looking awestruckhow is he said harry hows freedom suiting himah sir said winky shaking her head ah sir meaning no disrespect sir but i is not sure you did dobby a favor sir when you is setting him freewhy said harry taken aback whats wrong with himfreedom is going to dobbys head sir said winky sadly ideas above his station sir cant get another position sirwhy not said harrywinky lowered her voice by a halfoctave and whispered he is wanting paying for his work sirpaying said harry blankly well why shouldnt he be paidwinky looked quite horrified at the idea and closed her fingers slightly so that her face was halfhidden againhouseelves is not paid sir she said in a muffled squeak no no no i says to dobby i says go find yourself a nice family and settle down dobby he is getting up to all sorts of high jinks sir what is unbecoming to a houseelf you goes racketing around like this dobby i says and next thing i hear yous up in front of the department for the regulation and control of magical creatures like some common goblinwell its about time he had a bit of fun said harryhouseelves is not supposed to have fun harry potter said winky firmly from behind her hands houseelves does what they is told i is not liking heights at all harry potter she glanced toward the edge of the box and gulped but my master sends me to the top box and i comes sirwhys he sent you up here if he knows you dont like heights said harry frowningmaster master wants me to save him a seat harry potter he is very busy said winky tilting her head toward the empty space beside her winky is wishing she is back in masters tent harry potter but winky does what she is told winky is a good houseelfshe gave the edge of the box another frightened look and hid her eyes completely again harry turned back to the othersso thats a houseelf ron muttered weird things arent theydobby was weirder said harry ferventlyron pulled out his omnioculars and started testing them staring down into the crowd on the other side of the stadiumwild he said twiddling the replay knob on the side i can make that old bloke down there pick his nose again and again and again hermione meanwhile was skimming eagerly through her velvetcovered tasseled programa display from the team mascots will precede the match she read aloudoh thats always worth watching said mr weasley national teams bring creatures from their native land you know to put on a bit of a showthe box filled gradually around them over the next half hour mr weasley kept shaking hands with people who were obviously very important wizards percy jumped to his feet so often that he looked as though he were trying to sit on a hedgehog when cornelius fudge the minister of magic himself arrived percy bowed so low that his glasses fell off and shattered highly embarrassed he repaired them with his wand and thereafter remained in his seat throwing jealous looks at harry whom cornelius fudge had greeted like an old friend they had met before and fudge shook harrys hand in a fatherly fashion asked how he was and introduced him to the wizards on either side of himharry potter you know he told the bulgarian minister loudly who was wearing splendid robes of black velvet trimmed with gold and didnt seem to understand a word of english harry potter oh come on now you know who he is the boy who survived youknowwho you do know who he is the bulgarian wizard suddenly spotted harrys scar and started gabbling loudly and excitedly pointing at itknew wed get there in the end said fudge wearily to harry im no great shakes at languages i need barty crouch for this sort of thing ah i see his houseelfs saving him a seat good job too these bulgarian blighters have been trying to cadge all the best places ah and heres luciusharry ron and hermione turned quickly edging along the second row to three stillempty seats right behind mr weasley were none other than dobby the houseelfs former owners lucius malfoy his son draco and a woman harry supposed must be dracos motherharry and draco malfoy had been enemies ever since their very first journey to hogwarts a pale boy with a pointed face and whiteblond hair draco greatly resembled his father his mother was blonde too tall and slim she would have been nicelooking if she hadnt been wearing a look that suggested there was a nasty smell under her noseah fudge said mr malfoy holding out his hand as he reached the minister of magic how are you i dont think youve met my wife narcissa or our son dracohow do you do how do you do said fudge smiling and bowing to mrs malfoy and allow me to introduce you to mr oblansk obalonsk mr well hes the bulgarian minister of magic and he cant understand a word im saying anyway so never mind and lets see who else you know arthur weasley i daresayit was a tense moment mr weasley and mr malfoy looked at each other and harry vividly recalled the last time they had come facetoface it had been in flourish and blotts bookshop and they had had a fight mr malfoys cold gray eyes swept over mr weasley and then up and down the rowgood lord arthur he said softly what did you have to sell to get seats in the top box surely your house wouldnt have fetched this muchfudge who wasnt listening said lucius has just given a very generous contribution to st mungos hospital for magical maladies and injuries arthur hes here as my guesthow how nice said mr weasley with a very strained smilemr malfoys eyes had returned to hermione who went slightly pink but stared determinedly back at him harry knew exactly what was making mr malfoys lip curl like that the malfoys prided themselves on being purebloods in other words they considered anyone of muggle descent like hermione secondclass however under the gaze of the minister of magic mr malfoy didnt dare say anything he nodded sneeringly to mr weasley and continued down the line to his seats draco shot harry ron and hermione one contemptuous look then settled himself between his mother and fatherslimy gits ron muttered as he harry and hermione turned to face the field again next moment ludo bagman charged into the boxeveryone ready he said his round face gleaming like a great excited edam minister ready to goready when you are ludo said fudge comfortablyludo whipped out his wand directed it at his own throat and said sonorus and then spoke over the roar of sound that was now filling the packed stadium his voice echoed over them booming into every corner of the standsladies and gentlemen welcome welcome to the final of the four hundred and twentysecond quidditch world cupthe spectators screamed and clapped thousands of flags waved adding their discordant national anthems to the racket the huge blackboard opposite them was wiped clear of its last message bertie botts every flavor beans a risk with every mouthful and now showed bulgaria ireland and now without further ado allow me to introduce the bulgarian national team mascotsthe righthand side of the stands which was a solid block of scarlet roared its approvali wonder what theyve brought said mr weasley leaning forward in his seat aaah he suddenly whipped off his glasses and polished them hurriedly on his robes veelawhat are veel but a hundred veela were now gliding out onto the field and harrys question was answered for him veela were women the most beautiful women harry had ever seen except that they werent they couldnt be human this puzzled harry for a moment while he tried to guess what exactly they could be what could make their skin shine moonbright like that or their whitegold hair fan out behind them without wind but then the music started and harry stopped worrying about them not being human in fact he stopped worrying about anything at allthe veela had started to dance and harrys mind had gone completely and blissfully blank all that mattered in the world was that he kept watching the veela because if they stopped dancing terrible things would happenand as the veela danced faster and faster wild halfformed thoughts started chasing through harrys dazed mind he wanted to do something very impressive right now jumping from the box into the stadium seemed a good idea but would it be good enoughharry what are you doing said hermiones voice from a long way offthe music stopped harry blinked he was standing up and one of his legs was resting on the wall of the box next to him ron was frozen in an attitude that looked as though he were about to dive from a springboardangry yells were filling the stadium the crowd didnt want the veela to go harry was with them he would of course be supporting bulgaria and he wondered vaguely why he had a large green shamrock pinned to his chest ron meanwhile was absentmindedly shredding the shamrocks on his hat mr weasley smiling slightly leaned over to ron and tugged the hat out of his handsyoull be wanting that he said once ireland have had their sayhuh said ron staring openmouthed at the veela who had now lined up along one side of the fieldhermione made a loud tutting noise she reached up and pulled harry back into his seat honestly she saidand now roared ludo bagmans voice kindly put your wands in the air for the irish national team mascotsnext moment what seemed to be a great greenandgold comet came zooming into the stadium it did one circuit of the stadium then split into two smaller comets each hurtling toward the goal posts a rainbow arced suddenly across the field connecting the two balls of light the crowd oooohed and aaaaahed as though at a fireworks display now the rainbow faded and the balls of light reunited and merged they had formed a great shimmering shamrock which rose up into the sky and began to soar over the stands something like golden rain seemed to be falling from it excellent yelled ron as the shamrock soared over them and heavy gold coins rained from it bouncing off their heads and seats squinting up at the shamrock harry realized that it was actually comprised of thousands of tiny little bearded men with red vests each carrying a minute lamp of gold or greenleprechauns said mr weasley over the tumultuous applause of the crowd many of whom were still fighting and rummaging around under their chairs to retrieve the goldthere you go ron yelled happily stuffing a fistful of gold coins into harrys hand for the omnioculars now youve got to buy me a christmas present hathe great shamrock dissolved the leprechauns drifted down onto the field on the opposite side from the veela and settled themselves crosslegged to watch the matchand now ladies and gentlemen kindly welcome the bulgarian national quidditch team i give you dimitrova scarletclad figure on a broomstick moving so fast it was blurred shot out onto the field from an entrance far below to wild applause from the bulgarian supportersivanovaa second scarletrobed player zoomed outzograf levski vulchanov volkov aaaaaaand krumthats him thats him yelled ron following krum with his omnioculars harry quickly focused his ownviktor krum was thin dark and sallowskinned with a large curved nose and thick black eyebrows he looked like an overgrown bird of prey it was hard to believe he was only eighteenand now please greet the irish national quidditch team yelled bagman presenting connolly ryan troy mullet moran quigley aaaaaand lynchseven green blurs swept onto the field harry spun a small dial on the side of his omnioculars and slowed the players down enough to read the word firebolt on each of their brooms and see their names embroidered in silver upon their backsand here all the way from egypt our referee acclaimed chairwizard of the international association of quidditch hassan mostafaa small and skinny wizard completely bald but with a mustache to rival uncle vernons wearing robes of pure gold to match the stadium strode out onto the field a silver whistle was protruding from under the mustache and he was carrying a large wooden crate under one arm his broomstick under the other harry spun the speed dial on his omnioculars back to normal watching closely as mostafa mounted his broomstick and kicked the crate open four balls burst into the air the scarlet quaffle the two black bludgers and harry saw it for the briefest moment before it sped out of sight the minuscule winged golden snitch with a sharp blast on his whistle mostafa shot into the air after the ballstheeeeeeeeyre off screamed bagman and its mullet troy moran dimitrov back to mullet troy levski moranit was quidditch as harry had never seen it played before he was pressing his omnioculars so hard to his glasses that they were cutting into the bridge of his nose the speed of the players was incredible the chasers were throwing the quaffle to one another so fast that bagman only had time to say their names harry spun the slow dial on the right of his omnioculars again pressed the playbyplay button on the top and he was immediately watching in slow motion while glittering purple lettering flashed across the lenses and the noise of the crowd pounded against his eardrumshawkshead attacking formation he read as he watched the three irish chasers zoom closely together troy in the center slightly ahead of mullet and moran bearing down upon the bulgarians porskoff ploy flashed up next as troy made as though to dart upward with the quaffle drawing away the bulgarian chaser ivanova and dropping the quaffle to moran one of the bulgarian beaters volkov swung hard at a passing bludger with his small club knocking it into morans path moran ducked to avoid the bludger and dropped the quaffle and levski soaring beneath caught it troy scores roared bagman and the stadium shuddered with a roar of applause and cheers ten zero to irelandwhat harry yelled looking wildly around through his omnioculars but levskis got the quaffleharry if youre not going to watch at normal speed youre going to miss things shouted hermione who was dancing up and down waving her arms in the air while troy did a lap of honor around the field harry looked quickly over the top of his omnioculars and saw that the leprechauns watching from the sidelines had all risen into the air again and formed the great glittering shamrock across the field the veela were watching them sulkilyfurious with himself harry spun his speed dial back to normal as play resumedharry knew enough about quidditch to see that the irish chasers were superb they worked as a seamless team their movements so well coordinated that they appeared to be reading one anothers minds as they positioned themselves and the rosette on harrys chest kept squeaking their names troy mullet mo ran and within ten minutes ireland had scored twice more bringing their lead to thirtyzero and causing a thunderous tide of roars and applause from the greenclad supportersthe match became still faster but more brutal volkov and vulchanov the bulgarian beaters were whacking the bludgers as fiercely as possible at the irish chasers and were starting to prevent them from using some of their best moves twice they were forced to scatter and then finally ivanova managed to break through their ranks dodge the keeper ryan and score bulgarias first goalfingers in your ears bellowed mr weasley as the veela started to dance in celebration harry screwed up his eyes too he wanted to keep his mind on the game after a few seconds he chanced a glance at the field the veela had stopped dancing and bulgaria was again in possession of the quaffledimitrov levski dimitrov ivanova oh i say roared bagmanone hundred thousand wizards gasped as the two seekers krum and lynch plummeted through the center of the chasers so fast that it looked as though they had just jumped from airplanes without parachutes harry followed their descent through his omnioculars squinting to see where the snitch was theyre going to crash screamed hermione next to harryshe was half right at the very last second viktor krum pulled out of the dive and spiraled off lynch however hit the ground with a dull thud that could be heard throughout the stadium a huge groan rose from the irish seatsfool moaned mr weasley krum was feintingits timeout yelled bagmans voice as trained mediwizards hurry onto the field to examine aidan lynchhell be okay he only got ploughed charlie said reassuringly to ginny who was hanging over the side of the box looking horrorstruck which is what krum was after of course harry hastily pressed the replay and playbyplay buttons on his omnioculars twiddled the speed dial and put them back up to his eyeshe watched as krum and lynch dived again in slow motion wronski defensive feint dangerous seeker diversion read the shining purple lettering across his lenses he saw krums face contorted with concentration as he pulled out of the dive just in time while lynch was flattened and he understood krum hadnt seen the snitch at all he was just making lynch copy him harry had never seen anyone fly like that krum hardly looked as though he was using a broomstick at all he moved so easily through the air that he looked unsupported and weightless harry turned his omnioculars back to normal and focused them on krum he was now circling high above lynch who was being revived by mediwizards with cups of potion harry focusing still more closely upon krums face saw his dark eyes darting all over the ground a hundred feet below he was using the time while lynch was revived to look for the snitch without interferencelynch got to his feet at last to loud cheers from the greenclad supporters mounted his firebolt and kicked back off into the air his revival seemed to give ireland new heart when mostafa blew his whistle again the chasers moved into action with a skill unrivaled by anything harry had seen so farafter fifteen more fast and furious minutes ireland had pulled ahead by ten more goals they were now leading by one hundred and thirty points to ten and the game was starting to get dirtieras mullet shot toward the goal posts yet again clutching the quaffle tightly under her arm the bulgarian keeper zograf flew out to meet her whatever happened was over so quickly harry didnt catch it but a scream of rage from the irish crowd and mostafas long shrill whistle blast told him it had been a fouland mostafa takes the bulgarian keeper to task for cobbing excessive use of elbows bagman informed the roaring spectators and yes its a penalty to irelandthe leprechauns who had risen angrily into the air like a swarm of glittering hornets when mullet had been fouled now darted together to form the words ha ha ha the veela on the other side of the field leapt to their feet tossed their hair angrily and started to dance againas one the weasley boys and harry stuffed their fingers into their ears but hermione who hadnt bothered was soon tugging on harrys arm he turned to look at her and she pulled his fingers impatiently out of his earslook at the referee she said gigglingharry looked down at the field hassan mostafa had landed right in front of the dancing veela and was acting very oddly indeed he was flexing his muscles and smoothing his mustache excitedlynow we cant have that said ludo bagman though he sounded highly amused somebody slap the refereea mediwizard came tearing across the field his fingers stuffed into his own ears and kicked mostafa hard in the shins mostafa seemed to come to himself harry watching through the omnioculars again saw that he looked exceptionally embarrassed and had started shouting at the veela who had stopped dancing and were looking mutinousand unless im much mistaken mostafa is actually attempting to send off the bulgarian team mascots said bagmans voice now theres something we havent seen before oh this could turn nasty it did the bulgarian beaters volkov and vulchanov landed on either side of mostafa and began arguing furiously with him gesticulating toward the leprechauns who had now gleefully formed the words hee hee hee mostafa was not impressed by the bulgarians arguments however he was jabbing his finger into the air clearly telling them to get flying again and when they refused he gave two short blasts on his whistletwo penalties for ireland shouted bagman and the bulgarian crowd howled with anger and volkov and vulchanov had better get back on those brooms yes there they go and troy takes the quaffle play now reached a level of ferocity beyond anything they had yet seen the beaters on both sides were acting without mercy volkov and vulchanov in particular seemed not to care whether their clubs made contact with bludger or human as they swung them violently through the air dimitrov shot straight at moran who had the quaffle nearly knocking her off her broomfoul roared the irish supporters as one all standing up in a great wave of greenfoul echoed ludo bagmans magically magnified voice dimitrov skins moran deliberately flying to collide there and its got to be another penalty yes theres the whistlethe leprechauns had risen into the air again and this time they formed a giant hand which was making a very rude sign indeed at the veela across the field at this the veela lost control instead of dancing they launched themselves across the field and began throwing what seemed to be handfuls of fire at the leprechauns watching through his omnioculars harry saw that they didnt look remotely beautiful now on the contrary their faces were elongating into sharp cruelbeaked bird heads and long scaly wings were bursting from their shoulders and that boys yelled mr weasley over the tumult of the crowd below is why you should never go for looks aloneministry wizards were flooding onto the field to separate the veela and the leprechauns but with little success meanwhile the pitched battle below was nothing to the one taking place above harry turned this way and that staring through his omnioculars as the quaffie changed hands with the speed of a bulletlevski dimitrov moran troy mullet ivanova moran again moran moran scoresbut the cheers of the irish supporters were barely heard over the shrieks of the veela the blasts now issuing from the ministry members wands and the furious roars of the bulgarians the game recommenced immediately now levski had the quaffle now dimitrov the irish beater quigley swung heavily at a passing bludger and hit it as hard as possible toward krum who did not duck quickly enough it hit him full in the facethere was a deafening groan from the crowd krums nose looked broken there was blood everywhere but hassan mostafa didnt blow his whistle he had become distracted and harry couldnt blame him one of the veela had thrown a handful of fire and set his broom tail alightharry wanted someone to realize that krum was injured even though he was supporting ireland krum was the most exciting player on the field ron obviously felt the sametimeout ah come on he cant play like that look at him look at lynch harry yelledfor the irish seeker had suddenly gone into a dive and harry was quite sure that this was no wronski feint this was the real thinghes seen the snitch harry shouted hes seen it look at him gohalf the crowd seemed to have realized what was happening the irish supporters rose in another great wave of green screaming their seeker on but krum was on his tail how he could see where he was going harry had no idea there were flecks of blood flying through the air behind him but he was drawing level with lynch now as the pair of them hurtled toward the ground again theyre going to crash shrieked hermionetheyre not roared ronlynch is yelled harryand he was right for the second time lynch hit the ground with tremendous force and was immediately stampeded by a horde of angry veelathe snitch wheres the snitch bellowed charlie along the rowhes got it krums got it its all over shouted harrykrum his red robes shining with blood from his nose was rising gently into the air his fist held high a glint of gold in his handthe scoreboard was flashing bulgaria ireland across the crowd who didnt seem to have realized what had happened then slowly as though a great jumbo jet were revving up the rumbling from the ireland supporters grew louder and louder and erupted into screams of delightireland wins bagman shouted who like the irish seemed to be taken aback by the sudden end of the matchkrum gets the snitch but ireland wins good lord i dont think any of us were expecting thatwhat did he catch the snitch for ron bellowed even as he jumped up and down applauding with his hands over his head he ended it when ireland were a hundred and sixty points ahead the idiothe knew they were never going to catch up harry shouted back over all the noise also applauding loudly the irish chasers were too good he wanted to end it on his terms thats all he was very brave wasnt he hermione said leaning forward to watch krum land as a swarm of mediwizards blasted a path through the battling leprechauns and veela to get to him he looks a terrible mess harry put his omnioculars to his eyes again it was hard to see what was happening below because leprechauns were zooming delightedly all over the field but he could just make out krum surrounded by mediwizards he looked surlier than ever and refused to let them mop him up his team members were around him shaking their heads and looking dejected a short way away the irish players were dancing gleefully in a shower of gold descending from their mascots flags were waving all over the stadium the irish national anthem blared from all sides the veela were shrinking back into their usual beautiful selves now though looking dispirited and forlornvell ve fought bravely said a gloomy voice behind harry he looked around it was the bulgarian minister of magicyou can speak english said fudge sounding outraged and youve been letting me mime everything all dayveil it vos very funny said the bulgarian minister shruggingand as the irish team performs a lap of honor flanked by their mascots the quidditch world cup itself is brought into the top box roared bagmanharrys eyes were suddenly dazzled by a blinding white light as the top box was magically illuminated so that everyone in the stands could see the inside squinting toward the entrance he saw two panting wizards carrying a vast golden cup into the box which they handed to cornelius fudge who was still looking very disgruntled that hed been using sign language all day for nothinglets have a really loud hand for the gallant losers bulgaria bagman shoutedand up the stairs into the box came the seven defeated bulgarian players the crowd below was applauding appreciatively harry could see thousands and thousands of omniocular lenses flashing and winking in their directionone by one the bulgarians filed between the rows of seats in the box and bagman called out the name of each as they shook hands with their own minister and then with fudge krum who was last in line looked a real mess two black eyes were blooming spectacularly on his bloody face he was still holding the snitch harry noticed that he seemed much less coordinated on the ground he was slightly duckfooted and distinctly roundshouldered but when krums name was announced the whole stadium gave him a resounding earsplitting roarand then came the irish team aidan lynch was being supported by moran and connolly the second crash seemed to have dazed him and his eyes looked strangely unfocused but he grinned happily as troy and quigley lifted the cup into the air and the crowd below thundered its approval harrys hands were numb with clappingat last when the irish team had left the box to perform another lap of honor on their brooms aidan lynch on the back of confollys clutching hard around his waist and still grinning in a bemused sort of way bagman pointed his wand at his throat and muttered quietustheyll be talking about this one for years he said hoarsely a really unexpected twist that shame it couldnt have lasted longer ah yes yes i owe you how muchfor fred and george had just scrambled over the backs of their seats and were standing in front of ludo bagman with broad grins on their faces their hands outstretched chapter nine the dark markdont tell your mother youve been gambling mr weasley implored fred and george as they all made their way slowly down the purplecarpeted stairsdont worry dad said fred gleefully weve got big plans for this money we dont want it confiscatedmr weasley looked for a moment as though he was going to ask what these big plans were but seemed to decide upon reflection that he didnt want to knowthey were soon caught up in the crowds now flooding out of the stadium and back to their campsites raucous singing was borne toward them on the night air as they retraced their steps along the lanternlit path and leprechauns kept shooting over their heads cackling and waving their lanterns when they finally reached the tents nobody felt like sleeping at all and given the level of noise around them mr weasley agreed that they could all have one last cup of cocoa together before turning in they were soon arguing enjoyably about the match mr weasley got drawn into a disagreement about cobbing with charlie and it was only when ginny fell asleep right at the tiny table and spilled hot chocolate all over the floor that mr weasley called a halt to the verbal replays and insisted that everyone go to bed hermione and ginny went into the next tent and harry and the rest of the weasleys changed into pajamas and clambered into their bunks from the other side of the campsite they could still hear much singing and the odd echoing bangoh i am glad im not on duty muttered mr weasley sleepily i wouldnt fancy having to go and tell the irish theyve got to stop celebratingharry who was on a top bunk above ron lay staring up at the canvas ceiling of the tent watching the glow of an occasional leprechaun lantern flying overhead and picturing again some of krums more spectacular moves he was itching to get back on his own firebolt and try out the wronski feint somehow oliver wood had never managed to convey with all his wriggling diagrams what that move was supposed to look like harry saw himself in robes that had his name on the back and imagined the sensation of hearing a hundredthousandstrong crowd roar as ludo bagmans voice echoed throughout the stadium i give you potterharry never knew whether or not he had actually dropped off to sleep his fantasies of flying like krum might well have slipped into actual dreams all he knew was that quite suddenly mr weasley was shoutingget up ron harry come on now get up this is urgentharry sat up quickly and the top of his head hit canvass matter he saiddimly he could tell that something was wrong the noises in the campsite had changed the singing had stopped he could hear screams and the sound of people running he slipped down from the bunk and reached for his clothes but mr weasley who had pulled on his jeans over his own pajamas said no time harry just grab a jacket and get outside quicklyharry did as he was told and hurried out of the tent ron at his heelsby the light of the few fires that were still burning he could see people running away into the woods fleeing something that was moving across the field toward them something that was emitting odd flashes of light and noises like gunfire loud jeering roars of laughter and drunken yells were drifting toward them then came a burst of strong green light which illuminated the scenea crowd of wizards tightly packed and moving together with wands pointing straight upward was marching slowly across the field harry squinted at them they didnt seem to have faces then he realized that their heads were hooded and their faces masked high above them floating along in midair four struggling figures were being contorted into grotesque shapes it was as though the masked wizards on the ground were puppeteers and the people above them were marionettes operated by invisible strings that rose from the wands into the air two of the figures were very smallmore wizards were joining the marching group laughing and pointing up at the floating bodies tents crumpled and fell as the marching crowd swelled once or twice harry saw one of the marchers blast a tent out of his way with his wand several caught fire the screaming grew louderthe floating people were suddenly illuminated as they passed over a burning tent and harry recognized one of them mr roberts the campsite manager the other three looked as though they might be his wife and children one of the marchers below flipped mrs roberts upside down with his wand her nightdress fell down to reveal voluminous drawers and she struggled to cover herself up as the crowd below her screeched and hooted with gleethats sick ron muttered watching the smallest muggle child who had begun to spin like a top sixty feet above the ground his head flopping limply from side to side that is really sick hermione and ginny came hurrying toward them pulling coats over their nightdresses with mr weasley right behind them at the same moment bill charlie and percy emerged from the boys tent fully dressed with their sleeves rolled up and their wands outwere going to help the ministry mr weasley shouted over all the noise rolling up his own sleeves you lot get into the woods and stick together ill come and fetch you when weve sorted this outbill charlie and percy were already sprinting away toward the oncoming marchers mr weasley tore after them ministry wizards were dashing from every direction toward the source of the trouble the crowd beneath the roberts family was coming ever closercmon said fred grabbing ginnys hand and starting to pull her toward the wood harry ron hermione and george followed they all looked back as they reached the trees the crowd beneath the roberts family was larger than ever they could see the ministry wizards trying to get through it to the hooded wizards in the center but they were having great difficulty it looked as though they were scared to perform any spell that might make the roberts family fallthe colored lanterns that had lit the path to the stadium had been extinguished dark figures were blundering through the trees children were crying anxious shouts and panicked voices were reverberating around them in the cold night air harry felt himself being pushed hither and thither by people whose faces he could not see then he heard ron yell with painwhat happened said hermione anxiously stopping so abruptly that harry walked into her ron where are you oh this is stupid lumosshe illuminated her wand and directed its narrow beam across the path ron was lying sprawled on the groundtripped over a tree root he said angrily getting to his feet againwell with feet that size hard not to said a drawling voice from behind themharry ron and hermione turned sharply draco malfoy was standing alone nearby leaning against a tree looking utterly relaxed his arms folded he seemed to have been watching the scene at the campsite through a gap in the treesron told malfoy to do something that harry knew he would never have dared say in front of mrs weasleylanguage weasley said malfoy his pale eyes glittering hadnt you better be hurrying along now you wouldnt like her spotted would youhe nodded at hermione and at the same moment a blast like a bomb sounded from the campsite and a flash of green light momentarily lit the trees around themwhats that supposed to mean said hermione defiantly granger theyre after muggles said malfoy dyou want to be showing off your knickers in midair because if you do hang around theyre moving this way and it would give us all a laughhermiones a witch harry snarledhave it your own way potter said malfoy grinning maliciously if you think they cant spot a mudblood stay where you areyou watch your mouth shouted ron everybody present knew that mudblood was a very offensive term for a witch or wizard of muggle parentagenever mind ron said hermione quickly seizing rons arm to restrain him as he took a step toward malfoythere came a bang from the other side of the trees that was louder than anything they had heard several people nearby screamed malfoy chuckled softlyscare easily dont they he said lazily i suppose your daddy told you all to hide whats he up to trying to rescue the muggleswherere your parents said harry his temper rising out there wearing masks are theymalfoy turned his face to harry still smilingwell if they were i wouldnt be likely to tell you would i potteroh come on said hermione with a disgusted look at malfoy lets go and find the otherskeep that big bushy head down granger sneered malfoycome on hermione repeated and she pulled harry and ron up the path againill bet you anything his dad is one of that masked lot said ron hotlywell with any luck the ministry will catch him said hermione fervently oh i cant believe this where have the others got tofred george and ginny were nowhere to be seen though the path was packed with plenty of other people all looking nervously over their shoulders toward the commotion back at the campsite a huddle of teenagers in pajamas was arguing vociferously a little way along the path when they saw harry ron and hermione a girl with thick curly hair turned and said quickly oÃ¯Â¿Â½ est madame maxime nous lavons perdue er what said ronoh the girl who had spoken turned her back on him and as they walked on they distinctly heard her say ogwartsbeauxbatons muttered hermionesorry said harrythey must go to beauxbatons said hermione you know beauxbatons academy of magic i read about it in an appraisal ofmagical education in europeoh yeah right said harryfred and george cant have gone that far said ron pulling out his wand lighting it like hermiones and squinting up the path harry dug in the pockets of his jacket for his own wand but it wasnt there the only thing he could find was his omniocularsah no i dont believe it ive lost my wandyoure kiddingron and hermione raised their wands high enough to spread the narrow beams of light farther on the ground harry looked all around him but his wand was nowhere to be seenmaybe its back in the tent said ronmaybe it fell out of your pocket when we were running hermione suggested anxiouslyyeah said harry maybe he usually kept his wand with him at all times in the wizarding world and finding himself without it in the midst of a scene like this made him feel very vulnerablea rustling noise nearby made all three of them jump winky the houseelf was fighting her way out of a clump of bushes nearby she was moving in a most peculiar fashion apparently with great difficulty it was as though someone invisible were trying to hold her backthere is bad wizards about she squeaked distractedly as she leaned forward and labored to keep running people high high in the air winky is getting out of the wayand she disappeared into the trees on the other side of the path panting and squeaking as she fought the force that was restraining herwhats up with her said ron looking curiously after winky why cant she run properlybet she didnt ask permission to hide said harry he was thinking of dobby every time he had tried to do something the malfoys wouldnt like the houseelf had been forced to start beating himself upyou know houseelves get a very raw deal said hermione indignantly its slavery thats what it is that mr crouch made her go up to the top of the stadium and she was terrified and hes got her bewitched so she cant even run when they start trampling tents why doesnt anyone do something about itwell the elves are happy arent they ron said you heard old winky back at the match houseelves is not supposed to have fun thats what she likes being bossed around its people like you ron hermione began hotly who prop up rotten and unjust systems just because theyre too lazy to another loud bang echoed from the edge of the woodlets just keep moving shall we said ron and harry saw him glance edgily at hermione perhaps there was truth in what malfoy had said perhaps hermione was in more danger than they were they set off again harry still searching his pockets even though he knew his wand wasnt therethey followed the dark path deeper into the wood still keeping an eye out for fred george and ginny they passed a group of goblins who were cackling over a sack of gold that they had undoubtedly won betting on the match and who seemed quite unperturbed by the trouble at the campsite farther still along the path they walked into a patch of silvery light and when they looked through the trees they saw three tall and beautiful veela standing in a clearing surrounded by a gaggle of young wizards all of whom were talking very loudlyi pull down about a hundred sacks of galleons a year one of them shouted im a dragon killer for the committee for the disposal of dangerous creaturesno youre not yelled his friend youre a dishwasher at the leaky cauldron but im a vampire hunter ive killed about ninety so far a third young wizard whose pimples were visible even by the dim silvery light of the veela now cut in im about to become the youngest ever minister of magic i amharry snorted with laughter he recognized the pimply wizard his name was stan shunpike and he was in fact a conductor on the tripledecker knight bus he turned to tell ron this but rons face had gone oddly slack and next second ron was yelling did i tell you ive invented a broomstick thatll reach jupiterhonestly said hermione and she and harry grabbed ron firmly by the arms wheeled him around and marched him away by the time the sounds of the veela and their admirers had faded completely they were in the very heart of the wood they seemed to be alone now everything was much quieterharry looked around i reckon we can just wait here you know well hear anyone coming a mile offthe words were hardly out of his mouth when ludo bagman emerged from behind a tree right ahead of themeven by the feeble light of the two wands harry could see that a great change had come over bagman he no longer looked buoyant and rosyfaced there was no more spring in his step he looked very white and strainedwhos that he said blinking down at them trying to make out their faces what are you doing in here all alonethey looked at one another surprisedwell theres a sort of riot going on said ronbagman stared at himwhatat the campsite some people have got hold of a family of muggles bagman swore loudlydamn them he said looking quite distracted and without another word he disapparated with a small popnot exactly on top of things mr bagman is he said hermione frowninghe was a great beater though said ron leading the way off the path into a small clearing and sitting down on a patch of dry grass at the foot of a tree the wimbourne wasps won the league three times in a row while he was with themhe took his small figure of krum out of his pocket set it down on the ground and watched it walk around like the real krum the model was slightly duckfooted and roundshouldered much less impressive on his splayed feet than on his broomstick harry was listening for noise from the campsite everything seemed much quieter perhaps the riot was overi hope the others are okay said hermione after a whiletheyll be fine said ronimagine if your dad catches lucius malfoy said harry sitting down next to ron and watching the small figure of krum slouching over the fallen leaves hes always said hed like to get something on himthatd wipe the smirk off old dracos face all right said ronthose poor muggles though said hermione nervously what if they cant get them downthey will said ron reassuringly theyll find a waymad though to do something like that when the whole ministry of magics out here tonight said hermione i mean how do they expect to get away with it do you think theyve been drinking or are they just but she broke off abruptly and looked over her shoulder harry and ron looked quickly around too it sounded as though someone was staggering toward their clearing they waited listening to the sounds of the uneven steps behind the dark trees but the footsteps came to a sudden halthello called harrythere was silence harry got to his feet and peered around the tree it was too dark to see very far but he could sense somebody standing just beyond the range of his visionwhos there he saidand then without warning the silence was rent by a voice unlike any they had heard in the wood and it uttered not a panicked shout but what sounded like a spellmorsmordreand something vast green and glittering erupted from the patch of darkness harrys eyes had been struggling to penetrate it flew up over the treetops and into the skywhat the gasped ron as he sprang to his feet again staring up at the thing that had appearedfor a split second harry thought it was another leprechaun formation then he realized that it was a colossal skull comprised of what looked like emerald stars with a serpent protruding from its mouth like a tongue as they watched it rose higher and higher blazing in a haze of greenish smoke etched against the black sky like a new constellationsuddenly the wood all around them erupted with screams harry didnt understand why but the only possible cause was the sudden appearance of the skull which had now risen high enough to illuminate the entire wood like some grisly neon sign he scanned the darkness for the person who had conjured the skull but he couldnt see anyonewhos there he called againharry come on move hermione had seized the collar of his jacket and was tugging him backwardwhats the matter harry said startled to see her face so white and terrifiedits the dark mark harry hermione moaned pulling him as hard as she could youknowwhos signvoldemorts harry come onharry turned ron was hurriedly scooping up his miniature krum the three of them started across the clearing but before they had taken a few hurried steps a series of popping noises announced the arrival of twenty wizards appearing from thin air surrounding themharry whirled around and in an instant he registered one fact each of these wizards had his wand out and every wand was pointing right at himself ron and hermionewithout pausing to think he yelled duckhe seized the other two and pulled them down onto the groundstupefy roared twenty voices there was a blinding series of flashes and harry felt the hair on his head ripple as though a powerful wind had swept the clearing raising his head a fraction of an inch he saw jets of fiery red light flying over them from the wizards wands crossing one another bouncing off tree trunks rebounding into the darkness stop yelled a voice he recognized stop thats my son harrys hair stopped blowing about he raised his head a little higher the wizard in front of him had lowered his wand he rolled over and saw mr weasley striding toward them looking terrifiedron harry his voice sounded shaky hermione are you all rightout of the way arthur said a cold curt voiceit was mr crouch he and the other ministry wizards were closing in on them harry got to his feet to face them mr crouchs face was taut with ragewhich of you did it he snapped his sharp eyes darting between them which of you conjured the dark markwe didnt do that said harry gesturing up at the skull we didnt do anything said ron who was rubbing his elbow and looking indignantly at his father what did you want to attack us fordo not lie sir shouted mr crouch his wand was still pointing directly at ron and his eyes were popping he looked slightly mad you have been discovered at the scene of the crimebarty whispered a witch in a long woolen dressing gown theyre kids barty theyd never have been able towhere did the mark come from you three said mr weasley quicklyover there said hermione shakily pointing at the place where they had heard the voice there was someone behind the trees they shouted words an incantation oh stood over there did they said mr crouch turning his popping eyes on hermione now disbelief etched all over his face said an incantation did they you seem very well informed about how that mark is summoned missy but none of the ministry wizards apart from mr crouch seemed to think it remotely likely that harry ron or hermione had conjured the skull on the contrary at hermiones words they had all raised their wands again and were pointing in the direction she had indicated squinting through the dark treeswere too late said the witch in the woolen dressing gown shaking her head theyll have disapparatedi dont think so said a wizard with a scrubby brown beard it was amos diggory cedrics father our stunners went right through those trees theres a good chance we got them amos be careful said a few of the wizards warningly as mr diggory squared his shoulders raised his wand marched across the clearing and disappeared into the darkness hermione watched him vanish with her hands over her moutha few seconds later they heard mr diggory shoutyes we got them theres someone here unconscious its but blimey youve got someone shouted mr crouch sounding highly disbelieving who who is itthey heard snapping twigs the rustling of leaves and then crunching footsteps as mr diggory reemerged from behind the trees he was carrying a tiny limp figure in his arms harry recognized the tea towel at once it was winkymr crouch did not move or speak as mr diggory deposited his elf on the ground at his feet the other ministry wizards were all staring at mr crouch for a few seconds crouch remained transfixed his eyes blazing in his white face as he stared down at winky then he appeared to come to life againthis cannot be he said jerkily no he moved quickly around mr diggory and strode off toward the place where he had found winkyno point mr crouch mr diggory called after him theres no one else therebut mr crouch did not seem prepared to take his word for it they could hear him moving around and the rustling of leaves as he pushed the bushes aside searchingbit embarrassing mr diggory said grimly looking down at winkys unconscious form barty crouchs houseelf i mean to saycome off it amos said mr weasley quietly you dont seriously think it was the elf the dark marks a wizards sign it requires a wandyeah said mr diggory and she had a wandwhat said mr weasleyhere look mr diggory held up a wand and showed it to mr weasley had it in her hand so thats clause three of the code of wand use broken for a start no nonhuman creature is permitted to carry or use a wandjust then there was another pop and ludo bagman apparated right next to mr weasley looking breathless and disorientated he spun on the spot goggling upward at the emeraldgreen skullthe dark mark he panted almost trampling winky as he turned inquiringly to his colleagues who did it did you get them barry whats going onmr crouch had returned emptyhanded his face was still ghostly white and his hands and his toothbrush mustache were both twitchingwhere have you been barty said bagman why werent you at the match your elf was saving you a seat too gulping gargoyles bagman had just noticed winky lying at his feet what happened to heri have been busy ludo said mr crouch still talking in the same jerky fashion barely moving his lips and my elf has been stunnedstunned by you lot you mean but why comprehension dawned suddenly on bagmans round shiny face he looked up at the skull down at winky and then at mr crouchno he said winky conjure the dark mark she wouldnt know how shed need a wand for a startand she had one said mr diggory i found her holding one ludo if its all right with you mr crouch i think we should hear what shes got to say for herselfcrouch gave no sign that he had heard mr diggory but mr diggory seemed to take his silence for assent he raised his own wand pointed it at winky and said ennervatewinky stirred feebly her great brown eyes opened and she blinked several times in a bemused sort of way watched by the silent wizards she raised herself shakily into a sitting positionshe caught sight of mr diggorys feet and slowly tremulously raised her eyes to stare up into his face then more slowly still she looked up into the sky harry could see the floating skull reflected twice in her enormous glassy eyes she gave a gasp looked wildly around the crowded clearing and burst into terrified sobself said mr diggory sternly do you know who i am im a member of the department for the regulation and control of magical creatureswinky began to rock backward and forward on the ground her breath coming in sharp bursts harry was reminded forcibly of dobby in his moments of terrified disobedienceas you see elf the dark mark was conjured here a short while ago said mr diggory and you were discovered moments later right beneath it an explanation if you pleasei i i is not doing it sir winky gasped i is not knowing how siryou were found with a wand in your hand barked mr diggory brandishing it in front of her and as the wand caught the green light that was filling the clearing from the skull above harry recognized ithey thats mine he saideveryone in the clearing looked at himexcuse me said mr diggory incredulouslythats my wand said harry i dropped ityou dropped it repeated mr diggory in disbelief is this a confession you threw it aside after you conjured the markamos think who youre talking to said mr weasley very angrily is harry potter likely to conjure the dark marker of course not mumbled mr diggory sorry carried away i didnt drop it there anyway said harry jerking his thumb toward the trees beneath the skull i missed it right after we got into the woodso said mr diggory his eyes hardening as he turned to look at winky again cowering at his feet you found this wand eh elf and you picked it up and thought youd have some fun with it did youi is not doing magic with it sir squealed winky tears streaming down the sides of her squashed and bulbous nose i is i is i is just picking it up sir i is not making the dark mark sir i is not knowing howit wasnt her said hermione she looked very nervous speaking up in front of all these ministry wizards yet determined all the same winkys got a squeaky little voice and the voice we heard doing the incantation was much deeper she looked around at harry and ron appealing for their support it didnt sound anything like winky did itno said harry shaking his head it definitely didnt sound like an elfyeah it was a human voice said ronwell well soon see growled mr diggory looking unimpressed theres a simple way of discovering the last spell a wand performed elf did you know thatwinky trembled and shook her head frantically her ears flapping as mr diggory raised his own wand again and placed it tip to tip with harrysprior incantato roared mr diggoryharry heard hermione gasp horrified as a gigantic serpenttongued skull erupted from the point where the two wands met but it was a mere shadow of the green skull high above them it looked as though it were made of thick gray smoke the ghost of a spelldeletrius mr diggory shouted and the smoky skull vanished in a wisp of smokeso said mr diggory with a kind of savage triumph looking down upon winky who was still shaking convulsivelyi is not doing it she squealed her eyes rolling in terror i is not i is not i is not knowing how i is a good elf i isnt using wands i isnt knowing howyouve been caught redhanded elf mr diggory roared caught with the guilty wand in your handamos said mr weasley loudly think about it precious few wizards know how to do that spell where would she have learned itperhaps amos is suggesting said mr crouch cold anger in every syllable that i routinely teach my servants to conjure the dark markthere was a deeply unpleasant silence amos diggory looked horrified mr crouch not not at allyou have now come very close to accusing the two people in this clearing who are least likely to conjure that mark barked mr crouch harry potter and myself i suppose you are familiar with the boys story amosof course everyone knows muttered mr diggory looking highly discomfortedand i trust you remember the many proofs i have given over a long career that i despise and detest the dark arts and those who practice them mr crouch shouted his eyes bulging againmr crouch i i never suggested you had anything to do with it amos diggory muttered again now reddening behind his scrubby brown beardif you accuse my elf you accuse me diggory shouted mr crouch where else would she have learned to conjure itshe she mightve picked it up anywhere precisely amos said mr weasley she might have picked it up anywhere winky he said kindly turning to the elf but she flinched as though he too was shouting at her where exactly did you find harrys wandwinky was twisting the hem of her tea towel so violently that it was fraying beneath her fingersi i is finding it finding it there sir she whispered there in the trees siryou see amos said mr weasley whoever conjured the mark could have disapparated right after theyd done it leaving harrys wand behind a clever thing to do not using their own wand which could have betrayed them and winky here had the misfortune to come across the wand moments later and pick it upbut then shed have been only a few feet away from the real culprit said mr diggory impatiently elf did you see anyonewinky began to tremble worse than ever her giant eyes flickered from mr diggory to ludo bagman and onto mr crouch then she gulped and said i is seeing no one sir no one amos said mr crouch curtly i am fully aware that in the ordinary course of events you would want to take winky into your department for questioning i ask you however to allow me to deal with hermr diggory looked as though he didnt think much of this suggestion at all but it was clear to harry that mr crouch was such an important member of the ministry that he did not dare refuse himyou may rest assured that she will be punished mr crouch added coldlymmmaster winky stammered looking up at mr crouch her eyes brimming with tears mmmaster ppplease mr crouch stared back his face somehow sharpened each line upon it more deeply etched there was no pity in his gazewinky has behaved tonight in a manner i would not have believed possible he said slowly i told her to remain in the tent i told her to stay there while i went to sort out the trouble and i find that she disobeyed me this means clothesno shrieked winky prostrating herself at mr crouchs feet no master not clothes not clothesharry knew that the only way to turn a houseelf free was to present it with proper garments it was pitiful to see the way winky clutched at her tea towel as she sobbed over mr crouchs feetbut she was frightened hermione burst out angrily glaring at mr crouch your elfs scared of heights and those wizards in masks were levitating people you cant blame her for wanting to get out of their waymr crouch took a step backward freeing himself from contact with the elf whom he was surveying as though she were something filthy and rotten that was contaminating his overshined shoesi have no use for a houseelf who disobeys me he said coldly looking over at hermione i have no use for a servant who forgets what is due to her master and to her masters reputationwinky was crying so hard that her sobs echoed around the clearing there was a very nasty silence which was ended by mr weasley who said quietly well i think ill take my lot back to the tent if nobodys got any objections amos that wands told us all it can if harry could have it back please mr diggory handed harry his wand and harry pocketed itcome on you three mr weasley said quietly but hermione didnt seem to want to move her eyes were still upon the sobbing elf hermione mr weasley said more urgently she turned and followed harry and ron out of the clearing and off through the treeswhats going to happen to winky said hermione the moment they had left the clearingi dont know said mr weasleythe way they were treating her said hermione furiously mr diggory calling her elf all the time and mr crouch he knows she didnt do it and hes still going to sack her he didnt care how frightened shed been or how upset she was it was like she wasnt even humanwell shes not said ronhermione rounded on himthat doesnt mean she hasnt got feelings ron its disgusting the way hermione i agree with you said mr weasley quickly beckoning her on but now is not the time to discuss elf rights i want to get back to the tent as fast as we can what happened to the otherswe lost them in the dark said ron dad why was everyone so uptight about that skull thingill explain everything back at the tent said mr weasley tenselybut when they reached the edge of the wood their progress was impeded a large crowd of frightenedlooking witches and wizards was congregated there and when they saw mr weasley coming toward them many of them surged forwardwhats going on in therewho conjured itarthur its not himof course its not him said mr weasley impatiently we dont know who it was it looks like they disapparated now excuse me please i want to get to bedhe led harry ron and hermione through the crowd and back into the campsite all was quiet now there was no sign of the masked wizards though several ruined tents were still smokingcharlies head was poking out of the boys tentdad whats going on he called through the dark fred george and ginny got back okay but the others ive got them here said mr weasley bending down and entering the tent harry ron and hermione entered after himbill was sitting at the small kitchen table holding a bedsheet to his arm which was bleeding profusely charlie had a large rip in his shirt and percy was sporting a bloody nose fred george and ginny looked unhurt though shakendid you get them dad said bill sharply the person who conjured the markno said mr weasley we found barry crouchs elf holding harrys wand but were none the wiser about who actually conured the markwhat said bill charlie and percy together harrys wand said fredmr crouchs elf said percy sounding thunderstruckwith some assistance from harry ron and hermione mr weasley explained what had happened in the woods when they had finished their story percy swelled indignantlywell mr crouch is quite right to get rid of an elf like that he said running away when hed expressly told her not to embarrassing him in front of the whole ministry how would that have looked if shed been brought up in front of the department for the regulation and control she didnt do anything she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time hermione snapped at percy who looked very taken aback hermione had always got on fairly well with percy better indeed than any of the othershermione a wizard in mr crouchs position cant afford a houseelf whos going to run amok with a wand said percy pompously recovering himselfshe didnt run amok shouted hermione she just picked it up off the groundlook can someone just explain what that skull thing was said ron impatiently it wasnt hurting anyone whys it such a big deali told you its youknowwhos symbol ron said hermione before anyone else could answer i read about it in the rise and fall of the dark artsand it hasnt been seen for thirteen years said mr weasley quietly of course people panicked it was almost like seeing youknowwho back againi dont get it said ron frowning i mean its still only a shape in the sky ron youknowwho and his followers sent the dark mark into the air whenever they killed said mr weasley the terror it inspired you have no idea youre too young just picture coming home and finding the dark mark hovering over your house and knowing what youre about to find inside mr weasley winced everyones worst fear the very worstthere was silence for a moment then bill removing the sheet from his arm to check on his cut said well it didnt help us tonight whoever conjured it it scared the death eaters away the moment they saw it they all disapparated before wed got near enough to unmask any of them we caught the robertses before they hit the ground though theyre having their memories modified right nowdeath eaters said harry what are death eatersits what youknowwhos supporters called themselves said bill i think we saw whats left of them tonight the ones who managed to keep themselves out of azkaban anywaywe cant prove it was them bill said mr weasley though it probably was he added hopelesslyyeah i bet it was said ron suddenly dad we met draco malfoy in the woods and he as good as told us his dad was one of those nutters in masks and we all know the malfoys were right in with youknowwhobut what were voldemorts supporters harry began everybody flinched like most of the wizarding world the weasleys always avoided saying voldemorts name sorry said harry quickly what were youknowwhos supporters up to levitating muggles i mean what was the pointthe point said mr weasley with a hollow laugh harry thats their idea of fun half the muggle killings back when youknowwho was in power were done for fun i suppose they had a few drinks tonight and couldnt resist reminding us all that lots of them are still at large a nice little reunion for them he finished disgustedlybut if they were the death eaters why did they disapparate when they saw the dark mark said ron theyd have been pleased to see it wouldnt they use your brains ron said bill if they really were death eaters they worked very hard to keep out of azkaban when youknowwho lost power and told all sorts of lies about him forcing them to kill and torture people i bet theyd be even more frightened than the rest of us to see him come back they denied theyd ever been involved with him when he lost his powers and went back to their daily lives i dont reckon hed be overpleased with them do youso whoever conjured the dark mark said hermione slowly were they doing it to show support for the death eaters or to scare them awayyour guess is as good as ours hermione said mr weasley but ill tell you this it was only the death eaters who ever knew how to conjure it id be very surprised if the person who did it hadnt been a death eater once even if theyre not now listen its very late and if your mother hears whats happened shell be worried sick well get a few more hours sleep and then try and get an early portkey out of hereharry got back into his bunk with his head buzzing he knew he ought to feel exhausted it was nearly three in the morning but he felt wideawake wideawake and worriedthree days ago it felt like much longer but it had only been three days he had awoken with his scar burning and tonight for the first time in thirteen years lord voldemorts mark had appeared in the sky what did these things meanhe thought of the letter he had written to sirius before leaving privet drive would sirius have gotten it yet when would he reply harry lay looking up at the canvas but no flying fantasies came to him now to ease him to sleep and it was a long time after charlies snores filled the tent that harry finally dozed offchapter ten mayhem at the ministrymr weasley woke them after only a few hours sleep he used magic to pack up the tents and they left the campsite as quickly as possible passing mr roberts at the door of his cottage mr roberts had a strange dazed look about him and he waved them off with a vague merry christmashell be all right said mr weasley quietly as they marched off onto the moor sometimes when a persons memorys modified it makes him a bit disorientated for a whileand that was a big thing they had to make him forgetthey heard urgent voices as they approached the spot where the portkeys lay and when they reached it they found a great number of witches and wizards gathered around basil the keeper of the portkeys all clamoring to get away from the campsite as quickly as possible mr weasley had a hurried discussion with basil they joined the queue and were able to take an old rubber tire back to stoatshead hill before the sun had really risen they walked back through ottery st catchpole and up the damp lane toward the burrow in the dawn light talking very little because they were so exhausted and thinking longingly of their breakfast as they rounded the corner and the burrow came into view a cry echoed along the laneoh thank goodness thank goodnessmrs weasley who had evidently been waiting for them in the front yard came running toward them still wearing her bedroom slippers her face pale and strained a rolledup copy of the daily prophet clutched in her handarthur ive been so worried so worriedshe flung her arms around mr weasleys neck and the daily prophet fell out of her limp hand onto the ground looking down harry saw the headline scenes of terror at the quidditch world cup complete with a twinkling blackandwhite photograph of the dark mark over the treetops youre all right mrs weasley muttered distractedly releasing mr weasley and staring around at them all with red eyes youre alive oh boys and to everybodys surprise she seized fred and george and pulled them both into such a tight hug that their heads banged togetherouch mum youre strangling us i shouted at you before you left mrs weasley said starting to sob its all ive been thinking about what if youknowwho had got you and the last thing i ever said to you was that you didnt get enough owls oh fred george come on now molly were all perfectly okay said mr weasley soothingly prising her off the twins and leading her back toward the house bill he added in an undertone pick up that paper i want to see what it says when they were all crammed into the tiny kitchen and hermione had made mrs weasley a cup of very strong tea into which mr weasley insisted on pouring a shot of ogdens old firewhiskey bill handed his father the newspaper mr weasley scanned the front page while percy looked over his shoulderi knew it said mr weasley heavily ministry blunders culprits not apprehended lax security dark wizards running unchecked national disgrace who wrote this ah of course rita skeeterthat womans got it in for the ministry of magic said percy furiously last week she was saying were wasting our time quibbling about cauldron thickness when we should be stamping out vampires as if it wasnt specifically stated in paragraph twelve of the guidelines for the treatment of nonwizard parthumans do us a favor perce said bill yawning and shut upim mentioned said mr weasley his eyes widening behind his glasses as he reached the bottom of the daily prophet articlewhere spluttered mrs weasley choking on her tea and whiskey if id seen that id have known you were alivenot by name said mr weasley listen to this if the terrified wizards and witches who waited breathlessly for news at the edge of the wood expected reassurance from the ministry ofmagic they were sadly disappointed a ministry official emerged some time after the appearance of the dark mark alleging that nobody had been hurt but reflising to give any more information whether this statement will be enough to quash the rumors that several bodies were removed from the woods an hour later remains to be seen oh really said mr weasley in exasperation handing the paper to percy nobody was hurt what was i supposed to say rumors that several bodies were removed from the woods well there certainly will be rumors now shes printed thathe heaved a deep sigh molly im going to have to go into the office this is going to take some smoothing overill come with you father said percy importantly mr crouch will need all hands on deck and i can give him my cauldron report in personhe bustled out of the kitchen mrs weasley looked most upset arthur youre supposed to be on holiday this hasnt got anything to do with your office surely they can handle this without youive got to go molly said mr weasley ive made things worse ill just change into my robes and ill be off mrs weasley said harry suddenly unable to contain himself hedwig hasnt arrived with a letter for me has shehedwig dear said mrs weasley distractedly no no there hasnt been any post at allron and hermione looked curiously at harry with a meaningful look at both of them he said all right if i go and dump my stuff in your room ronyeah think i will too said ron at once hermioneyes she said quickly and the three of them marched out of the kitchen and up the stairswhats up harry said ron the moment they had closed the door of the attic room behind themtheres something i havent told you harry said on saturday morning i woke up with my scar hurting againrons and hermiones reactions were almost exactly as harry had imagined them back in his bedroom on privet drive hermione gasped and started making suggestions at once mentioning a number of reference books and everybody from albus dumbledore to madam pomfrey the hogwarts nurse ron simply looked dumbstruckbut he wasnt there was he youknowwho i mean last time your scar kept hurting he was at hogwarts wasnt heim sure he wasnt on privet drive said harry but i was dreaming about him him and peter you know wormtail i cant remember all of it now but they were plotting to killsomeonehe had teetered for a moment on the verge of saying me but couldnt bring himself to make hermione look any more horrified than she already didit was only a dream said ron bracingly just a nightmareyeah but was it though said harry turning to look out of the window at the brightening sky its weird isnt it my scar hurts and three days later the death eaters are on the march and voldemorts signs up in the sky againdont say his name ron hissed through gritted teethand remember what professor trelawney said harry went on ignoring ron at the end of last yearprofessor trelawney was their divination teacher at hogwarts hermiones terrified look vanished as she let out a derisive snortoh harry you arent going to pay attention to anything that old fraud saysyou werent there said harry you didnt hear her this time was different i told you she went into a trance a real one and she said the dark lord would rise again greater and more terrible than ever before and hed manage it because his servant was going to go back to him and that night wormtail escapedthere was a silence in which ron fidgeted absentmindedly with a hole in his chudley cannons bedspreadwhy were you asking if hedwig had come harry hermione asked are you expecting a letteri told sirius about my scar said harry shrugging im waiting for his answergood thinking said ron his expression clearing i bet siriusll know what to doi hoped hed get back to me quickly said harrybut we dont know where sirius is he could be in africa or somewhere couldnt he said hermione reasonably hedwigs not going to manage that journey in a few daysyeah i know said harry but there was a leaden feeling in his stomach as he looked out of the window at the hedwigfree skycome and have a game of quidditch in the orchard harry said ron come on three on three bill and charlie and fred and george will play you can try out the wronski feint ron said hermione in an idontthinkyourebeingverysensitive sort of voice harry doesnt want to play quidditch right now hes worried and hes tired we all need to go to bedyeah i want to play quidditch said harry suddenly hang on ill get my firebolthermione left the room muttering something that sounded very much like boysneither mr weasley nor percy was at home much over the following week both left the house each morning before the rest of the family got up and returned well after dinner every nightits been an absolute uproar percy told them importantly the sunday evening before they were due to return to hogwarts ive been putting out fires all week people keep sending howlers and of course if you dont open a howler straight away it explodes scorch marks all over my desk and my best quill reduced to cinderswhy are they all sending howlers asked ginny who was mending her copy of one thousand magical herbs and fungi with spellotape on the rug in front of the living room firecomplaining about security at the world cup said percy they want compensation for their ruined property mundungus fletchers put in a claim for a twelvebedroomed tent with ensuite jacuzzi but ive got his number i know for a fact he was sleeping under a cloak propped on sticksmrs weasley glanced at the grandfather clock in the corner harry liked this clock it was completely useless if you wanted to know the time but otherwise very informative it had nine golden hands and each of them was engraved with one of the weasley familys names there were no numerals around the face but descriptions of where each family member might be home school and work were there but there was also traveling lost hospital prison and in the position where the number twelve would be on a normal clock mortal perileight of the hands were currently pointing to the home position but mr weasleys which was the longest was still pointing to work mrs weasley sighedyour father hasnt had to go into the office on weekends since the days of youknowwho she said theyre working him far too hard his dinners going to be ruined if he doesnt come home soonwell father feels hes got to make up for his mistake at the match doesnt he said percy if truth be told he was a tad unwise to make a public statement without clearing it with his head of department first dont you dare blame your father for what that wretched skeeter woman wrote said mrs weasley flaring up at onceif dad hadnt said anything old rita would just have said it was disgraceful that nobody from the ministry had commented said bill who was playing chess with ron rita skeeter never makes anyone look good remember she interviewed all the gringotts charm breakers once and called me a longhaired pillockwell it is a bit long dear said mrs weasley gently if youd just let me no mumrain lashed against the living room window hermione was immersed in the standard book of spells grade copies of which mrs weasley had bought for her harry and ron in diagon alley charlie was darning a fireproof balaclava harry was polishing his firebolt the broomstick servicing kit hermione had given him for his thirteenth birthday open at his feet fred and george were sitting in a far corner quills out talking in whispers their heads bent over a piece of parchmentwhat are you two up to said mrs weasley sharply her eyes on the twinshomework

shrewdly you wouldnt be thinking of restarting weasleys wizard wheezes by any chancenow mum said fred looking up at her a pained look on his face if the hogwarts express crashed tomorrow and george and i died how would you feel to know that the last thing we ever heard from you was an unfounded accusationeveryone laughed even mrs weasleyoh your fathers coming she said suddenly looking up at the clock againmr weasleys hand had suddenly spun from work to traveling a second later it had shuddered to a halt on home with the others and they heard him calling from the kitchencoming arthur called mrs weasley hurrying out of the rooma few moments later mr weasley came into the warm living room carrying his dinner on a tray he looked completely exhaustedwell the fats really in the fire now he told mrs weasley as he sat down in an armchair near the hearth and toyed unenthusiastically with his somewhat shriveled cauliflower rita skeeters been ferreting around all week looking for more

agomr crouch has been saying it for weeks and weeks said percy swiftlycrouch is very lucky rita hasnt found out about winky said mr weasley irritably thered be a weeks worth of headlines in his houseelf being caught holding the wand that conjured the dark marki thought we were all agreed that that elf while irresponsible did not conjure the mark said percy hotlyif you ask me mr crouch is very lucky no one at the daily prophet knows how mean he is to elves said hermione angrilynow look here hermione said percy a highranking ministry official like mr crouch deserves unswerving obedience from his servants his slave you mean said hermione her voice rising passionately because he didnt pay winky did hei think youd all better go upstairs and check that youve packed properly said mrs weasley breaking up the argument come on now all of you harry repacked his broomstick servicing kit put his firebolt over his shoulder and went back upstairs with ron the rain sounded even louder at the top of the house accompanied by loud whistlings and moans from the wind not to mention sporadic howls from the ghoul who lived in the attic pigwidgeon began twittering and zooming around his cage when they entered the sight of the halfpacked trunks seemed to have sent him into a frenzy of excitementbung him some owl treats said ron throwing a packet across to harry it might shut him upharry poked a few owl treats through the bars of pigwidgeons cage then turned to his trunk hedwigs cage stood next to it still emptyits been over a week harry said looking at hedwigs deserted perch ron you dont reckon sirius has been caught do younah it wouldve been in the daily prophet said ron the ministry would want to show theyd caught someone wouldnt theyyeah i suppose look heres the stuff mum got for you in diagon alley and shes got some gold out of your vault for you and shes washed all your sockshe heaved a pile of parcels onto harrys camp bed and dropped the money bag and a load of socks next to it harry started unwrapping the shopping apart from the standard book of spells grade by miranda goshawk he had a handful of new quills a dozen rolls of parchment and refills for his potionmaking kit he had been running low on spine of lionfish and essence of belladonna he was just piling underwear into his cauldron when ron made a loud noise of disgust behind himwhat is that supposed to behe was holding up something that looked to harry like a long maroon velvet dress it had a moldylooking lace frill at the collar and matching lace cuffsthere was a knock on the door and mrs weasley entered carrying an armful of freshly laundered hogwarts robeshere you are she said sorting them into two piles now mind you pack them properly so they dont creasemum youve given me ginnys new dress said ron handing it out to herof course i havent said mrs weasley thats for you dress robeswhat said ron looking horrorstruckdress robes repeated mrs weasley it says on your school list that

some for harry too show him harry in some trepidation harry opened the last parcel on his camp bed it wasnt as bad as he had expected however his dress robes didnt have any lace on them at all in fact they were more or less the same as his school ones except that they were bottle green instead of blacki thought theyd bring out the color of your eyes dear said mrs weasley fondlywell theyre okay said ron angrily looking at harrys robes why couldnt i have some like thatbecause well i had to get yours secondhand and there wasnt a lot of choice said mrs weasley flushingharry looked away he would willingly have split all the money in his gringotts vault with the weasleys but he knew they would never take itim never wearing them ron was saying stubbornly neverfine snapped mrs weasley go naked and harry make sure you get a picture of him goodness knows i could do with a laughshe left the room slamming the door behind her there was a funny spluttering noise from behind them pigwidgeon was choking on an overlarge owl treatwhy is everything i own rubbish said ron furiously striding across the room to unstick pigwidgeons beak chapter eleven aboard the hogwart expressthere was a definite endoftheholidays gloom in the air when harry awoke next morning heavy rain was still splattering against the window as he got dressed in jeans and a sweatshirt they would change into their school robes on the hogwarts expresshe ron fred and george had just reached the firstfloor landing on their way down to breakfast when mrs weasley appeared at the foot of the stairs looking harassedarthur she called up the staircase arthur urgent message from the ministryharry flattened himself against the wall as mr weasley came clattering past with his robes on backtofront and hurtled out of sight when harry and the others entered the kitchen they saw mrs weasley rummaging anxiously in the drawers ive got a quill here somewhere and mr weasley bending over the fire talking to harry shut his eyes hard and opened them again to make sure that they were working properlyamos diggorys head was sitting in the middle of the flames like a large bearded egg it was talking very fast completely unperturbed by the sparks flying around it and the flames licking its earsmuggle neighbors heard bangs and shouting so they went and called those whatdyoucallems pleasemen arthur youve got to get over there here said mrs weasley breathlessly pushing a piece of parchment a bottle of ink and a crumpled quill into mr weasleys handsits a real stroke of luck i heard about it said mr diggorys head i had

ambushed by his dustbinswhat did the dustbins do asked mr weasley scribbling franticallymade one hell of a noise and fired rubbish everywhere as far as i can tell said mr diggory apparently one of them was still rocketing around when the pleasemen turned up mr weasley groanedand what about the intruderarthur you know madeye said mr diggorys head rolling its eyes again someone creeping into his

think of his record weve got to get him off on a minor charge something in your department what are exploding dustbins worthmight be a caution said mr weasley still writing very fast his brow furrowed madeye didnt use his wand he didnt actually attack anyoneill bet he leapt out of bed and started jinxing everything he could reach through the window said mr diggory but theyll have a job proving it there arent any casualtiesall right im off mr weasley said and he stuffed the parchment with his notes on it into his pocket and dashed out of the kitchen againmr diggorys head looked around at mrs weasleysorry about this molly it said more calmly bothering you so early and everythingbut arthurs the only one who can get madeye off and madeyes supposed to be starting his new job today why he had to choose last night never mind amos said mrs weasley sure you wont have a bit of toast or anything before you gooh go on then said mr diggorymrs weasley took a piece of buttered toast from a stack on the kitchen table put it into the fire tongs and transferred it into mr diggorys mouthfanks he said in a muffled voice and then with a small pop vanishedharry could hear mr weasley calling hurried goodbyes to bill charlie percy and the girls within five minutes he was back in the kitchen his robes on the right way now dragging a comb through his hairid better hurry you have a good term boys said mr weasley to harry ron and the twins fastening a cloak over his shoulders and preparing to disapparate molly are you going to be all right taking the kids to kings crossof course i will she said

charliedumbledores not what youd call normal though is he said fred i mean i know hes a genius and everything who is madeye asked harryhes retired used to work at the ministry said charlie i met him once when dad took me into work with him he was an auror one of the best a dark wizard catcher he added seeing harrys blank look half the cells in azkaban are full because of him he made himself loads of enemies though the families of people he caught mainly and i heard hes been getting really paranoid in his old age doesnt trust anyone anymore sees dark wizards everywherebill and charlie decided to come and see everyone off at kings cross station but percy apologizing most profusely said that he really needed to get to worki just cant justify taking more time off at the moment he told them mr crouch is really starting to rely on meyeah you know what percy said george seriously i reckon hell know your name soonmrs weasley had braved the telephone in the village post office to order three ordinary muggle taxis to take them into londonarthur tried to borrow ministry cars for us mrs weasley whispered to harry as they stood in the rainwashed yard watching the taxi drivers heaving six heavy hogwarts trunks into their cars but there werent any to spare oh dear they dont look happy do theyharry didnt like to tell mrs weasley that muggle taxi drivers rarely transported overexcited owls and pigwidgeon was making an earsplitting racket nor did it help that a number of filibusters fabulous noheat wetstart fireworks went off unexpectedly when freds trunk sprang open causing the driver carrying it to yell with fright and pain as crookshanks clawed his way up the mans legthe journey was uncomfortable owing to the fact that they were jammed in the back of the taxis with their trunks crookshanks took quite a while to recover from the fireworks and by the time they entered london harry ron and hermione were all severely scratched they were very relieved to get out at kings cross even though the rain was coming down harder than ever and they got soaked carrying their trunks across the busy road and into the stationharry was used to getting onto platform nine and threequarters by now it was a simple matter of walking straight through the apparently solid barrier dividing platforms nine and ten the only tricky part was doing this in an unobtrusive way so as to avoid attracting muggle attention they did it in groups today harry ron and hermione the most conspicuous since they were accompanied by pigwidgeon and crookshanks went first they leaned casually against the barrier chatting unconcernedly and slid sideways through it and as they did so platform nine and threequarters materialized in front of themthe hogwarts express a gleaming scarlet steam engine was already there clouds of steam billowing from it through which the many hogwarts students and parents on the platform appeared like dark ghosts pigwidgeon became noisier than ever in response to the hooting of many owls through the mist harry ron and hermione set off to find seats and were soon stowing their luggage in a compartment halfway along the train they then hopped back down onto the platform to say goodbye to mrs weasley bill and charliei might be seeing you all sooner than you think said charlie grinning as he hugged ginny goodbyewhy said fred keenlyyoull see said charlie just dont tell percy i mentioned it its classified information until such time as the ministry sees fit to release it after allyeah i sort of wish i were back at hogwarts this year said bill hands in his pockets looking almost wistfully at the trainwhy said george impatientlyyoure going to have an interesting year said bill his eyes twinkling i might even get time off to come and watch a bit of ita bit of what said ronbut at that moment the whistle blew and mrs weasley chivvied them toward the train doorsthanks for having us to stay mrs weasley said hermione as they climbed on board closed the door and leaned out of the window to talk to heryeah thanks for everything mrs weasley said harryoh it was my pleasure dears said mrs weasley id invite you for christmas butwell i expect youre all going to want to stay at hogwarts what with one thing and anothermum said ron irritably what dyou three know that we dontyoull find out this evening i expect said mrs weasley smiling its going to be very exciting mind you im very glad theyve changed the rules what rules said harry ron fred and george together im sure professor dumbledore will tell you now behave wont you wont you fred and you georgethe pistons hissed loudly and the train began to movetell us whats happening at hogwarts fred bellowed out of the window as mrs weasley bill and charlie sped away from them what rules are they changingbut mrs weasley only smiled and waved before the train had rounded the corner she bill and charlie had disapparatedharry ron and hermione went back to their compartment the thick rain splattering the windows made it very difficult to see out of them ron undid his trunk pulled out his maroon dress robes and flung them over pigwidgeons cage to muffle his hootingbagman wanted to tell us whats happening at hogwarts he said grumpily sitting down next to harry at the world cup remember but my own mother wont say wonder what shh hermione whispered suddenly pressing her finger to her lips and pointing toward the compartment next to theirs harry and ron listened and heard a familiar drawling voice drifting in through the open doorfather actually considered sending me to durmstrang rather than hogwarts you know he knows the headmaster you see well you know his opinion of dumbledore the mans such a mudbloodlover and durmstrang doesnt admit that sort of riffraff but mother didnt like the idea of me going to school so far away father says durmstrang takes a far more sensible line than hogwarts about the dark arts durmstrang students actually learn them not just the defense rubbish we do hermione got up tiptoed to the compartment door and slid it shut blocking out malfoys voiceso he thinks durmstrang would have suited him does he she said angrily i wish he had gone then we wouldnt have to put up with himdurmstrangs another wizarding school said harryyes said hermione sniffily and its got a horrible reputation according to an appraisal ofmagical education in europe it puts a lot of emphasis on the dark artsi think ive heard of it said ron vaguely where is it what countrywell nobody knows do they said hermione raising her eyebrowser why not said harrytheres traditionally been a lot of rivalry between all the magic schools durmstrang and beauxbatons like to conceal their whereabouts so nobody can steal their secrets said hermione matteroffactlycome off it said ron starting to laugh durmstrangs got to be about the same size as hogwarts how are you going to hide a great big castlebut hogwarts is hidden said hermione in surprise everyone knows that well everyone whos read hogwarts a history anywayjust you then said ron so go on how dyou hide a place like hogwartsits bewitched said hermione if a muggle looks at it all they see is a moldering old ruin with a sign over the entrance saying danger do not enter unsafeso durmstrangll just look like a ruin to an outsider toomaybe said hermione shrugging or it might have mugglerepelling charms on it like the world cup stadium and to keep foreign wizards from finding it theyll have made it unplottable come againwell you can enchant a building so its impossible to plot on a map cant youer if you say so said harrybut i think durmstrang must be somewhere in the far north said hermione thoughtfully somewhere very cold because theyve got fur capes as part of their uniformsah think of the possibilities said ron dreamily it wouldve been so easy to push malfoy off a glacier and make it look like an accident shame his mother likes him the rain became heavier and heavier as the train moved farther north the sky was so dark and the windows so steamy that the lanterns were lit by midday the lunch trolley came rattling along the corridor and harry bought a large stack of cauldron cakes for them to shareseveral of their friends looked in on them as the afternoon progressed including seamus finnigan dean thomas and neville longbottom a roundfaced extremely forgetful boy who had been brought up by his formidable witch of a grandmother seamus was still wearing his ireland rosette some of its magic seemed to be wearing off now it was still squeaking troy mullet moran but in a very feeble and exhausted sort of way after half an hour or so hermione growing tired of the endless quidditch talk buried herself once more in the standard book of spells grade and started trying to learn a summoning charmneville listened jealously to the others conversation as they relived the cup matchgran didnt want to go he said miserably wouldnt buy tickets it sounded amazing thoughit was said ron look at this neville he rummaged in his trunk up in the luggage rack and pulled out the miniature figure of viktor krumoh wow said neville enviously as ron tipped krum onto his pudgy handwe saw him right up close as well said ron we were in the top box for the first and last time in your life weasleydraco malfoy had appeared in the doorway behind him stood crabbe and goyle his enormous thuggish cronies both of whom appeared to have grown at least a foot during the summer evidently they had overheard the conversation through the compartment door which dean and seamus had left ajardont remember asking you to join us malfoy said harry coollyweasley what is that said malfoy pointing at pigwidgeons cage a sleeve of rons dress robes was dangling from it swaying with the motion of the train the moldy lace cuff very obviousron made to stuff the robes out of sight but malfoy was too quick for him he seized the sleeve and pulledlook at this said malfoy in ecstasy holding up rons robes and showing crabbe and goyle weasley you werent thinking of wearing these were you i mean they were very fashionable in about eighteen ninety eat dung malfoy said ron the same color as the dress robes as he snatched them back out of malfoys grip malfoy howled with derisive laughter crabbe and goyle guffawed stupidlyso going to enter weasley going to try and bring a bit of glory to the family name theres money involved as well you know youd be able to afford some decent robes if you won what are you talking about snapped ronare you going to enter malfoy repeated i suppose you will potter you never miss a chance to show off do youeither explain what youre on about or go away malfoy said hermione testily over the top of the standard book of spells grade a gleeful smile spread across malfoys pale facedont tell me you dont know he said delightedly youve got a father and brother at the ministry and you dont even know my god my father told me about it ages ago heard it from cornelius fudge but then fathers always associated with the top people at the ministry maybe your fathers too junior to know about it weasley yes they probably dont talk about important stuff in front of him laughing once more malfoy beckoned to crabbe and goyle and the three of them disappearedron got to his feet and slammed the sliding compartment door so hard behind them that the glass shatteredron said hermione reproachfully and she pulled out her wand muttered reparo and the glass shards flew back into a single pane and back into the doorwell making it look like he knows everything and we dont ron snarled fathers always associated with the top peopie at the ministry dad couldve got a promotion any time he just likes it where he is of course he does said hermione quietly dont let malfoy get to you ron him get to me as if said ron picking up one of the remaining cauldron cakes and squashing it into a pulprons bad mood continued for the rest of the journey he didnt talk much as they changed into their school robes and was still glowering when the hogwarts express slowed down at last and finally stopped in the pitchdarkness of hogsmeade stationas the train doors opened there was a rumble of thunder overhead hermione bundled up crookshanks in her cloak and ron left his dress robes over pigwidgeon as they left the train heads bent and eyes narrowed against the downpour the rain was now coming down so thick and fast that it was as though buckets of icecold water were being emptied repeatedly over their headshi hagrid harry yelled seeing a gigantic silhouette at the far end of the platformall righ harry hagrid bellowed back waving see yeh at the feast if we don drownfirst years traditionally reached hogwarts castle by sailing across the lake with hagridoooh i wouldnt fancy crossing the lake in this weather said hermione fervently shivering as they inched slowly along the dark platform with the rest of the crowd a hundred horseless carriages stood waiting for them outside the station harry ron hermione and neville climbed gratefully into one of them the door shut with a snap and a few moments later with a great lurch the long procession of carriages was rumbling and splashing its way up the track toward hogwarts castlechapter twelve the triwizard tournamentthrough the gates flanked with statues of winged boars and up the sweeping drive the carriages trundled swaying dangerously in what was fast becoming a gale leaning against the window harry could see hogwarts coming nearer its many lighted windows blurred and shimmering behind the thick curtain of rain lightning flashed across the sky as their carriage came to a halt before the great oak front doors which stood at the top of a flight of stone steps people who had occupied the carriages in front were already hurrying up the stone steps into the castle harry ron hermione and neville jumped down from their carriage and dashed up the steps too looking up only when they were safely inside the cavernous torchlit entrance hall with its magnificent marble staircaseblimey said ron shaking his head and sending water everywhere if that keeps up the lakes going to overflow im soak arrgha large red waterfilled balloon had dropped from out of the ceiling onto rons head and exploded drenched and sputtering ron staggered sideways into harry just as a second water bomb dropped narrowly missing hermione it burst at harrys feet sending a wave of cold water over his sneakers into his socks people all around them shrieked and started pushing one another in their efforts to get out of the line of fire harry looked up and saw floating twenty feet above them peeves the poltergeist a little man in a bellcovered hat and orange bow tie his wide malicious face contorted with concentration as he took aim againpeeves yelled an angry voice peeves come down here at onceprofessor mcgonagall deputy headmistress and head of gryffindor house had come dashing out of the great hall she skidded on the wet floor and grabbed hermione around the neck to stop herself from fallingouch sorry miss granger thats all right professor hermione gasped massaging her throatpeeves get down here now barked professor mcgonagall straightening her pointed hat and glaring upward through her squarerimmed spectaclesnot doing nothing cackled peeves lobbing a water bomb at several fifthyear girls who screamed and dived into the great hall already wet arent they little squirts wheeeeeeeeee and he aimed another bomb at a group of second years who had just arrivedi shall call the headmaster shouted professor mcgonagall im warning you peeves peeves stuck out his tongue threw the last of his water bombs into the air and zoomed off up the marble staircase cackling insanelywell move along then said professor mcgonagall sharply to the bedraggled crowd into the great hall come onharry ron and hermione slipped and slid across the entrance hall and through the double doors on the right ron muttering furiously under his breath as he pushed his sopping hair off his facethe great hall looked its usual splendid self decorated for the startofterm feast golden plates and goblets gleamed by the light of hundreds and hundreds of candles floating over the tables in midair the four long house tables were packed with chattering students at the top of the hall the staff sat along one side of a fifth table facing their pupils it was much warmer in here harry ron and hermione walked past the slytherins the ravenclaws and the hufflepuffs and sat down with the rest of the gryffindors at the far side of the hall next to nearly headless nick the gryffindor ghost pearly white and semitransparent nick was dressed tonight in his usual doublet but with a particularly large ruff which served the dual purpose of looking extrafestive and insuring that his head didnt wobble too much on his partially severed neckgood evening he said beaming at themsays who said harry taking off his sneakers and emptying them of water hope they hurry up with the sorting im starvingthe sorting of the new students into houses took place at the start of every school year but by an unlucky combination of circumstances harry hadnt been present at one since his own he was quite looking forward to it just then a highly excited breathless voice called down the tablehiya harryit was colin creevey a third year to whom harry was something of a herohi colin said harry warilyharry guess what guess what harry my brothers starting my brother denniser good said harryhes really excited said colin practically bouncing up and down in his seat i just hope hes in gryffindor keep your fingers crossed eh harryer yeah all right said harry he turned back to hermione ron and nearly headless nick brothers and sisters usually go in the same houses dont they he said he was judging by the weasleys all seven of whom had been put into gryffindoroh no not necessarily said hermione parvati patils twins in ravenclaw and theyre identical youd think theyd be together wouldnt youharry looked up at the staff table there seemed to be rather more empty seats there than usual hagrid of course was still fighting his way across the lake with the first years professor mcgonagall was presumably supervising the drying of the entrance hall floor but there was another empty chair too and harry couldnt think who else was missingwheres the new defense against the dark arts teacher said hermione who was also looking up at the teachersthey had never yet had a defense against the dark arts teacher who had lasted more than three terms harrys favorite by far had been professor lupin who had resigned last year he looked up and down the staff table there was definitely no new face theremaybe they couldnt get anyone said hermione looking anxiousharry scanned the table more carefully tiny little professor flitwick the charms teacher was sitting on a large pile of cushions beside professor sprout the herbology teacher whose hat was askew over her flyaway gray hair she was talking to professor sinistra of the astronomy department on professor sinistras other side was the sallowfaced hooknosed greasyhaired potions master snape harrys least favorite person at hogwarts harrys loathing of snape was matched only by snapes hatred of him a hatred which had if possible intensified last year when harry had helped sirius escape right under snapes overlarge nose snape and sirius had been enemies since their own school dayson snapes other side was an empty seat which harry guessed was professor mcgonagalls next to it and in the very center of the table sat professor dumbledore the headmaster his sweeping silver hair and beard shining in the candlelight his magnificent deep green robes embroidered with many stars and moons the tips of dumbledores long thin fingers were together and he was resting his chin upon them staring up at the ceiling through his halfmoon spectacles as though lost in thought harry glanced up at the ceiling too it was enchanted to look like the sky outside and he had never seen it look this stormy black and purple clouds were swirling across it and as another thunderclap sounded outside a fork of lightning flashed across itoh hurry up ron moaned beside harry i could eat a hippogriffthe words were no sooner out of his mouth than the doors of the great hall opened and silence fell professor mcgonagall was leading a long line of first years up to the top of the hall if harry ron and hermione were wet it was nothing to how these first years looked they appeared to have swum across the lake rather than sailed all of them were shivering with a combination of cold and nerves as they filed along the staff table and came to a halt in a line facing the rest of the school all of them except the smallest of the lot a boy with mousy hair who was wrapped in what harry recognized as hagrids moleskin overcoat the coat was so big for him that it hooked as though he were draped in a furry black circus tent his small face protruded from over the collar looking almost painfully excited when he had lined up with his terrifiedlooking peers he caught colin creeveys eye gave a double thumbsup and mouthed i fell in the lake he looked positively delighted about itprofessor mcgonagall now placed a threelegged stool on the ground before the first years and on top of it an extremely old dirty patched wizards hat the first years stared at it so did everyone else for a moment there was silence then a long tear near the brim opened wide like a mouth and the hat broke into songa thousand years or more agowhen i was newly sewnthere lived four wizards of renownwhose names are still well knownbold gryffindor from wild moorfair ravenclaw from glensweet hufflepuff from

look inside your mindand tell where you belongthe great hall rang with applause as the sorting hat finishedthats not the song it sang when it sorted us said harry clapping along with everyone elsesings a different one every year said ron its got to be a pretty boring life hasnt it being a hat i suppose it spends all year making up the next oneprofessor mcgonagall was now unrolling a large scroll of parchmentwhen i call out your name you will put on the hat and sit on the stool she told the first years when the hat announces your house you will go and sit at the appropriate tableackerley stewarta boy walked forward visibly trembling from head to foot picked up the sorting hat put it on and sat down on the stoolravenclaw shouted the hatstewart ackerley took off the hat and hurried into a seat at the ravenclaw table where everyone was applauding him harry caught a glimpse of cho the ravenclaw seeker cheering stewart ackerley as he sat down for a fleeting second harry had a strange desire to join the ravenclaw table toobaddock malcolmslytherinthe table on the other side of the hall erupted with cheers harry could see malfoy clapping as baddock joined the slytherins harry wondered whether baddock knew that slytherin house had turned out more dark witches and wizards than any other fred and george hissed malcolm baddock as he sat downbranstone eleanorhufflepuffcauldwell owenhufflepuffcreevey dennistiny dennis creevey staggered forward tripping over hagrids moleskin just as hagrid himself sidled into the hall through a door behind the teachers table about twice as tall as a normal man and at least three times as broad hagrid with his long wild tangled black hair and beard looked slightly alarming a misleading impression for harry ron and hermione knew hagrid to possess a very kind nature he winked at them as he sat down at the end of the staff table and watched dennis creevey putting on the sorting hat the rip at the brim opened wide gryffindor the hat shoutedhagrid clapped along with the gryffindors as dennis creevey beaming widely took off the hat placed it back on the stool and hurried over to join his brothercolin i fell in he said shrilly throwing himself into an empty seat it was brilliant and something in the water grabbed me and pushed me back in the boatcool said colin just as excitedly it was probably the giant squid denniswow said dennis as though nobody in their wildest dreams could hope for more than being thrown into a stormtossed fathomsdeep lake and pushed out of it again by a giant sea monsterdennis dennis see that boy down there the one with the black hair and glasses see him know who he is dennisharry looked away staring very hard at the sorting hat now sorting emma dobbsthe sorting continued boys and girls with varying degrees of fright on their faces moving one by one to the threelegged stool the line dwindling slowly as professor mcgonagall passed the lsoh hurry up ron moaned massaging his stomach now ron the sortings much more important than food said nearly headless nick as madley laura became a hufflepuffcourse it is if youre dead snapped roni do hope this years batch of gryffindors are up to scratch said nearly headless nick applauding as mcdonald natalie joined the gryffindor table we dont want to break our winning streak do wegryffindor had won the interhouse championship for the last three years in a rowpritchard grahamslytherinquirke orlaravenclawand finally with whitby kevin hufflepuff the sorting ended professor mcgonagall picked up the hat and the stool and carried them awayabout time said ron seizing his knife and fork and looking expectantly at his golden plateprofessor dumbledore had gotten to his feet he was smiling around at the students his arms opened wide in welcomei have only two words to say to you he told them his deep voice echoing around the hall tuck inhear hear said harry and ron loudly as the empty dishes filled magically before their eyesnearly headless nick watched mournfully as harry ron and hermione loaded their own platesaaah ats beer said ron with his mouth full of mashed potatoyoure lucky theres a feast at all tonight you know said nearly headless nick there was trouble in the kitchens earlierwhy wha appened said harry through a sizable chunk of steakpeeves of course said nearly headless nick shaking his head which wobbled dangerously he pulled his ruff a little higher up on his neck the usual argument you know he wanted to attend the feast well its quite out of the question you know what hes like utterly uncivilized cant see a plate of food without throwing it we held a ghosts council the fat friar was all for giving him the chance but most wisely in my opinion the bloody baron put his foot downthe bloody baron was the slytherin ghost a gaunt and silent specter covered in silver bloodstains he was the only person at hogwarts who could really control peevesyeah we thought peeves seemed hacked off about something said ron darkly so what did he do in the kitchensoh the usual said nearly headless nick shrugging wreaked havoc and mayhem pots and pans everywhere place swimming in soup terrified the houseelves out of their witsclanghermione had knocked over her golden goblet pumpkin juice spread steadily over the tablecloth staining several feet of white linen orange but hermione paid no attentionthere are houseelves here she said staring horrorstruck at nearly headless nick here at hogwartscertainly said nearly headless nick looking surprised at her reaction the

they get paid she said they get holidays dont they and and sick leave and pensions and everythingnearly headless nick chortled so much that his ruff slipped and his head flopped off dangling on the inch or so of ghostly skin and muscle that still attached it to his necksick leave and pensions he said pushing his head back onto his shoulders and securing it once more with his ruff houseelves dont want sick leave and pensionshermione looked down at her hardly touched plate of food then put her knife and fork down upon it and pushed it away from heroh cmon ermyknee said ron accidentally spraying harry with bits of yorkshire pudding oops sorry arry he swallowed you wont get them sick leave by starving yourselfslave labor said hermione breathing hard through her nose thats what made this dinner slave laborand she refused to eat another bitethe rain was still drumming heavily against the high dark glass another clap of thunder shook the windows and the stormy ceiling flashed illuminating the golden plates as the remains of the first course vanished and were replaced instantly with puddingstreacle tart hermione said ron deliberately wafting its smell toward her spotted dick look chocolate gateaubut hermione gave him a look so reminiscent of professor mcgonagall that he gave upwhen the puddings too had been demolished and the last crumbs had faded off the plates leaving them sparkling clean albus dumbledore got to his feet again the buzz of chatter filling the hall ceased almost at once so that only the howling wind and pounding rain could be heardso said dumbledore smiling around at them all now that we are all fed and watered hmph said hermione i must once more ask for your attention while i give out a few noticesmr filch the caretaker has asked me to tell you that the list of objects forbidden inside the castle has this year been extended to include screaming yoyos fanged frisbees and everbashing boomerangs the full list comprises some four hundred and thirtyseven items i believe and can be viewed in mr filchs office if anybody would like to check itthe corners of dumbledores mouth twitched he continued as ever i would like to remind you all that the forest on the grounds is outofbounds to students as is the village of hogsmeade to all below third yearit is also my painful duty to inform you that the interhouse quidditch cup will not take place this yearwhat harry gasped he looked around at fred and george his fellow members of the quidditch team they were mouthing soundlessly at dumbledore apparently too appalled to speak dumbhedore went on this is due to an event that will be starting in october and continuing throughout the school year taking up much of the teachers time and energy but i am sure you will all enjoy it immensely i have great pleasure in announcing that this year at hogwarts but at that moment there was a deafening rumble of thunder and the doors of the great hall banged opena man stood in the doorway leaning upon a long staff shrouded in a black traveling cloak every head in the great hall swiveled toward the stranger suddenly brightly illuminated by a fork of lightning that flashed across the ceiling he lowered his hood shook out a long mane of grizzled dark gray hair then began to walk up toward the teachers tablea dull clunk echoed through the hall on his every other step he reached the end of the top table turned right and limped heavily toward dumbledore another flash of lightning crossed the ceiling hermione gaspedthe lightning had thrown the mans face into sharp relief and it was a face unlike any harry had ever seen it looked as though it had been carved out of weathered wood by someone who had only the vaguest idea of what human faces are supposed to look like and was none too skilled with a chisel every inch of skin seemed to be scarred the mouth looked like a diagonal gash and a large chunk of the nose was missing but it was the mans eyes that made him frighteningone of them was small dark and beady the other was large round as a coin and a vivid electric blue the blue eye was moving ceaselessly without blinking and was rolling up down and from side to side quite independently of the normal eye and then it rolled right over pointing into the back of the mans head so that all they could see was whitenessthe stranger reached dumbledore he stretched out a hand that was as badly scarred as his face and dumbhedore shook it muttering words harry couldnt hear he seemed to be making some inquiry of the stranger who shook his head unsmilingly and replied in an undertone dumbledore nodded and gestured the man to the empty seat on his righthand sidethe stranger sat down shook his mane of dark gray hair out of his face pulled a plate of sausages toward him raised it to what was left of his nose and sniffed it he then took a small knife out of his pocket speared a sausage on the end of it and began to eat his normal eye was fixed upon the sausages but the blue eye was still darting restlessly around in its socket taking in the hall and the studentsmay i introduce our new defense against the dark arts teacher said dumbledore brightly into the silence professor moodyit was usual for new staff members to be greeted with applause but none of the staff or students chapped except dumbledore and hagrid who both put their hands together and applauded but the sound echoed dismally into the silence and they stopped fairly quickly everyone else seemed too transfixed by moodys bizarre appearance to do more than stare at himmoody harry muttered to ron madeye moody the one your dad went to help this morningmust be said ron in a low awed voicewhat happened to him hermione whispered what happened to his facedunno ron whispered back watching moody with fascinationmoody seemed totally indifferent to his lessthanwarm welcome ignoring the jug of pumpkin juice in front of him he reached again into his traveling cloak pulled out a hip flask and took a long draught from it as he lifted his arm to drink his cloak was pulled a few inches from the ground and harry saw below the table several inches of carved wooden leg ending in a clawed footdumbledore cleared his throatas i was saying he said smiling at the sea of students before him all of whom were still gazing transfixed at madeye moody we are to have the honor of hosting a very exciting event over the coming months an event that has not been held for over a century it is my very great pleasure to inform you that the triwizard tournament will be taking place at hogwarts this yearyoure joking said fred weasley loudlythe tension that had filled the hall ever since moodys arrival suddenly broke nearly everyone laughed and dumbledore chuckled appreciativelyi am not joking mr weasley he said though now that you mention it i did hear an excellent one over the summer about a troll a hag and a leprechaun who all go into a bar professor mcgonagall cleared her throat loudlyer but maybe this is not the time no said dumbledore where was i ah yes the triwizard tournament well some of you will not know what this tournament involves so i hope those who do know will forgive me for giving a short explanation and allow their attention to wander freelythe triwizard tournament was first established some seven hundred years ago as a friendly competition between the three largest european schools of wizardry hogwarts beauxbatons and durmstrang a champion was selected to represent each school and the three champions competed in three magical tasks the schools took it in turns to host the tournament once every five years and it was generally agreed to be a most excellent way of establishing ties between young witches and wizards of different nationalities until that is the death toll mounted so high that the tournament was discontinueddeath toll hermione whispered looking alarmed but her anxiety did not seem to be shared by the majority of students in the hall many of them were whispering excitedly to one another and harry himself was far more interested in hearing about the tournament than in worrying about deaths that had happened hundreds of years agothere have been several attempts over the centuries to reinstate the tournament dumbledore continued none of which has been very successful however our own departments of international magical cooperation and magical games and sports have decided the time is ripe for another attempt we have worked hard over the summer to ensure that this time no champion will find himself or herself in mortal dangerthe heads of beauxbatons and durmstrang will be arriving with their shortlisted contenders in october and the selection of the three champions will take place at halloween an impartial judge will decide which students are most worthy to compete for the triwizard cup the glory of their school and a thousand galleons personal prize moneyim going for it fred weasley hissed down the table his face lit with enthusiasm at the prospect of such glory and riches he was not the only person who seemed to be visualizing himself as the hogwarts champion at every house table harry could see people either gazing raptly at dumbledore or else whispering fervently to their neighbors but then dumbledore spoke again and the hall quieted once moreeager though i know all of you will be to bring the triwizard cup to hogwarts he said the heads of the participating schools along with the ministry of magic have agreed to impose an age restriction on contenders this year only students who are of age that is to say seventeen years or older will be allowed to put forward their names for consideration this dumbledore raised his voice slightly for several people had made noises of outrage at these words and the weasley twins were suddenly looking furious is a measure we feel is necessary given that the tournament tasks will still be difficult and dangerous whatever precautions we take and it is highly unlikely that students below sixth and seventh year will be able to cope with them i will personally be ensuring that no underage student hoodwinks our impartial judge into making them hogwarts champion his light blue eyes twinkled as they flickered over freds and georges mutinous faces i therefore beg you not to waste your time submitting yourself if you are under seventeenthe delegations from beauxbatons and durmstrang will be arriving in october and remaining with us for the greater part of this year i know that you will all extend every courtesy to our foreign guests while they are with us and will give your wholehearted support to the hogwarts champion when he or she is selected and now it is late and i know how important it is to you all to be alert and rested as you enter your lessons tomorrow morning bedtime chop chopdumbledore sat down again and turned to talk to madeye moody there was a great scraping and banging as all the students got to their feet and swarmed toward the double doors into the entrance hallthey cant do that said george weasley who had not joined the crowd moving toward the door but was standing up and glaring at dumbledore were seventeen in april why cant we have a shot theyre not stopping me entering said fred stubbornly also scowling at the top table the championsll get to do all sorts of stuff youd never be allowed to do normally and a thousand galleons prize moneyyeah said ron a faraway look on his face yeah a thousand galleons come on said hermione well be the only ones left here if you dont moveharry ron hermione fred and george set off for the entrance hall fred and george debating the ways in which dumbledore might stop those who were under seventeen from entering the tournamentwhos this impartial judge whos going to decide who the champions are said harrydunno said fred but its them well have to fool i reckon a couple of drops of aging potion might do it george dumbledore knows youre not of age though said ronyeah but hes not the one who decides who the champion is is he said fred shrewdly sounds to me like once this judge knows who wants to enter hell choose the best from each school and never mind how old they are dumbledores trying to stop us giving our namespeople have died though said hermione in a worried voice as they walked through a door concealed behind a tapestry and started up another narrower staircaseyeah said fred airily but that was years ago wasnt it anyway wheres the fun without a bit of risk hey ron what if we find out how to get round dumbledore fancy enteringwhat dyou reckon ron asked harry be cool to enter wouldnt it but i spose they might want someone older dunno if weve learned enough i definitely havent came nevihles gloomy voice from behind fred and georgei expect my grand want me to try though shes always going on about how i should be upholding the family honor ill just have to oops nevilles foot had sunk right through a step halfway up the staircase there were many of these trick stairs at hogwarts it was second nature to most of the older students to jump this particular step but nevilles memory was notoriously poor harry and ron seized him under the armpits and pulled him out while a suit of armor at the top of the stairs creaked and clanked laughing wheezilyshut it you said ron banging down its visor as they passed they made their way up to the entrance to gryffindor tower which was concealed behind a large portrait of a fat lady in a pink silk dresspassword she said as they approachedbalderdash said george a prefect downstairs told methe portrait swung forward to reveal a hole in the wall through which they all climbed a crackling fire warmed the circular common room which was full of squashy armchairs and tables hermione cast the merrily dancing flames a dark look and harry distinctly heard her mutter slave labor before bidding them good night and disappearing through the doorway to the girls dormitoryharry ron and neville climbed up the last spiral staircase until they reached their own dormitory which was situated at the top of the tower five fourposter beds with deep crimson hangings stood against the walls each with its owners trunk at the foot dean and seamus were already getting into bed seamus had pinned his ireland rosette to his headboard and dean had tacked up a poster of viktor krum over his bedside table his old poster of the west ham football team was pinned right next to itmental ron sighed shaking his head at the completely stationary soccer playersharry ron and neville got into their pajamas and into bed someone a houseelf no doubt had placed warming pans between the sheets it was extremely comfortable lying there in bed and listening to the storm raging outsidei might go in for it you know ron said sleepily through the darkness if fred and george find out how to the tournament you never know do youspose not harry rolled over in bed a series of dazzling new pictures forming in his minds eye he had hoodwinked the impartial judge into believing he was seventeen he had become hogwarts champion he was standing on the grounds his arms raised in triumph in front of the whole school all of whom were applauding and screaming he had just won the triwizard tournament chos face stood out particularly clearly in the blurred crowd her face glowing with admirationharry grinned into his pillow exceptionally glad that ron couldnt see what he could chapter thirteen madeye moodythe storm had blown itself out by the following morning though the ceiling in the great hall was still gloomy heavy clouds of pewter gray swirled overhead as harry ron and hermione examined their new course schedules at breakfast a few seats along fred george and lee jordan were discussing magical methods of aging themselves and bluffing their way into the triwizard tournamenttodays not bad outside all morning said ron who was running his finger down the monday column of his schedule herbology with the hufflepuffs and care of magical creatures damn it were still with the slytherins double divination this afternoon harry groaned looking down divination was his least favorite subject apart from potions professor trelawney kept predicting harrys death which he found extremely annoyingyou should have given it up like me shouldnt you said hermione briskly buttering herself some toast then youd be doing something sensible like arithmancyyoure eating again i notice said ron watching hermione adding liberal amounts of jam to her toast tooive decided there are better ways of making a stand about elf rights said hermione haughtilyyeah and you were hungry said ron grinningthere was a sudden rustling noise above them and a hundred owls came soaring through the open windows carrying the morning mail instinctively harry looked up but there was no sign of white among the mass of brown and gray the owls circled the tables looking for the people to whom their letters and packages were addressed a large tawny owl soared down to neville longbottom and deposited a parcel into his lap neville almost always forgot to pack something on the other side of the hall draco malfoys eagle owl had landed on his shoulder carrying what looked like his usual supply of sweets and cakes from home trying to ignore the sinking feeling of disappointment in his stomach harry returned to his porridge was it possible that something had happened to hedwig and that sirius hadnt even got his letterhis preoccupation lasted all the way across the sodden vegetable patch until they arrived in greenhouse three but here he was distracted by professor sprout showing the class the ugliest plants harry had ever seen indeed they looked less like plants than thick black giant slugs protruding vertically out of the soil each was squirming slightly and had a number of large shiny swellings upon it which appeared to be full of liquidbubotubers professor sprout told them briskly they need squeezing you will collect the pus the what said seamus finnigan sounding revoltedpus finnigan pus said professor sprout and its extremely valuable so dont waste it you will collect the pus i say in these bottles wear your dragonhide gloves it can do funny things to the skin when undiluted bubotuber pussqueezing the bubotubers was disgusting but oddly satisfying as each swelling was popped a large amount of thick yellowishgreen liquid burst forth which smelled strongly of petrol they caught it in the bottles as professor sprout had indicated and by the end of the lesson had collected several pintsthisll keep madam pomfrey happy said professor sprout stoppering the last bottle with a cork an excellent remedy for the more stubborn forms of acne bubotuber pus should stop students resorting to desperate measures to rid themselves of pimpleslike poor eloise midgen said hannah abbott a hufflepuff in a hushed voice she tried to curse hers offsilly girl said professor sprout shaking her head but madam pomfrey fixed her nose back on in the enda booming bell echoed from the castle across the wet grounds signaling the end of the lesson and the class separated the hufflepuffs climbing the stone steps for transfiguration and the gryffindors heading in the other direction down the sloping lawn toward hagrids small wooden cabin which stood on the edge of the forbidden foresthagrid was standing outside his hut one hand on the collar of his enormous black boarhound fang there were several open wooden crates on the ground at his feet and fang was whimpering and straining at his collar apparently keen to investigate the contents more closely as they drew nearer an odd rattling noise reached their ears punctuated by what sounded like minor explosionsmornin hagrid said grinning at harry ron and hermione beer wait fer the slytherins they won want ter miss this blastended skrewtscome again said ronhagrid pointed down into the crateseurgh squealed lavender brown jumping backward eurgh just about summed up the blastended skrewts in harrys opinion they looked like deformed shellless lobsters horribly pale and slimylooking with legs sticking out in very odd places and no visible heads there were about a hundred of them in each crate each about six inches long crawling over one another bumping blindly into the sides of the boxes they were giving off a very powerful smell of rotting fish every now and then sparks would fly out of the end of a skrewt and with a small phut it would be propelled forward several inchesony jus hatched said hagrid proudly so yehll be able ter raise em yerselves thought wed make a bit of a project of itand why would we want to raise them said a cold voicethe slytherins had arrived the speaker was draco malfoy crabbe and goyle were chuckling appreciatively at his words	hagrid looked stumped at the questioni mean what do they do asked malfoy what is the point of themhagrid opened his mouth apparently thinking hard there was a few seconds pause then he said roughly thas next lesson malfoy yer jus feedin em today now yehll wan ter try em on a few diffrent things ive never had em before not sure what theyll go fer i got ant eggs an frog livers an a bit o grass snake just try em out with a bit of eachfirst pus and now this muttered seamusnothing but deep affection for hagrid could have made harry ron and hermione pick up squelchy handfuls of frog liver and lower them into the crates to tempt the blastended skrewts harry couldnt suppress the suspicion that the whole thing was entirely pointless because the skrewts didnt seem to have mouthsouch yelled dean thomas after about ten minutes it got mehagrid hurried over to him looking anxiousits end exploded said dean angrily showing hagrid a burn on his handah yeah that can happen when they blast off said hagrid noddingeurgh said lavender brown again eurgh hagrid whats that pointy thing on itah some of em have got stings said hagrid enthusiastically lavender quickly withdrew her hand from the box i reckon theyre the males the femalesve got sorta sucker things on their bellies i think they might be ter suck bloodwell i can certainly see why were trying to keep them alive said malfoy sarcastically who wouldnt want pets that can burn sting and bite all at oncejust because theyre not very pretty it doesnt mean theyre not useful hermione snapped dragon bloods amazingly magical but you wouldnt want a dragon for a pet would youharry and ron grinned at hagrid who gave them a furtive smile from behind his bushy beard hagrid would have liked nothing better than a pet dragon as harry ron and hermione knew only too well he had owned one for a brief period during their first year a vicious norwegian ridgeback by the name of norbert hagrid simply loved monstrous creatures the more lethal the betterwell at least the skrewts are small said ron as they made their way back up to the castle for lunch an hour laterthey are now said hermione in an exasperated voice but once hagrids found out what they eat i expect theyll be six feet longwell that wont matter if they turn out to cure seasickness or something will it said ron grinning slyly at heryou know perfectly well i only said that to shut malfoy up said hermione as a matter of fact i think hes right the best thing to do would be to stamp on the lot of them before they start attacking us allthey sat down at the gryffindor table and helped themselves to lamb chops and potatoes hermione began to eat so fast that harry and ron stared at herer is this the new stand on elf rights said ron youre going to make yourself puke insteadno said hermione with as much dignity as she could muster with her mouth bulging with sprouts i just want to get to the librarywhat said ron in disbelief hermione its the first day back we havent even got homework yethermione shrugged and continued to shovel down her food as though she had not eaten for days then she leapt to her feet said see you at dinner and departed at high speedwhen the bell rang to signal the start of afternoon lessons harry and ron set off for north tower where at the top of a tightly spiraling staircase a silver stepladder led to a circular trapdoor in the ceiling and the room where professor trelawney livedthe familiar sweet perfume spreading from the fire met their nostrils as they emerged at the top of the stepladder as ever the curtains were all closed the circular room was bathed in a dim reddish light cast by the many lamps which were all draped with scarves and shawls harry and ron walked through the mass of occupied chintz chairs and poufs that cluttered the room and sat down at the same small circular tablegood day said the misty voice of professor trelawney right behind harry making him jumpa very thin woman with enormous glasses that made her eyes appear far too large for her face professor trelawney was peering down at harry with the tragic expression she always wore whenever she saw him the usual large amount of beads chains and bangles glittered upon her person in the firelightyou are preoccupied my dear she said mournfully to harry my inner eye sees past your brave face to the troubled soul within and i regret to say that your worries are not baseless i see difficult times ahead for you alas most difficult i fear the thing you dread will indeed come to pass and perhaps sooner than you thinkher voice dropped almost to a whisper ron rolled his eyes at harry who looked stonily back professor trelawney swept past them and seated herself in a large winged armchair before the fire facing the class lavender brown and parvati patil who deeply admired professor trelawney were sitting on poufs very close to hermy dears it is time for us to consider the stars she said the movements of the planets and the mysterious portents they reveal only to those who understand the steps of the celestial dance human destiny may be deciphered by the planetary rays which intermingle but harrys thoughts had drifted the perfumed fire always made him feel sleepy and dullwitted and professor trelawneys rambling talks on fortunetelling never held him exactly spellbound though he couldnt help thinking about what she had just said to him i fear the thing you dread will indeed come to passbut hermione was right harry thought irritably professor trelawney really was an old fraud he wasnt dreading anything at the moment at all well unless you counted his fears that sirius had been caught but what did professor trelawney know he had long since come to the conclusion that her brand of fortunetelling was really no more than lucky guesswork and a spooky mannerexcept of course for that time at the end of last term when she had made the prediction about voldemort rising again and dumbledore himself had said that he thought that trance had been genuine when harry had described it to himharry ron mutteredwhatharry looked around the whole class was staring at him he sat up straight he had been almost dozing off lost in the heat and his thoughtsi was saying my dear that you were clearly born under the baleful influence of saturn said professor trelawney a faint note of resentment in her voice at the fact that he had obviously not been hanging on her wordsborn under what sorry said harrysaturn dear the planet saturn said professor trelawney sounding definitely irritated that he wasnt riveted by this news i was saying that saturn was surely in a position of power in the heavens at the moment of your birth your dark hair your mean staturetragic losses so young in life i think i am right in saying my dear that you were born in midwinterno said harry i was born in julyron hastily turned his laugh into a hacking coughhalf an hour later each of them had been given a complicated circular chart and was attempting to fill in the position of the planets at their moment of birth it was dull work requiring much consultation of timetables and calculation of anglesive got two neptunes here said harry after a while frowning down at his piece of parchment that cant be right can itaaaaah said ron imitating professor trelawneys mystical whisper when two neptunes appear in the sky it is a sure sign that a midget in glasses is being born harry seamus and dean who were working nearby sniggered loudly though not loudly enough to mask the excited squeals from lavender brown oh professor look i think ive got an unaspected planet oooh which ones that professorit is uranus my dear said professor trelawney peering down at the chartcan i have a look at uranus too lavender said ronmost unfortunately professor trelawney heard him and it was this perhaps that made her give them so much homework at the end of the classa detailed analysis of the way the planetary movements in the coming month will affect you with reference to your personal chart she snapped sounding much more like professor mcgonagall than her usual airyfairy self i want it ready to hand in next monday and no excusesmiserable old bat said ron bitterly as they joined the crowds descending the staircases back to the great hall and dinner thatll take all weekend that will lots of homework said hermione brightly catching up with them professor vector didnt give us any at allwell bully for professor vector said ron moodilythey reached the entrance hall which was packed with people queuing for dinner they had just joined the end of the line when a loud voice rang out behind themweasley hey weasleyharry ron and hermione turned malfoy crabbe and goyle were standing there each looking thoroughly pleased about somethingwhat said ron shortlyyour dads in the paper weasley said malfoy brandishing a copy of the daily prophet and speaking very loudly so that everyone in the packed entrance hall could hear listen to thisfurther mistakes at the ministry of magicit seems as though the ministry of magics troubles are not yet at an end writes rita skeeter special correspondent recently under fire for its poorcrowd control at the quidditch world cup and still unable to account for the disappearance of one of its witches the ministry was plunged into fresh embarrassment yesterday by the antics of arnold weasley of the misuse of muggle artifacts officemalfoy looked upimagine them not even getting his name right weasley its almost as though hes a complete nonentity isnt it he crowedeveryone in the entrance hall was listening now malfoy straightened the paper with a flourish and read onarnold weasley who was charged with possession of a flying car two years ago was yesterday involved in a tussle with several muggle lawkeepers policemen over a number of highly aggressive dustbins mr weasley appears to have rushed to the aid of madeye moody the aged exauror who retired from the ministry when no longer able to tell the difference between a handshake and attempted murder unsurprisingly mr weasley found upon arrival at mr moodys heavily guarded house that mr moody had once again raised a false alarm mr weasley was forced to modify several memories before he could escape from the policemen but refused to answer daily prophet questions about why he had involved the ministry in such an undignified and potentially embarrassing sceneand theres a picture weasley said malfoy flipping the paper over and holding it up a picture of your parents outside their house if you can call it a house your mother could do with losing a bit of weight couldnt sheron was shaking with fury everyone was staring at himget stuffed malfoy said harry cmon ron oh yeah you were staying with them this summer werent you potter sneered malfoy so tell me is his mother really that porky or is it just the pictureyou know your mother malfoy said harry both he and hermione had grabbed the back of rons robes to stop him from launching himself at malfoy that expression shes got like shes got dung under her nose has she always looked like that or was it just because you were with hermalfoys pale face went slightly pinkdont you dare insult my mother potterkeep your fat mouth shut then said harry turning awaybangseveral people screamed harry felt something whitehot graze the side of his face he plunged his hand into his robes for his wand but before hed even touched it he heard a second loud bang and a roar that echoed through the entrance halloh no you dont laddieharry spun around professor moody was limping down the marble staircase his wand was out and it was pointing right at a pure white ferret which was shivering on the stoneflagged floor exactly where malfoy had been standingthere was a terrified silence in the entrance hall nobody but moody was moving a muscle moody turned to look at harry at least his normal eye was looking at harry the other one was pointing into the back of his headdid he get you moody growled his voice was low and gravellyno said harry missedleave it moody shoutedleave what harry said bewilderednot you him moody growled jerking his thumb over his shoulder at crabbe who had just frozen about to pick up the white ferret it seemed that moodys rolling eye was magical and could see out of the back of his headmoody started to limp toward crabbe goyle and the ferret which gave a terrified squeak and took off streaking toward the dungeonsi dont think so roared moody pointing his wand at the ferret again it flew ten feet into the air fell with a smack to the floor and then bounced upward once morei dont like people who attack when their opponents backs turned growled moody as the ferret bounced higher and higher squealing in pain stinking cowardly scummy thing to dothe ferret flew through the air its legs and tail flailing helplessly never do that again said moody speaking each word as the ferret hit the stone floor and bounced upward again professor moody said a shocked voiceprofessor mcgonagall was coming down the marble staircase with her arms full of bookshello professor mcgonagall said moody calmly bouncing the ferret still higherwhat what are you doing said professor mcgonagall her eyes following the bouncing ferrets progress through the airteaching said moodyteach moody is that a student shrieked professor mcgonagall the books spilling out of her armsyep said moodyno cried professor mcgonagall running down the stairs and pulling out her wand a moment later with a loud snapping noise draco malfoy had reappeared lying in a heap on the floor with his sleek blond hair all over his now brilliantly pink face he got to his feet wincingmoody we never use transfiguration as a punishment said professor mcgonagall wealdy surely professor dumbledore told you thathe mightve mentioned it yeah said moody scratching his chin unconcernedly but i thought a good sharp shock we give detentions moody or speak to the offenders head of houseill do that then said moody staring at malfoy with great dislikemalfoy whose pale eyes were still watering with pain and humiliation looked malevolently up at moody and muttered something in which the words my father were distinguishableoh yeah said moody quietly limping forward a few steps the dull clunk of his wooden leg echoing around the hall well i know your father of old boy you tell him moodys keeping a close eye on his son you tell him that from me now your head of housell be snape will ityes said malfoy resentfullyanother old friend growled moody ive been looking forward to a chat with old snape come on you and he seized malfoys upper arm and marched him off toward the dungeonsprofessor mcgonagall stared anxiously after them for a few moments then waved her wand at her fallen books causing them to soar up into the air and back into her armsdont talk to me ron said quietly to harry and hermione as they sat down at the gryffindor table a few minutes later surrounded by excited talk on all sides about what had just happenedwhy not said hermione in surprisebecause i want to fix that in my memory forever said ron his eyes closed and an uplifted expression on his face draco malfoy the amazing bouncing ferretharry and hermione both laughed and hermione began doling beef casserole onto each of their plateshe could have really hurt malfoy though she said it was good really that professor mcgonagall stopped it hermione said ron furiously his eyes snapping open again youre ruining the best moment of my lifehermione made an impatient noise and began to eat at top speed againdont tell me youre going back to the library this evening said harry watching hergot to said hermione thickly loads to dobut you told us professor vector its not schoolwork she said within five minutes she had cleared her plate and departed no sooner had she gone than her seat was taken by fred weasleymoody he said how cool is hebeyond cool said george sitting down opposite fred supercool said the twins best friend lee jordan sliding into the seat beside george we had him this afternoon he told harry and ronwhat was it like said harry eagerlyfred george and lee exchanged looks full of meaningnever had a lesson like it said fredhe knows man said leeknows what said ron leaning forwardknows what its like to be out there doing it said george impressivelydoing what said harryfighting the dark arts said fredhes seen it all said georgemazing said leeron dived into his bag for his schedulewe havent got him till thursday he said in a disappointed voice chapter fourteen the unforgivable cursesthe next two days passed without great incident unless you counted neville melting his sixth cauldron in potions professor snape who seemed to have attained new levels of vindictiveness over the summer gave nevihle detention and neville returned from it in a state of nervous collapse having been made to disembowel a barrel full of horned toadsyou know why snapes in such a foul mood dont you said ron to harry as they watched hermione teaching neville a scouring charm to remove the frog guts from under his fingernails yeah said harry moodyit was common knowledge that snape really wanted the dark arts job and he had now failed to get it for the fourth year running snape had disliked all of their previous dark arts teachers and shown it but he seemed strangely wary of displaying overt animosity to madeye moody indeed whenever harry saw the two of them together at mealtimes or when they passed in the corridors he had the distinct impression that snape was avoiding moodys eye whether magical or normali reckon snapes a bit scared of him you know harry said thoughtfullyimagine if moody turned snape into a horned toad said ron his eyes misting over and bounced him all around his dungeonthe gryffindor fourth years were looking forward to moodys first lesson so much that they arrived early on thursday lunchtime and queued up outside his classroom before the bell had even rung the only person missing was hermione who turned up just in time for the lessonbeen in the library harry finished her sentence for her cmon quick or we wont get decent seatsthey hurried into three chairs right in front of the teachers desk took out their copies of the dark forces a guide to selfprotection and waited unusually quiet soon they heard moodys distinctive clunking footsteps coming down the corridor and he entered the room looking as strange and frightening as ever they could just see his clawed wooden foot protruding from underneath his robesyou can put those away he growled stumping over to his desk and sitting down those books you wont need themthey returned the books to their bags ron looking excitedmoody took out a register shook his long mane of grizzled gray hair out of his twisted and scarred face and began to call out names his normal eye moving steadily down the list while his magical eye swiveled around fixing upon each student as he or she answeredright then he said when the last person had declared themselves present ive had a letter from professor lupin about this class seems youve had a pretty thorough grounding in tackling dark creatures youve covered boggarts red caps hinkypunks grindylows kappas and werewolves is that rightthere was a general murmur of assentbut youre behind very behind on dealing with curses said moody so im here to bring you up to scratch on what wizards can do to each other ive got one year to teach you how to deal with dark what arent you staying ron blurted outmoodys magical eye spun around to stare at ron ron looked extremely apprehensive but after a moment moody smiled the first time harry had seen him do so the effect was to make his heavily scarred face look more twisted and contorted than ever but it was nevertheless good to know that he ever did anything as friendly as smile ron looked deeply relievedyoull be arthur weasleys son eh moody said your father got me out of a very tight corner a few days ago yeah im staying just the one year special favor to dumbledore one year and then back to my quiet retirementhe gave a harsh laugh and then clapped his gnarled hands togetherso straight into it curses they come in many strengths and forms now according to the ministry of magic im supposed to teach you countercurses and leave it at that im not supposed to show you what illegal dark curses look like until youre in the sixth year youre not supposed to be old enough to deal with it till then but professor dumbledores got a higher opinion of your nerves he reckons you can cope and i say the sooner you know what youre up against the better how are you supposed to defend yourself against something youve never seen a wizard whos about to put an illegal curse on you isnt going to tell you what hes about to do hes not going to do it nice and polite to your face you need to be prepared you need to be alert and watchful you need to put that away miss brown when im talkinglavender jumped and blushed she had been showing parvati her completed horoscope under the desk apparently moodys magical eye could see through solid wood as well as out of the back of his headso do any of you know which curses are most heavily punished by wizarding lawseveral hands rose tentatively into the air including rons and hermiones moody pointed at ron though his magical eye was still fixed on lavenderer said ron tentatively my dad told me about one is it called the imperius curse or somethingah yes said moody appreciatively your father would know that one gave the ministry a lot of trouble at one time the imperius cursemoody got heavily to his mismatched feet opened his desk drawer and took out a glass jar three large black spiders were scuttling around inside it harry felt ron recoil slightly next to him ron hated spidersmoody reached into the jar caught one of the spiders and held it in the palm of his hand so that they could all see it he then pointed his wand at it and muttered imperiothe spider leapt from moodys hand on a fine thread of silk and began to swing backward and forward as though on a trapeze it stretched out its legs rigidly then did a back flip breaking the thread and landing on the desk where it began to cartwheel in circles moody jerked his wand and the spider rose onto two of its hind legs and went into what was unmistakably a tap danceeveryone was laughing everyone except moodythink its funny do you he growled youd like it would you if i did it to youthe laughter died away almost instantlytotal control said moody quietly as the spider balled itself up and began to roll over and over i could make it jump out of the window drown itself throw itself down one of your throats ron gave an involuntary shudderyears back there were a lot of witches and wizards being controlled by the imperius curse said moody and harry knew he was talking about the days in which voldemort had been allpowerful some job for the ministry trying to sort out who was being forced to act and who was acting of their own free willthe imperius curse can be fought and ill be teaching you how but it takes real strength of character and not everyones got it better avoid being hit with it if you can constant vigilance he barked and everyone jumpedmoody picked up the somersaulting spider and threw it back into the jaranyone else know one another illegal cursehermiones hand flew into the air again and so to harrys slight surprise did nevilles the only class in which neville usually volunteered information was herbology which was easily his best subject neville looked surprised at his own daringyes said moody his magical eye rolling right over to fix on nevilletheres one the cruciatus curse said neville in a small but distinct voicemoody was looking very intently at neville this time with both eyesyour names longbottom he said his magical eye swooping down to check the register againneville nodded nervously but moody made no further inquiries turning back to the class at large he reached into the jar for the next spider and placed it upon the desktop where it remained motionless apparently too scared to movethe cruciatus curse said moody needs to be a bit bigger for you to get the idea he said pointing his wand at the spider engorgiothe spider swelled it was now larger than a tarantula abandoning all pretense ron pushed his chair backward as far away from moodys desk as possiblemoody raised his wand again pointed it at the spider and muttered crucioat once the spiders legs bent in upon its body it rolled over and began to twitch horribly rocking from side to side no sound came from it but harry was sure that if it could have given voice it would have been screaming moody did not remove his wand and the spider started to shudder and jerk more violently stop it hermione said shrillyharry looked around at her she was looking not at the spider but at neville and harry following her gaze saw that nevilles hands were clenched upon the desk in front of him his knuckles white his eyes wide and horrifiedmoody raised his wand the spiders legs relaxed but it continued to twitchreducio moody muttered and the spider shrank back to its proper size he put it back into the jarpain said moody softly you dont need thumbscrews or knives to torture someone if you can perform the cruciatus curse that one was very popular once tooright anyone know any othersharry looked around from the looks on everyones faces he guessed they were all wondering what was going to happen to the last spider hermiones hand shook slightly as for the third time she raised it into the airyes said moody looking at heravada kedavra hermione whisperedseveral people looked uneasily around at her including ronah said moody another slight smile twisting his lopsided mouth yes the last and worst avada kedavra the killing cursehe put his hand into the glass jar and almost as though it knew what was coming the third spider scuttled frantically around the bottom of the jar trying to evade moodys fingers but he trapped it and placed it upon the desktop it started to scuttle frantically across the wooden surfacemoody raised his wand and harry felt a sudden thrill of forebodingavada kedavra moody roaredthere was a flash of blinding green light and a rushing sound as though a vast invisible something was soaring through the air instantaneously the spider rolled over onto its back unmarked but unmistakably dead several of the students stifled cries ron had thrown himself backward and almost toppled off his seat as the spider skidded toward himmoody swept the dead spider off the desk onto the floornot nice he said calmly not pleasant and theres no countercurse theres no blocking it only one known person has ever survived it and hes sitting right in front of meharry felt his face redden as moodys eyes both of them looked into his own he could feel everyone else looking around at him too harry stared at the blank blackboard as though fascinated by it but not really seeing it at allso that was how his parents had died exactly like that spider had they been unblemished and unmarked too had they simply seen the flash of green light and heard the rush of speeding death before life was wiped from their bodiesharry had been picturing his parents deaths over and over again for three years now ever since hed found out they had been murdered ever since hed found out what had happened that night wormtail had betrayed his parents whereabouts to voldemort who had come to find them at their cottage how voldemort had killed harrys father first how james potter had tried to hold him off while he shouted at his wife to take harry and run voldemort had advanced on lily potter told her to move aside so that he could kill harry how she had begged him to kill her instead refused to stop shielding her son and so voldemort had murdered her too before turning his wand on harryharry knew these details because he had heard his parents voices when he had fought the dementors last year for that was the terrible power of the dementors to force their victims to relive the worst memories of their lives and drown powerless in their own despairmoody was speaking again from a great distance it seemed to harry with a massive effort he pulled himself back to the present and listened to what moody was sayingavada kedavras a curse that needs a powerful bit of magic behind it you could all get your wands out now and point them at me and say the words and i doubt id get so much as a nosebleed but that doesnt matter im not here to teach you how to do itnow if theres no countercurse why am i showing you because youve got to know youve got to appreciate what the worst is you dont want to find yourself in a situation where youre facing it constant vigilance he roared and the whole class jumped againnow those three curses avada kedavra imperius and cruciatus are known as the unforgivable curses the use of any one of them on a fellow human being is enough to earn a life sentence in azkaban thats what youre up against thats what ive got to teach you to fight you need preparing you need arming but most of all you need to practice constant neverceasing vigilance get out your quills copy this down they spent the rest of the lesson taking notes on each of the unforgivable curses no one spoke until the bell rang but when moody had dismissed them and they had left the classroom a torrent of talk burst forth most people were discussing the curses in awed voices did you see it twitch and when he killed it just like thatthey were talking about the lesson harry thought as though it had been some sort of spectacular show but he hadnt found it very entertaining and nor it seemed had hermionehurry up she said tensely to harry and ronnot the ruddy library again said ronno said hermione curtly pointing up a side passage neville neville was standing alone halfway up the passage staring at the stone wall opposite him with the same horrified wideeyed look he had worn when moody had demonstrated the cruciatus curseneville hermione said gentlyneville looked aroundoh hello he said his voice much higher than usual interesting lesson wasnt it i wonder whats for dinner im im starving arent youneville are you all right said hermioneoh yes im fine neville gabbled in the same unnaturally high voice very interesting dinner i mean lesson whats for eatingron gave harry a startled lookneville what but an odd clunking noise sounded behind them and they turned to see professor moody limping toward them all four of them fell silent watching him apprehensively but when he spoke it was in a much lower and gentler growl than they had yet heardits all right sonny he said to neville why dont you come up to my office come on we can have a cup of tea neville looked even more frightened at the prospect of tea with moody he neither moved nor spoke moody turned his magical eye upon harryyou all right are you potteryes said harry almost defiantlymoodys blue eye quivered slightly in its socket as it surveyed harry then he said youve got to know it seems harsh maybe but youve got to know no point pretending well come on longbottom ive got some books that might interest youneville looked pleadingly at harry ron and hermione but they didnt say anything so neville had no choice but to allow himself to be steered away one of moodys gnarled hands on his shoulderwhat was that about said ron watching neville and moody turn the corneri dont know said hermione looking pensivesome lesson though eh said ron to harry as they set off for the great hall fred and george were right werent they he really knows his stuff moody doesnt he when he did avada kedavra the way that spider just died just snuffed it right but ron fell suddenly silent at the look on harrys face and didnt speak again until they reached the great hall when he said he supposed they had better make a start on professor trelawneys predictions tonight since they would take hourshermione did not join in with harry and rons conversation during dinner but ate furiously fast and then left for the library again harry and ron walked back to gryffindor tower and harry who had been thinking of nothing else all through dinner now raised the subject of the unforgivable curses himselfwouldnt moody and dumbledore be in trouble with the ministry if they knew wed seen the curses harry asked as they approached the fat ladyyeah probably said ron but dumbledores always done things his way hasnt he and moodys been getting in trouble for years i reckon attacks first and asks questions later look at his dustbins balderdashthe fat lady swung forward to reveal the entrance hole and they climbed into the gryffindor common room which was crowded and noisyshall we get our divination stuff then said harryi spose ron groanedthey went up to the dormitory to fetch their books and charts to find neville there alone sitting on his bed reading he looked a good deal calmer than at the end of moodys lesson though still not entirely normal his eyes were rather redyou all right neville harry asked himoh yes said neville im fine thanks just reading this book professor moody lent me he held up the book magical water plants of the mediterraneanapparently professor sprout told professor moody im really good at herbology neville said there was a faint note of pride in his voice that harry had rarely heard there before he thought id like thistelling neville what professor sprout had said harry thought had been a very tactful way of cheering neville up for neville very rarely heard that he was good at anything it was the sort of thing professor lupin would have doneharry and ron took their copies of unfogging the future back down to the common room found a table and set to work on their predictions for the coming month an hour later they had made very little progress though their table was littered with bits of parchment bearing sums and symbols and harrys brain was as fogged as though it had been filled with the fumes from professor trelawneys firei havent got a clue what this lots supposed to mean he said staring down at a long list of calculationsyou know said ron whose hair was on end because of all the times he had run his fingers through it in frustration i think its back to the old divination standbywhat make it upyeah said ron sweeping the jumble of scrawled notes off the table dipping his pen into some ink and starting to writenext monday he said as he scribbled i am likely to develop a cough owing to the unlucky conjunction of mars and jupiter he looked up at harry you know her just put in loads of misery shell lap it upright said harry crumpling up his first attempt and lobbing it over the heads of a group of chattering first years into the fire okay on monday i will be in danger of er burnsyeah you will be said ron darkly were seeing the skrewts again on monday okay tuesday ill erm lose a treasured possession said harry who was flicking through unfogging the future for ideasgood one said ron copying it down because of erm mercury why dont you get stabbed in the back by someone you thought was a friendyeah cool said harry scribbling it down because venus is in the twelfth houseand on wednesday i think ill come off worst in a fightaaah i was going to have a fight okay ill lose a betyeah youll be betting ill win my fight they continued to make up predictions which grew steadily more tragic for another hour while the common room around them slowly emptied as people went up to bed crookshanks wandered over to them leapt lightly into an empty chair and stared inscrutably at harry rather as hermione might look if she knew they werent doing their homework properlystaring around the room trying to think of a kind of misfortune he hadnt yet used harry saw fred and george sitting together against the opposite wall heads together quills out poring over a single piece of parchment it was most unusual to see fred and george hidden away in a corner and working silently they usually liked to be in the thick of things and the noisy center of attention there was something secretive about the way they were working on the piece of parchment and harry was reminded of how they had sat together writing something back at the burrow he had thought then that it was another order form for weasleys wizard wheezes but it didnt look like that this time if it had been they would surely have let lee jordan in on the joke he wondered whether it had anything to do with entering the triwizard tournamentas harry watched george shook his head at fred scratched out something with his quill and said in a very quiet voice that nevertheless carried across the almost deserted room no that sounds like were accusing him got to be careful then george looked over and saw harry watching him harry grinned and quickly returned to his predictions he didnt want george to think he was eavesdropping shortly after that the twins rolled up their parchment said good night and went off to bedfred and george had been gone ten minutes or so when the portrait hole opened and hermione climbed into the common room carrying a sheaf of parchment in one hand and a box whose contents rattled as she walked in the other crookshanks arched his back purringhello she said ive just finishedso have i said ron triumphantly throwing down his quillhermione sat down laid the things she was carrying in an empty armchair and pulled rons predictions toward hernot going to have a very good month are you she said sardonically as crookshanks curled up in her lapah well at least im forewarned ron yawnedyou seem to be drowning twice said hermioneoh am i said ron peering down at his predictions id better change one of them to getting trampled by a rampaging hippogriffdont you think its a bit obvious youve made these up said hermionehow dare you said ron in mock outrage weve been working like houseelves herehermione raised her eyebrowsits just an expression said ron hastilyharry laid down his quill too having just finished predicting his own death by decapitationwhats in the box he asked pointing at itfunny you should ask said hermione with a nasty look at ron she took off the lid and showed them the contentsinside were about fifty badges all of different colors but all bearing the same letters s p e wspew said harry picking up a badge and looking at it whats this aboutnot spew said hermione impatiently its spew stands for the society for the promotion of elfish welfarenever heard of it said ronwell of course you havent said hermione briskly ive only just started ityeah said ron in mild surprise how many members have you gotwell if you two join three said hermioneand you think we want to walk around wearing badges saying spew do you said ronspew said hermione hotly i was going to put stop the outrageous abuse of our fellow magical creatures and campaign for a change in their legal status but it wouldnt fit so thats the heading of our manifestoshe brandished the sheaf of parchment at themive been researching it thoroughly in the library elf enslavement goes back centuries i cant believe no ones done anything about it before nowhermione open your ears said ron loudly they like it they like being enslavedour shortterm aims said hermione speaking even more loudly than ron and acting as though she hadnt heard a word are to secure houseelves fair wages and working conditions our longterm aims include changing the law about nonwand use and trying to get an elf into the department for the regulation and control of magical creatures because theyre shockingly underrepresentedand how do we do all this harry askedwe start by recruiting members said hermione happily i thought two sickles to join that buys a badge and the proceeds can fund our leaflet campaign youre treasurer ron ive got you a collecting tin upstairs and harry youre secretary so you might want to write down everything im saying now as a record of our first meetingthere was a pause in which hermione beamed at the pair of them and harry sat torn between exasperation at hermione and amusement at the look on rons face the silence was broken not by ron who in any case looked as though he was temporarily dumbstruck but by a soft tap tap on the window harry looked across the now empty common room and saw illuminated by the moonlight a snowy owl perched on the windowsillhedwig he shouted and he launched himself out of his chair and across the room to pull open the windowhedwig flew inside soared across the room and landed on the table on top of harrys predictionsabout time said harry hurrying after hershes got an answer said ron excitedly pointing at the grubby piece of parchment tied to hedwigs legharry hastily untied it and sat down to read whereupon hedwig fluttered onto his knee hooting softlywhat does it say hermione asked breathlesslythe letter was very short and looked as though it had been scrawled in a great hurry harry read it aloudharry im flying north immediately this news about your scar is the latest in a series of strange rumors that have reached me here if it hurts again go straight to dumbledore theyre saying hes got madeye out of retirement which means hes reading the signs even if no one else isill be in touch soon my best to ron and hermione keep your eyes open harrysiriusharry looked up at ron and hermione who stared back at him hes flying north hermione whispered hes coming backdumbledores reading what signs said ron looking perplexed harry whats upfor harry had just hit himself in the forehead with his fist jolting hedwig out of his lapi shouldntve told him harry said furiouslywhat are you on about said ron in surpriseits made him think hes got to come back said harry now slamming his fist on the table so that hedwig landed on the back of rons chair hooting indignantly coming back because he thinks im in trouble and theres nothing wrong with me and i havent got anything for you harry snapped at hedwig who was clicking her beak expectantly youll have to go up to the owlery if you want foodhedwig gave him an extremely offended look and took off for the open window cuffing him around the head with her outstretched wing as she wentharry hermione began in a pacifying sort of voiceim going to bed said harry shortly see you in the morningupstairs in the dormitory he pulled on his pajamas and got into his fourposter but he didnt feel remotely tiredif sirius came back and got caught it would be his harrys fault why hadnt he kept his mouth shut a few seconds pain and hed had to blab if hed just had the sense to keep it to himselfhe heard ron come up into the dormitory a short while later but did not speak to him for a long time harry lay staring up at the dark canopy of his bed the dormitory was completely silent and had he been less preoccupied harry would have realized that the absence of nevilles usual snores meant that he was not the only one lying awakechapter fifteen beauxbatons and durmstrangearly next morning harry woke with a plan fully formed in his mind as though his sleeping brain had been working on it all night he got up dressed in the pale dawn light left the dormitory without waking ron and went back down to the deserted common room here he took a piece of parchment from the table upon which his divination homework still lay and wrote the following letterdear siriusi reckon i just imagined my scar hurting i was half asleep when i wrote to you last time theres no point coming back everythings fine here dont worry about me my head feels completely normalharryhe then climbed out of the portrait hole up through the silent castle held up only briefly by peeves who tried to overturn a large vase on him halfway along the fourthfloor corridor finally arriving at the owlery which was situated at the top of west towerthe owlery was a circular stone room rather cold and drafty because none of the windows had glass in them the floor was entirely covered in straw owl droppings and the regurgitated skeletons of mice and voles hundreds upon hundreds of owls of every breed imaginable were nestled here on perches that rose right up to the top of the tower nearly all of them asleep though here and there a round amber eye glared at harry he spotted hedwig nestled between a barn owl and a tawny and hurried over to her sliding a little on the droppingstrewn floorit took him a while to persuade her to wake up and then to look at him as she kept shuffling around on her perch showing him her tail she was evidently still furious about his lack of gratitude the previous night in the end it was harry suggesting she might be too tired and that perhaps he would ask ron to borrow pigwidgeon that made her stick out her leg and allow him to tie the letter to itjust find him all right harry said stroking her back as he carried her on his arm to one of the holes in the wall before the dementors doshe nipped his finger perhaps rather harder than she would ordinarily have done but hooted softly in a reassuring sort of way all the same then she spread her wings and took off into the sunrise harry watched her fly out of sight with the familiar feeling of unease back in his stomach he had been so sure that siriuss reply would alleviate his worries rather than increasing themthat was a lie harry said hermione sharply over breakfast when he told her and ron what he had done you didnt imagine your scar hurting and you know itso what said harry hes not going back to azkaban because of medrop it said ron sharply to hermione as she opened her mouth to argue some more and for once hermione heeded him and fell silentharry did his best not to worry about sirius over the next couple of weeks true he could not stop himself from looking anxiously around every morning when the post owls arrived nor late at night before he went to sleep prevent himself from seeing horrible visions of sirius cornered by dementors down some dark london street but betweentimes he tried to keep his mind off his godfather he wished he still had quidditch to distract him nothing worked so well on a troubled mind as a good hard training session on the other hand their lessons were becoming more difficult and demanding than ever before particularly moodys defense against the dark artsto their surprise professor moody had announced that he would be putting the imperius curse on each of them in turn to demonstrate its power and to see whether they could resist its effectsbut but you said its illegal professor said hermione uncertainly as moody cleared away the desks with a sweep of his wand leaving a large clear space in the middle of the room you said to use it against another human was dumbledore wants you taught what it feels like said moody his magical eye swiveling onto hermione and fixing her with an eerie unblinking stare if youd rather learn the hard way when someones putting it on you so they can control you completely fine by me youre excused off you gohe pointed one gnarled finger toward the door hermione went very pink and muttered something about not meaning that she wanted to leave harry and ron grinned at each other they knew hermione would rather eat bubotuber pus than miss such an important lessonmoody began to beckon students forward in turn and put the imperius curse upon them harry watched as one by one his classmates did the most extraordinary things under its influence dean thomas hopped three times around the room singing the national anthem lavender brown imitated a squirrel neville performed a series of quite astonishing gymnastics he would certainly not have been capable of in his normal state not one of them seemed to be able to fight off the curse and each of them recovered only when moody had removed itpotter moody growled you nextharry moved forward into the middle of the classroom into the space that moody had cleared of desks moody raised his wand pointed it at harry and said mperioit was the most wonderful feeling harry felt a floating sensation as every thought and worry in his head was wiped gently away leaving nothing but a vague untraceable happiness he stood there feeling immensely relaxed only dimly aware of everyone watching himand then he heard madeye moodys voice echoing in some distant chamber of his empty brain jump onto the desk jump onto the desk harry bent his knees obediently preparing to springjump onto the deskwhy though another voice had awoken in the back of his brainstupid thing to do really said the voicejump onto the deskno i dont think i will thanks said the other voice a little more firmly no i dont really want tojump nowthe next thing harry felt was considerable pain he had both jumped and tried to prevent himself from jumping the result was that hed smashed headlong into the desk knocking it over and by the feeling in his legs fractured both his kneecapsnow thats more like it growled moodys voice and suddenly harry felt the empty echoing feeling in his head disappear he remembered exactly what was happening and the pain in his knees seemed to doublelook at that you lot potter fought he fought it and he damn near beat it well try that again potter and the rest of you pay attention watch his eyes thats where you see it very good potter very good indeed theyll have trouble controlling youthe way he talks harry muttered as he hobbled out of the defense against the dark arts class an hour later moody had insisted on putting harry through his paces four times in a row until harry could throw off the curse entirely youd think we were all going to be attacked any secondyeah i know said ron who was skipping on every alternate step he had had much more difficulty with the curse than harry though moody assured him the effects would wear off by lunchtime talk about paranoid ron glanced nervously over his shoulder to check that moody was definitely out of earshot and went on no wonder they were glad to get shot of him at the ministry did you hear him telling seamus what he did to that witch who shouted boo behind him on april fools day and when are we supposed to read up on resisting the imperius curse with everything else weve got to doall the fourth years had noticed a definite increase in the amount of work they were required to do this term professor mcgonagall explained why when the class gave a particularly loud groan at the amount of transfiguration homework she had assignedyou are now entering a most important phase of your magical education she told them her eyes glinting dangerously behind her square spectacles your ordinary wizarding levels are drawing closer we dont take owls till fifth year s aid dean thomas indignantlymaybe not thomas but believe me you need all the preparation you can get miss granger remains the only person in this class who has managed to turn a hedgehog into a satisfactory pincushion i might remind you that your pincushion thomas still curls up in fright if anyone approaches it with a pinhermione who had turned rather pink again seemed to be trying not to look too pleased with herselfharry and ron were deeply amused when professor trelawney told them that they had received top marks for their homework in their next divination class she read out large portions of their predictions commending them for their unflinching acceptance of the horrors in store for them but they were less amused when she asked them to do the same thing for the month after next both of them were running out of ideas for catastrophesmeanwhile professor binns the ghost who taught history of magic had them writing weekly essays on the goblin rebellions of the eighteenth century professor snape was forcing them to research antidotes they took this one seriously as he had hinted that he might be poisoning one of them before christmas to see if their antidote worked professor flitwick had asked them to read three extra books in preparation for their lesson on summoning charmseven hagrid was adding to their workload the blastended skrewts were growing at a remarkable pace given that nobody had yet discovered what they ate hagrid was delighted and as part of their project suggested that they come down to his hut on alternate evenings to observe the skrewts and make notes on their extraordinary behaviori will not said draco malfoy flatly when hagrid had proposed this with the air of father christmas pulling an extralarge toy out of his sack i see enough of these foul things during lessons thankshagrids smile faded off his faceyehll do wha yer told he growled or ill be takin a leaf outta professor moodys book i hear yeh made a good ferret malfoythe gryffindors roared with laughter malfoy flushed with anger but apparently the memory of moodys punishment was still sufficiently painful to stop him from retorting harry ron and hermione returned to the castle at the end of the lesson in high spirits seeing hagrid put down malfoy was particularly satisfying especially because malfoy had done his very best to get hagrid sacked the previous yearwhen they arrived in the entrance hall they found themselves unable to proceed owing to the large crowd of students congregated there all milling around a large sign that had been erected at the foot of the marble staircase ron the tallest of the three stood on tiptoe to see over the heads in front of them and read the sign aloud to the other twotriwizard tournamentthe delegations from beauxbatons anddurmstrang will be arriving at oclockon friday the th of october lessons willend half an hour early brilliant said harry its potions last thing on friday snape wont have time to poison us allstudents will return their bags and booksto their dormitories and assemble in frontof the castle to greet our guests beforethe welcoming feastonly a week away said ernie macmillan of hufflepuff emerging from the crowd his eyes gleaming i wonder if cedric knows think ill go and tell him cedric said ron blankly as ernie hurried offdiggory said harry he must be entering the tournamentthat idiot hogwarts champion said ron as they pushed their way through the chattering crowd toward the staircasehes not an idiot you just dont like him because he beat gryffindor at quidditch said hermione ive heard hes a really good student and hes a prefectshe spoke as though this settled the matteryou only like him because hes handsome said ron scathinglyexcuse me i dont like people just because theyre handsome said hermione indignantlyron gave a loud false cough which sounded oddly like lockhartthe appearance of the sign in the entrance hall had a marked effect upon the inhabitants of the castle during the following week there seemed to be only one topic of conversation no matter where harry went the triwizard tournament rumors were flying from student to student like highly contagious germs who was going to try for hogwarts champion what the tournament would involve how the students from beauxbatons and durmstrang differed from themselvesharry noticed too that the castle seemed to be undergoing an extrathorough cleaning several grimy portraits had been scrubbed much to the displeasure of their subjects who sat huddled in their frames muttering darkly and wincing as they felt their raw pink faces the suits of armor were suddenly gleaming and moving without squeaking and argus filch the caretaker was behaving so ferociously to any students who forgot to wipe their shoes that he terrified a pair of firstyear girls into hystericsother members of the staff seemed oddly tense toolongbottom kindly do not reveal that you cant even perform a simple switching spell in front of anyone from durmstrang professor mcgonagall barked at the end of one particularly difficult lesson during which neville had accidentally transplanted his own ears onto a cactuswhen they went down to breakfast on the morning of the thirtieth of october they found that the great hall had been decorated overnight enormous silk banners hung from the walls each of them representing a hogwarts house red with a gold lion for gryffiindor blue with a bronze eagle for ravenclaw yellow with a black badger for hufflepuff and green with a silver serpent for slytherin behind the teachers table the largest banner of all bore the hogwarts coat of arms lion eagle badger and snake united around a large letter hharry ron and hermione sat down beside fred and george at the gryffindor table once again and most unusually they were sitting apart from everyone else and conversing in low voices ron led the way over to themits a bummer all right george was saying gloomily to fred but if he wont talk to us in person well have to send him the letter after all or well stuff it into his hand he cant avoid us forreverwhos avoiding you said ron sitting down next to themwish you would said fred looking irritated at the interruptionwhats a bummer ron asked georgehaving a nosy git like you for a brother said georgeyou two got any ideas on the triwizard tournament yet harry asked thought any more about trying to enteri asked mcgonagall how the champions are chosen but she wasnt telling said george bitterly she just told me to shut up and get on with transfiguring my raccoonwonder what the tasks are going to be said ron thoughtfully you know i bet we could do them harry weve done dangerous stuff before not in front of a panel of judges you havent said fred mcgonagall says the champions get awarded points according to how well theyve done the taskswho are the judges harry askedwell the heads of the participating schools are always on the panel said hermione and everyone looked around at her rather surprised because all three of them were injured during the tournament of when a cockatrice the champions were supposed to be catching went on the rampageshe noticed them all looking at her and said with her usual air of impatience that nobody else had read all the books she had its all in hogwarts a history though of course that books not entirely reliable a revised history of hogwarts would be a more accurate title or a highly biased and selective history of hogwarts which glosses over the nastier aspects of the schoolwhat are you on about said ron though harry thought he knew what was cominghouseelves said hermione her eyes flashing not once in over a thousand pages does hogwarts a history mention that we are all colluding in the oppression of a hundred slavesharry shook his head and applied himself to his scrambled eggs his and rons lack of enthusiasm had done nothing whatsoever to curb hermiones determination to pursue justice for houseelvestrue both of them had paid two sickles for a spew badge but they had only done it to keep her quiet their sickles had been wasted however if anything they seemed to have made hermione more vociferous she had been badgering harry and ron ever since first to wear the badges then to persuade others to do the same and she had also taken to rattling around the gryffindor common room every evening cornering people and shaking the collecting tin under their nosesyou do realize that your sheets are changed your fires lit your classrooms cleaned and your food cooked by a group of magical creatures who are unpaid and enslaved she kept saying fiercelysome people like neville had paid up just to stop hermione from glowering at them a few seemed mildly interested in what she had to say but were reluctant to take a more active role in campaigning many regarded the whole thing as a jokeron now rolled his eyes at the ceiling which was flooding them all in autumn sunlight and fred became extremely interested in his bacon both twins had refused to buy a spew badge george however leaned in toward hermionelisten have you ever been down in the kitchens hermioneno of course not said hermione curtly i hardly think students are supposed to well we have said george indicating fred loads of times to nick food and weve met them and theyre happy they think theyve got the best job in the world thats because theyre uneducated and brainwashed hermione began hotly but her next few words were drowned out by the sudden whooshing noise from overhead which announced the arrival of the post owls harry looked up at once and saw hedwig soaring toward him hermione stopped talking abruptly she and ron watched hedwig anxiously as she fluttered down onto harrys shoulder folded her wings and held out her leg wearilyharry pulled off siriuss reply and offered hedwig his bacon rinds which she ate gratefully then checking that fred and george were safely immersed in further discussions about the triwizard tournament harry read out siriuss letter in a whisper to ron and hermionenice try harryim back in the country and well hidden i want you to keep me posted on everything thats going on at hogwarts dont use hedwig keep changing owls and dont worry about me just watch out for yourself dont forget what i said about your scarsiriuswhy dyou have to keep changing owls ron asked in a low voicehedwigll attract too much attention said hermione at once she stands out a snowy owl that keeps returning to wherever hes hiding i mean theyre not native birds are theyharry rolled up the letter and slipped it inside his robes wondering whether he felt more or less worried than before he supposed that sirius managing to get back without being caught was something he couldnt deny either that the idea that sirius was much nearer was reassuring at least he wouldnt have to wait so long for a response every time he wrotethanks hedwig he said stroking her she hooted sleepily dipped her beak briefly into his goblet of orange juice then took off again clearly desperate for a good long sleep in the owlerythere was a pleasant feeling of anticipation in the air that day nobody was very attentive in lessons being much more interested in the arrival that evening of the people from beauxbatons and durmstrang even potions was more bearable than usual as it was half an hour shorter when the bell rang early harry ron and hermione hurried up to gryffindor tower deposited their bags and books as they had been instructed pulled on their cloaks and rushed back downstairs into the entrance hallthe heads of houses were ordering their students into linesweasley straighten your hat professor mcgonagall snapped at ron miss patil take that ridiculous thing out of your hairparvati scowled and removed a large ornamental butterfly from the end of her plaitfollow me please said professor mcgonagall first years in front no pushing they filed down the steps and lined up in front of the castle it was a cold clear evening dusk was falling and a pale transparentlooking moon was already shining over the forbidden forest harry standing between ron and hermione in the fourth row from the front saw dennis creevey positively shivering with anticipation among the other first yearsnearly six said ron checking his watch and then staring down the drive that led to the front gates how dyou reckon theyre coming the traini doubt it said hermionehow then broomsticks harry suggested looking up at the starry skyi dont think so not from that far away a portkey ron suggested or they could apparate maybe youre allowed to do it under seventeen wherever they come fromyou cant apparate inside the hogwarts grounds how often do i have to tell you said hermione impatientlythey scanned the darkening grounds excitedly but nothing was moving everything was still silent and quite as usual harry was starting to feel cold he wished theyd hurry up maybe the foreign students were preparing a dramatic entrance he remembered what mr weasley had said back at the campsite before the quidditch world cup always the same we cant resist showing off when we get together and then dumbledore called out from the back row where he stood with the other teachers aha unless i am very much mistaken the delegation from beauxbatons approacheswhere said many students eagerly all looking in different directionsthere yelled a sixth year pointing over the forestsomething large much larger than a broomstick or indeed a hundred broomsticks was hurtling across the deep blue sky toward the castle growing larger all the timeits a dragon shrieked one of the first years losing her head completelydont be stupid its a flying house said dennis creeveydenniss guess was closer as the gigantic black shape skimmed over the treetops of the forbidden forest and the lights shining from the castle windows hit it they saw a gigantic powderblue horsedrawn carriage the size of a large house soaring toward them pulled through the air by a dozen winged horses all palominos and each the size of an elephantthe front three rows of students drew backward as the carriage hurtled ever lower coming in to land at a tremendous speed then with an almighty crash that made neville jump backward onto a slytherin fifth years foot the horses hooves larger than dinner plates hit the ground a second later the carriage landed too bouncing upon its vast wheels while the golden horses tossed their enormous heads and rolled large fiery red eyesharry just had time to see that the door of the carriage bore a coat of arms two crossed golden wands each emitting three stars before it openeda boy in pale blue robes jumped down from the carriage bent forward fumbled for a moment with something on the carriage floor and unfolded a set of golden steps he sprang back respectfully then harry saw a shining highheeled black shoe emerging from the inside of the carriage a shoe the size of a childs sled followed almost immediately by the largest woman he had ever seen in his life the size of the carriage and of the horses was immediately explained a few people gaspedharry had only ever seen one person as large as this woman in his life and that was hagrid he doubted whether there was an inch difference in their heights yet somehow maybe simply because he was used to hagrid this woman now at the foot of the steps and looking around at the waiting wideeyed crowd seemed even more unnaturally large as she stepped into the light flooding from the entrance hall she was revealed to have a handsome oliveskinned face large black liquidlooking eyes and a rather beaky nose her hair was drawn back in a shining knob at the base of her neck she was dressed from head to foot in black satin and many magnificent opals gleamed at her throat and on her thick fingersdumbledore started to clap the students following his lead broke into applause too many of them standing on tiptoe the better to look at this womanher face relaxed into a gracious smile and she walked forward toward dumbledore extending a glittering hand dumbledore though tall himself had barely to bend to kiss itmy dear madame maxime he said welcome to hogwartsdumblydort said madame maxime in a deep voice i ope i find you wellin excellent form i thank you said dumbledoremy pupils said madame maxime waving one of her enormous hands carelessly behind herharry whose attention had been focused completely upon madame maxime now noticed that about a dozen boys and girls all by the look of them in their late teens had emerged from the carriage and were now standing behind madame maxime they were shivering which was unsurprising given that their robes seemed to be made of fine silk and none of them were wearing cloaks a few had wrapped scarves and shawls around their heads from what harry could see of them they were standing in madame maximes enormous shadow they were staring up at hogwarts with apprehensive looks on their facesas karkaroff arrived yet madame maxime askedhe should be here any moment said dumbledore would you like to wait here and greet him or would you prefer to step inside and warm up a triflewarm up i think said madame maxime but ze orses our care of magical creatures teacher will be delighted to take care of them said dumbledore the moment he has returned from dealing with a slight situation that has arisen with some of his other er chargesskrewts ron muttered to harry grinningmy steeds require er forceful andling said madame maxime looking as though she doubted whether any care of magical creatures teacher at hogwarts could be up to the job zey are very strong i assure you that hagrid will be well up to the job said dumbledore smilingvery well said madame maxime bowing slightly will you please inform zis agrid zat ze orses drink only singlemalt whiskeyit will be attended to said dumbledore also bowing come said madame maxime imperiously to her students and the hogwarts crowd parted to allow her and her students to pass up the stone stepshow big dyou reckon durmstrangs horses are going to be seamus finnigan said leaning around lavender and parvati to address harry and ronwell if theyre any bigger than this lot even hagrid wont be able to handle them said harry thats if he hasnt been attacked by his skrewts wonder whats up with themmaybe theyve escaped said ron hopefullyoh dont say that said hermione with a shudder imagine that lot loose on the grounds they stood shivering slightly now waiting for the durmstrang party to arrive most people were gazing hopefully up at the skyfor a few minutes the silence was broken only by madame maximes huge horses snorting and stamping but then can you hear something said ron suddenlyharry listened a loud and oddly eerie noise was drifting toward them from out of the darkness a muffled rumbling and sucking sound as though an immense vacuum cleaner were moving along a riverbedthe lake yelled lee jordan pointing down at it look at the lakefrom their position at the top of the lawns overlooking the grounds they had a clear view of the smooth black surface of the water except that the surface was suddenly not smooth at all some disturbance was taking place deep in the center great bubbles were forming on the surface waves were now washing over the muddy banks and then out in the very middle of the lake a whirlpool appeared as if a giant plug had just been pulled out of the lakes floor what seemed to be a long black pole began to rise slowly out of the heart of the whirlpool and then harry saw the riggingits a mast he said to ron and hermioneslowly magnificently the ship rose out of the water gleaming in the moonlight it had a strangely skeletal look about it as though it were a resurrected wreck and the dim misty lights shimmering at its portholes looked like ghostly eyes finally with a great sloshing noise the ship emerged entirely bobbing on the turbulent water and began to glide toward the bank a few moments later they heard the splash of an anchor being thrown down in the shallows and the thud of a plank being lowered onto the bankpeople were disembarking they could see their silhouettes passing the lights in the ships portholes all of them harry noticed seemed to be built along the lines of crabbe and goyle but then as they drew nearer walking up the lawns into the light streaming from the entrance hall he saw that their bulk was really due to the fact that they were wearing cloaks of some kind of shaggy matted fur but the man who was leading them up to the castle was wearing furs of a different sort sleek and silver like his hairdumbledore he called heartily as he walked up the slope how are you my dear fellow how are youblooming thank you professor karkaroff dumbledore replied karkaroff had a fruity unctuous voice when he stepped into the light pouring from the front doors of the castle they saw that he was tall and thin like dumbledore but his white hair was short and his goatee finishing in a small curl did not entirely hide his rather weak chin when he reached dumbledore he shook hands with both of his owndear old hogwarts he said looking up at the castle and smiling his teeth were rather yellow and harry noticed that his smile did not extend to his eyes which remained cold and shrewd how good it is to be here how good viktor come along into the warmth you dont mind dumbledore viktor has a slight head coldkarkaroff beckoned forward one of his students as the boy passed harry caught a glimpse of a prominent curved nose and thick black eyebrows he didnt need the punch on the arm ron gave him or the hiss in his ear to recognize that profileharry its krumchapter sixteen the goblet of firei dont believe it ron said in a stunned voice as the hogwarts students filed back up the steps behind the party from durmstrang krum harry viktor krumfor heavens sake ron hes only a quidditch player said hermioneonly a quidditch player ron said looking at her as though he couldnt believe his ears hermione hes one of the best seekers in the world i had no idea he was still at schoolas they recrossed the entrance hall with the rest of the hogwarts students heading for the great hall harry saw lee jordan jumping up and down on the soles of his feet to get a better look at the back of krums head several sixthyear girls were frantically searching their pockets as they walked oh i dont believe it i havent got a single quill on me dyou think hed sign my hat in lipstickreally hermione said loftily as they passed the girls now squabbling over the lipstickim getting his autograph if i can said ron you havent got a quill have you harrynope theyre upstairs in my bag said harrythey walked over to the gryffindor table and sat down ron took care to sit on the side facing the doorway because krum and his fellow durmstrang students were still gathered around it apparently unsure about where they should sit the students from beauxbatons had chosen seats at the ravenclaw table they were looking around the great hall with glum expressions on their faces three of them were still clutching scarves and shawls around their headsits not that cold said hermione defensively why didnt they bring cloaksover here come and sit over here ron hissed over here hermione budge up make a space whattoo late said ron bitterlyviktor krum and his fellow durmstrang students had settled themselves at the slytherin table harry could see malfoy crabbe and goyle looking very smug about this as he watched malfoy bent forward to speak to krumyeah thats right smarm up to him malfoy said ron scathingly i bet krum can see right through him though bet he gets people fawning over him all the time where dyou reckon theyre going to sleep we could offer him a space in our dormitory harry i wouldnt mind giving him my bed i could kip on a camp bedhermione snortedthey look a lot happier than the beauxbatons lot said harry the durmstrang students were pulling off their heavy furs and looking up at the starry black ceiling with expressions of interest a couple of them were picking up the golden plates and goblets and examining them apparently impressedup at the staff table filch the caretaker was adding chairs he was wearing his moldy old tailcoat in honor of the occasion harry was surprised to see that he added four chairs two on either side of dumbledoresbut there are only two extra people harry said whys filch putting out four chairs who else is comingeh said ron vaguely he was still staring avidly at krumwhen all the students had entered the hall and settled down at their house tables the staff entered filing up to the top table and taking their seats last in line were professor dumbledore professor karkaroff and madame maxime when their headmistress appeared the pupils from beauxbatons leapt to their feet a few of the hogwarts students laughed the beauxbatons party appeared quite unembarrassed however and did not resume their seats until madame maxime had sat down on dumbledores lefthand side dumbledore remained standing and a silence fell over the great hallgood evening ladies and gentlemen ghosts and most particularly guests said dumbledore beaming around at the foreign students i have great pleasure in welcoming you all to hogwarts i hope and trust that your stay here will be both comfortable and enjoyableone of the beauxbatons girls still clutching a muffler around her head gave what was unmistakably a derisive laughno ones making you stay hermione whispered bristling at herthe tournament will be officially opened at the end of the feast said dumbledore i now invite you all to eat drink and make yourselves at homehe sat down and harry saw karkaroff lean forward at once and engage him in conversationthe plates in front of them filled with food as usual the houseelves in the kitchen seemed to have pulled out all the stops there was a greater variety of dishes in front of them than harry had ever seen including several that were definitely foreignwhats that said ron pointing at a large dish of some sort of shellfish stew that stood beside a large steakandkidney puddingbouillabaisse said hermionebless you said ronits french said hermione i had it on holiday summer before last its very niceill take your word for it said ron helping himself to black puddingthe great hall seemed somehow much more crowded than usual even though there were barely twenty additional students there perhaps it was because their differently colored uniforms stood out so clearly against the black of the hogwarts robes now that they had removed their furs the durmstrang students were revealed to be wearing robes of a deep bloodredhagrid sidled into the hall through a door behind the staff table twenty minutes after the start of the feast he slid into his seat at the end and waved at harry ron and hermione with a very heavily bandaged handskrewts doing all right hagrid harry calledthrivin hagrid called back happilyyeah ill just bet they are said ron quietly looks like theyve finally found a food they like doesnt it hagrids fingersat that moment a voice said excuse me are you wanting ze bouillabaisseit was the girl from beauxbatons who had laughed during dumbledores speech she had finally removed her muffler a long sheet of silveryblonde hair fell almost to her waist she had large deep blue eyes and very white even teethron went purple he stared up at her opened his mouth to reply but nothing came out except a faint gurgling noiseyeah have it said harry pushing the dish toward the girlyou ave finished wiz ityeah ron said breathlessly yeah it was excellentthe girl picked up the dish and carried it carefully off to the ravenclaw table ron was still goggling at the girl as though he had never seen one before harry started to laugh the sound seemed to jog ron back to his sensesshes a veela he said hoarsely to harryof course she isnt said hermione tartly i dont see anyone else gaping at her like an idiotbut she wasnt entirely right about that as the girl crossed the hall many boys heads turned and some of them seemed to have become temporarily speechless just like ronim telling you thats not a normal girl said ron leaning sideways so he could keep a clear view of her they dont make them like that at hogwartsthey make them okay at hogwarts said harry without thinking cho happened to be sitting only a few places away from the girl with the silvery hairwhen youve both put your eyes back in said hermione briskly youll be able to see whos just arrivedshe was pointing up at the staff table the two remaining empty seats had just been filled ludo bagman was now sitting on professor karkaroffs other side while mr crouch percys boss was next to madame maximewhat are they doing here said harry in surprisethey organized the triwizard tournament didnt they said hermione i suppose they wanted to be here to see it startwhen the second course arrived they noticed a number of unfamiliar desserts too ron examined an odd sort of pale blancmange closely then moved it carefully a few inches to his right so that it would be clearly visible from the ravenclaw table the girl who looked like a veela appeared to have eaten enough however and did not come over to get itonce the golden plates had been wiped clean dumbledore stood up again a pleasant sort of tension seemed to fill the hall now harry felt a slight thrill of excitement wondering what was coming several seats down from them fred and george were leaning forward staring at dumbledore with great concentrationthe moment has come said dumbledore smiling around at the sea of upturned faces the triwizard tournament is about to start i would like to say a few words of explanation before we bring in the casket the what harry mutteredron shruggedjust to clarify the procedure that we will be following this year but first let me introduce for those who do not know them mr bartemius crouch head of the department of international magical cooperation there was a smattering of polite applause and mr ludo bagman head of the department of magical games and sportsthere was a much louder round of applause for bagman than for crouch perhaps because of his fame as a beater or simply because he looked so much more likable he acknowledged it with a jovial wave of his hand bartemius crouch did not smile or wave when his name was announced remembering him in his neat suit at the quidditch world cup harry thought he looked strange in wizards robes his toothbrush mustache and severe parting looked very odd next to dumbledores long white hair and beardmr bagman and mr crouch have worked tirelessly over the last few months on the arrangements for the triwizard tournament dumbledore continued and they will be joining myself professor karkaroff and madame maxime on the panel that will judge the champions effortsat the mention of the word champions the attentiveness of the listening students seemed to sharpen perhaps dumbledore had noticed their sudden stillness for he smiled as he said the casket then if you please mr filchfilch who had been lurking unnoticed in a far corner of the hall now approached dumbledore carrying a great wooden chest encrusted with jewels it looked extremely old a murmur of excited interest rose from the watching students dennis creevey actually stood on his chair to see it properly but being so tiny his head hardly rose above anyone elsesthe instructions for the tasks the champions will face this year have already been examined by mr crouch and mr bagman said dumbledore as filch placed the chest carefully on the table before him and they have made the necessary arrangements for each challenge there will be three tasks spaced throughout the school year and they will test the champions in many different ways their magical prowess their daring their powers of deduction and of course their ability to cope with dangerat this last word the hall was filled with a silence so absolute that nobody seemed to be breathingas you know three champions compete in the tournament dumbledore went on calmly one from each of the participating schools they will be marked on how well they perform each of the tournament tasks and the champion with the highest total after task three will win the triwizard cup the champions will be chosen by an impartial selector the goblet of firedumbledore now took out his wand and tapped three times upon the top of the casket the lid creaked slowly open dumbledore reached inside it and pulled out a large roughly hewn wooden cup it would have been entirely unremarkable had it not been full to the brim with dancing bluewhite flamesdumbledore closed the casket and placed the goblet carefully on top of it where it would be clearly visible to everyone in the hallanybody wishing to submit themselves as champion must write their name and school clearly upon a slip of parchment and drop it into the goblet said dumbledore aspiring champions have twentyfour hours in which to put their names forward tomorrow night halloween the goblet will return the names of the three it has judged most worthy to represent their schools the goblet will be placed in the entrance hall tonight where it will be freely accessible to all those wishing to competeto ensure that no underage student yields to temptation said dumbledore i will be drawing an age line around the goblet of fire once it has been placed in the entrance hall nobody under the age of seventeen will be able to cross this linefinally i wish to impress upon any of you wishing to compete that this tournament is not to be entered into lightly once a champion has been selected by the goblet of fire he or she is obliged to see the tournament through to the end the placing of your name in the goblet constitutes a binding magical contract there can be no change of heart once you have become a champion please be very sure therefore that you are wholeheartedly prepared to play before you drop your name into the goblet now i think it is time for bed good night to you allan age line fred weasley said his eyes glinting as they all made their way across the hall to the doors into the entrance hall well that should be fooled by an aging potion shouldnt it and once your names in that goblet youre laughing it cant tell whether youre seventeen or notbut i dont think anyone under seventeen will stand a chance said hermione we just havent learned enough speak for yourself said george shortly youll try and get in wont you harryharry thought briefly of dumbledores insistence that nobody under seventeen should submit their name but then the wonderful picture of himself winning the triwizard tournament filled his mind again he wondered how angry dumbledore would be if someone younger than seventeen did find a way to get over the age linewhere is he said ron who wasnt listening to a word of this conversation but looking through the crowd to see what had become of krum dumbledore didnt say where the durmstrang people are sleeping did hebut this query was answered almost instantly they were level with the slytherin table now and karkaroff had just bustled up to his studentsback to the ship then he was saying viktor how are you feeling did you eat enough should i send for some mulled wine from the kitchensharry saw krum shake his head as he pulled his furs back on professor ivood like some vine said one of the other durmstrang boys hopefullyi wasnt offering it to you poliakoff snapped karkaroff his warmly paternal air vanishing in an instant i notice you have dribbled food all down the front of your robes again disgusting boy karkaroff turned and led his students toward the doors reaching them at exactly the same moment as harry ron and hermione harry stopped to let him walk through firstthank you said karkaroff carelessly glancing at him and then karkaroff froze he turned his head back to harry and stared at him as though he couldnt believe his eyes behind their headmaster the students from durmstrang came to a halt too karkaroffs eyes moved slowly up harrys face and fixed upon his scar the durmstrang students were staring curiously at harry too out of the corner of his eye harry saw comprehension dawn on a few of their faces the boy with food all down his front nudged the girl next to him and pointed openly at harrys foreheadyeah thats harry potter said a growling voice from behind themprofessor karkaroff spun around madeye moody was standing there leaning heavily on his staff his magical eye glaring unblinkingly at the durmstrang headmasterthe color drained from karkaroffs face as harry watched a terrible look of mingled fury and fear came over himyou he said staring at moody as though unsure he was really seeing himme said moody grimly and unless youve got anything to say to potter karkaroff you might want to move youre blocking the doorwayit was true half the students in the hall were now waiting behind them looking over one anothers shoulders to see what was causing the holdupwithout another word professor karkaroff swept his students away with him moody watched him until he was out of sight his magical eye fixed upon his back a look of intense dislike upon his mutilated faceas the next day was saturday most students would normally have breakfasted late harry ron and hermione however were not alone in rising much earlier than they usually did on weekends when they went down into the entrance hall they saw about twenty people milling around it some of them eating toast all examining the goblet of fire it had been placed in the center of the hall on the stool that normally bore the sorting hat a thin golden line had been traced on the floor forming a circle ten feet around it in every directionanyone put their name in yet ron asked a thirdyear girl eagerlyall the durmstrang lot she replied but i havent seen anyone from hogwarts yetbet some of them put it in last night after wed all gone to bed said harry i wouldve if it had been me wouldnt have wanted everyone watching what if the goblet just gobbed you right back out againsomeone laughed behind harry turning he saw fred george and lee jordan hurrying down the staircase all three of them looking extremely exciteddone it fred said in a triumphant whisper to harry ron and hermione just taken itwhat said ronthe aging potion dung brains said fredone drop each said george rubbing his hands together with glee we only need to be a few months olderwere going to split the thousand galleons between the three of us if one of us wins said lee grinning broadlyim not sure this is going to work you know said hermione warningly im sure dumbledore will have thought of thisfred george and lee ignored herready fred said to the other two quivering with excitement cmon then ill go first harry watched fascinated as fred pulled a slip of parchment out of his pocket bearing the words fred weasley hogwarts fred walked right up to the edge of the line and stood there rocking on his toes like a diver preparing for a fiftyfoot drop then with the eyes of every person in the entrance hall upon him he took a great breath and stepped over the linefor a split second harry thought it had worked george certainly thought so for he let out a yell of triumph and leapt after fred but next moment there was a loud sizzling sound and both twins were hurled out of the golden circle as though they had been thrown by an invisible shotputter they landed painfully ten feet away on the cold stone floor and to add insult to injury there was a loud popping noise and both of them sprouted identical long white beardsthe entrance hall rang with laughter even fred and george joined in once they had gotten to their feet and taken a good look at each others beardsi did warn you said a deep amused voice and everyone turned to see professor dumbledore coming out of the great hall he surveyed fred and george his eyes twinkling i suggest you both go up to madam pomfrey she is already tending to miss fawcett of ravenclaw and mr summers of hufflepuff both of whom decided to age themselves up a little too though i must say neither of their beards is anything like as fine as yoursfred and george set off for the hospital wing accompanied by lee who was howling with laughter and harry ron and hermione also chortling went in to breakfastthe decorations in the great hall had changed this morning as it was halloween a cloud of live bats was fluttering around the enchanted ceiling while hundreds of carved pumpkins leered from every corner harry led the way over to dean and seamus who were discussing those hogwarts students of seventeen or over who might be enteringtheres a rumor going around that warrington got up early and put his name in dean told harry that big bloke from slytherin who looks like a slothharry who had played quidditch against warrington shook his head in disgustwe cant have a slytherin championand all the hufflepuffs are talking about diggory said seamus contemptuously but i wouldnt have thought hed have wanted to risk his good lookslisten said hermione suddenlypeople were cheering out in the entrance hall they all swiveled around in their seats and saw angelina johnson coming into the hall grinning in an embarrassed sort of way a tall black girl who played chaser on the gryffindor quidditch team angelina came over to them sat down and said well ive done it just put my name inyoure kidding said ron looking impressedare you seventeen then asked harrycourse she is cant see a beard can you said roni had my birthday last week said angelinawell im glad someone from gryffindors entering said hermione i really hope you get it angelinathanks hermione said angelina smiling at heryeah better you than prettyboy diggory said seamus causing several hufflepuffs passing their table to scowl heavily at himwhatre we going to do today then ron asked harry and hermione when they had finished breakfast and were leaving the great hallwe havent been down to visit hagrid yet said harryokay said ron just as long as he doesnt ask us to donate a few fingers to the skrewtsa look of great excitement suddenly dawned on hermiones faceive just realized i havent asked hagrid to join spew yet she said brightly wait for me will you while i nip upstairs and get the badgeswhat is it with her said ron exasperated as hermione ran away up the marble staircasehey ron said harry suddenly its your friend the students from beauxbatons were coming through the front doors from the grounds among them the veelagirl those gathered around the goblet of fire stood back to let them pass watching eagerlymadame maxime entered the hall behind her students and organized them into a line one by one the beauxbatons students stepped across the age line and dropped their slips of parchment into the bluewhite flames as each name entered the fire it turned briefly red and emitted sparkswhat dyou reckonll happen to the ones who arent chosen ron muttered to harry as the veelagirl dropped her parchment into the goblet of fire reckon theyll go back to school or hang around to watch the tournamentdunno said harry hang around i suppose madame maximes staying to judge isnt shewhen all the beauxbatons students had submitted their names madame maxime led them back out of the hall and out onto the grounds againwhere are they sleeping then said ron moving toward the front doors and staring after thema loud rattling noise behind them announced hermiones reappearance with the box of s p ew badgesoh good hurry up said ron and he jumped down the stone steps keeping his eyes on the back of the veelagirl who was now halfway across the lawn with madame maximeas they neared hagrids cabin on the edge of the forbidden forest the mystery of the beauxbatons sleeping quarters was solved the gigantic powderblue carriage in which they had arrived had been parked two hundred yards from hagrids front door and the students were climbing back inside it the elephantine flying horses that had pulled the carriage were now grazing in a makeshift paddock alongside itharry knocked on hagrids door and fangs booming barks answered instantlybout time said hagrid when hed flung open the door thought you lotd forgotten where i liveweve been really busy hag hermione started to say but then she stopped dead looking up at hagrid apparently lost for wordshagrid was wearing his best and very horrible hairy brown suit plus a checked yellowandorange tie this wasnt the worst of it though he had evidently tried to tame his hair using large quantities of what appeared to be axle grease it was now slicked down into two bunches perhaps he had tried a ponytail like bills but found he had too much hair the look didnt really suit hagrid at all for a moment hermione goggled at him then obviously deciding not to comment she said erm where are the skrewtsout by the pumpkin patch said hagrid happily theyre gettin massive mus be nearly three foot long now ony trouble is theyve started killin each otheroh no really said hermione shooting a repressive look at ron who staring at hagrids odd hairstyle had just opened his mouth to say something about ityeah said hagrid sadly s okay though ive got em in separate boxes now still got abou twentywell thats lucky said ron hagrid missed the sarcasm hagrids cabin comprised a single room in one corner of which was a gigantic bed covered in a patchwork quilt a similarly enormous wooden table and chairs stood in front of the fire beneath the quantity of cured hams and dead birds hanging from the ceiling they sat down at the table while hagrid started to make tea and were soon immersed in yet more discussion of the triwizard tournament hagrid seemed quite as excited about it as they wereyou wait he said grinning you jus wait yer going ter see some stuff yehve never seen before firs task ah but im not supposed ter saygo on hagrid harry ron and hermione urged him but he just shook his head grinningi don want ter spoil it fer yeh said hagrid but its gonna be spectacular ill tell yeh that them championsre going ter have their work cut out never thought id live ter see the triwizard tournament played againthey ended up having lunch with hagrid though they didnt eat much hagrid had made what he said was a beef casserole but after hermione unearthed a large talon in hers she harry and ron rather lost their appetites however they enjoyed themselves trying to make hagrid tell them what the tasks in the tournament were going to be speculating which of the entrants were likely to be selected as champions and wondering whether fred and george were beardless yeta light rain had started to fall by midafternoon it was very cozy sitting by the fire listening to the gentle patter of the drops on the window watching hagrid darning his socks and arguing with hermione about houseelves for he flatly refused to join spew when she showed him her badgesitd be doin em an unkindness hermione he said gravely threading a massive bone needle with thick yellow yarn its in their nature ter look after humans thats what they like see yehd be makin em unhappy ter take away their work an insutin em if yeh tried ter pay embut harry set dobby free and he was over the moon about it said hermione and we heard hes asking for wages nowyeah well yeh get weirdos in every breed im not sayin there isnt the odd elf whod take freedom but yehll never persuade most of em ter do it no nothin doin hermionehermione looked very cross indeed and stuffed her box of badges back into her cloak pocketby half past five it was growing dark and ron harry and hermione decided it was time to get back up to the castle for the halloween feast and more important the announcement of the school championsill come with yeh said hagrid putting away his darning jus give us a sechagrid got up went across to the chest of drawers beside his bed and began searching for something inside it they didnt pay too much attention until a truly horrible smell reached their nostrils coughing ron said hagrid whats thateh said hagrid turning around with a large bottle in his hand don yeh like itis that aftershave said hermione in a slightly choked voiceer eau de cologne hagrid muttered he was blushingmaybe its a bit much he said gruffly ill go take it off hang onhe stumped out of the cabin and they saw him washing himself vigorously in the water barrel outside the windoweau de cologne said hermione in amazement hagridand whats with the hair and the suit said harry in an undertonelook said ron suddenly pointing out of the window hagrid had just straightened up and turned round if he had been blushing before it was nothing to what he was doing now getting to their feet very cautiously so that hagrid wouldnt spot them harry ron and hermione peered through the window and saw that madame maxime and the beauxbatons students had just emerged from their carriage clearly about to set off for the feast too they couldnt hear what hagrid was saying but he was talking to madame maxime with a rapt mistyeyed expression harry had only ever seen him wear once before when he had been looking at the baby dragon norberthes going up to the castle with her said hermione indignantly i thought he was waiting for uswithout so much as a backward glance at his cabin hagrid was trudging off up the grounds with madame maxime the beauxbatons students following in their wake jogging to keep up with their enormous strideshe fancies her said ron incredulously well if they end up having children theyll be setting a world record bet any baby of theirs would weigh about a tonthey let themselves out of the cabin and shut the door behind them it was surprisingly dark outside drawing their cloaks more closely around themselves they set off up the sloping lawnsooh its them look hermione whisperedthe durmstrang party was walking up toward the castle from the lake viktor krum was walking side by side with karkaroff and the other durmstrang students were straggling along behind them ron watched krum excitedly but krum did not look around as he reached the front doors a little ahead of hermione ron and harry and proceeded through themwhen they entered the candlelit great hall it was almost full the goblet of fire had been moved it was now standing in front of dumbledores empty chair at the teachers table fred and george cleanshaven again seemed to have taken their disappointment fairly wellhope its angelina said fred as harry ron and hermione sat downso do i said hermione breathlessly well well soon knowthe halloween feast seemed to take much longer than usual perhaps because it was their second feast in two days harry didnt seem to fancy the extravagantly prepared food as much as he would have normally like everyone else in the hall judging by the constantly craning necks the impatient expressions on every face the fidgeting and the standing up to see whether dumbledore had finished eating yet harry simply wanted the plates to clear and to hear who had been selected as championsat long last the golden plates returned to their original spotless state there was a sharp upswing in the level of noise within the hall which died away almost instantly as dumbledore got to his feet on either side of him professor karkaroff and madame maxime looked as tense and expectant as anyone ludo bagman was beaming and winking at various students mr crouch however looked quite uninterested almost boredwell the goblet is almost ready to make its decision said dumbledore i estimate that it requires one more minute now when the champions names are called i would ask them please to come up to the top of the hall walk along the staff table and go through into the next chamber he indicated the door behind the staff table where they will be receiving their first instructionshe took out his wand and gave a great sweeping wave with it at once all the candles except those inside the carved pumpkins were extinguished plunging them into a state of semidarkness the goblet of fire now shone more brightly than anything in the whole hall the sparkling bright blueywhiteness of the flames almost painful on the eyes everyone watched waiting a few people kept checking their watches any second lee jordan whispered two seats away from harrythe flames inside the goblet turned suddenly red again sparks began to fly from it next moment a tongue of flame shot into the air a charred piece of parchment fluttered out of it the whole room gaspeddumbledore caught the piece of parchment and held it at arms length so that he could read it by the light of the flames which had turned back to bluewhitethe champion for durmstrang he read in a strong clear voice will be viktor krumno surprises there yelled ron as a storm of applause and cheering swept the hall harry saw viktor krum rise from the slytherin table and slouch up toward dumbledore he turned right walked along the staff table and disappeared through the door into the next chamberbravo viktor boomed karkaroff so loudly that everyone could hear him even over all the applause knew you had it in youthe clapping and chatting died down now everyones attention was focused again on the goblet which seconds later turned red once more a second piece of parchment shot out of it propelled by the flamesthe champion for beauxbatons said dumbledore is fleur delacourits her ron harry shouted as the girl who so resembled a veela got gracefully to her feet shook back her sheet of silvery blonde hair and swept up between the ravenclaw and hufflepuff tablesoh look theyre all disappointed hermione said over the noise nodding toward the remainder of the beauxbatons party disappointed was a bit of an understatement harry thought two of the girls who had not been selected had dissolved into tears and were sobbing with their heads on their armswhen fleur delacour too had vanished into the side chamber silence fell again but this time it was a silence so stiff with excitement you could almost taste it the hogwarts champion nextand the goblet of fire turned red once more sparks showered out of it the tongue of flame shot high into the air and from its tip dumbledore pulled the third piece of parchmentthe hogwarts champion he called is cedric diggoryno said ron loudly but nobody heard him except harry the uproar from the next table was too great every single hufflepuff had jumped to his or her feet screaming and stamping as cedric made his way past them grinning broadly and headed off toward the chamber behind the teachers table indeed the applause for cedric went on so long that it was some time before dumbledore could make himself heard againexcellent dumbledore called happily as at last the tumult died down well we now have our three champions i am sure i can count upon all of you including the remaining students from beauxbatons and durmstrang to give your champions every ounce of support you can muster by cheering your champion on you will contribute in a very real but dumbledore suddenly stopped speaking and it was apparent to everybody what had distracted himthe fire in the goblet had just turned red again sparks were flying out of it a long flame shot suddenly into the air and borne upon it was another piece of parchmentautomatically it seemed dumbledore reached out a long hand and seized the parchment he held it out and stared at the name written upon it there was a long pause during which dumbledore stared at the slip in his hands and everyone in the room stared at dumbledore and then dumbledore cleared his throat and read out harry potterchapter seventeen the four championsharry sat there aware that every head in the great hall had turned to look at him he was stunned he felt numb he was surely dreaming he had not heard correctlythere was no applause a buzzing as though of angry bees was starting to fill the hall some students were standing up to get a better look at harry as he sat frozen in his seatup at the top table professor mcgonagall had got to her feet and swept past ludo bagman and professor karkaroff to whisper urgently to professor dumbledore who bent his ear toward her frowning slightlyharry turned to ron and hermione beyond them he saw the long gryffindor table all watching him openmouthedi didnt put my name in harry said blankly you know i didntboth of them stared just as blankly backat the top table professor dumbledore had straightened up nodding to professor mcgonagallharry potter he called again harry up here if you pleasego on hermione whispered giving harry a slight pushharry got to his feet trod on the hem of his robes and stumbled slightly he set off up the gap between the gryffindor and hufflepuff tables it felt like an immensely long walk the top table didnt seem to be getting any nearer at all and he could feel hundreds and hundreds of eyes upon him as though each were a searchlight the buzzing grew louder and louder after what seemed like an hour he was right in front of dumbledore feeling the stares of all the teachers upon himwell through the door harry said dumbledore he wasnt smilingharry moved off along the teachers table hagrid was seated right at the end he did not wink at harry or wave or give any of his usual signs of greeting he looked completely astonished and stared at harry as he passed like everyone else harry went through the door out of the great hall and found himself in a smaller room lined with paintings of witches and wizards a handsome fire was roaring in the fireplace opposite himthe faces in the portraits turned to look at him as he entered he saw a wizened witch flit out of the frame of her picture and into the one next to it which contained a wizard with a walrus mustache the wizened witch started whispering in his earviktor krum cedric diggory and fleur delacour were grouped around the fire they looked strangely impressive silhouetted against the flames krum hunchedup and brooding was leaning against the mantelpiece slightly apart from the other two cedric was standing with his hands behind his back staring into the fire fleur delacour looked around when harry walked in and threw back her sheet of long silvery hairwhat is it she said do zey want us back in ze hallshe thought he had come to deliver a message harry didnt know how to explain what had just happened he just stood there looking at the three champions it struck him how very tall all of them werethere was a sound of scurrying feet behind him and ludo bagman entered the room he took harry by the arm and led him forwardextraordinary he muttered squeezing harrys arm absolutely extraordinary gentlemen lady he added approaching the fireside and addressing the other three may i introduce incredible though it may seem the fourth triwizard championviktor krum straightened up his surly face darkened as he surveyed harry cedric looked nonplussed he looked from bagman to harry and back again as though sure he must have misheard what bagman had said fleur delacour however tossed her hair smiling and said oh vairy funny joke meester bagmanjoke bagman repeated bewildered no no not at all harrys name just came out of the goblet of firekrums thick eyebrows contracted slightly cedric was still looking politely bewildered fleur frownedbut evidently zair as been a mistake she said contemptuously to bagman e cannot compete e is too youngwell it is amazing said bagman rubbing his smooth chin and smiling down at harry but as you know the age restriction was only imposed this year as an extra safety measure and as his names come out of the goblet i mean i dont think there can be any ducking out at this stage its down in the rules youre obliged harry will just have to do the best he the door behind them opened again and a large group of people came in professor dumbledore followed closely by mr crouch professor karkaroff madame maxime professor mcgonagall and professor snape harry heard the buzzing of the hundreds of students on the other side of the wall before professor mcgonagall closed the doormadame maxime said fleur at once striding over to her headmistress zey are saying zat zis little boy is to compete alsosomewhere under harrys numb disbelief he felt a ripple of anger little boymadame maxime had drawn herself up to her full and considerable height the top of her handsome head brushed the candlefilled chandelier and her gigantic blacksatin bosom swelledwhat is ze meaning of zis dumblydorr she said imperiously id rather like to know that myself dumbledore said professor karkaroff he was wearing a steely smile and his blue eyes were like chips of ice two hogwarts champions i dont remember anyone telling me the host school is allowed two champions or have i not read the rules carefully enoughhe gave a short and nasty laughcest impossible said madame maxime whose enormous hand with its many superb opals was resting upon fleurs shoulder ogwarts cannot ave two champions it is most injustwe were under the impression that your age line would keep out younger contestants dumbledore said karkaroff his steely smile still in place though his eyes were colder than ever otherwise we would of course have brought along a wider selection of candidates from our own schoolsits no ones fault but potters karkaroff said snape softly his black eyes were alight with malice dont go blaming dumbledore for potters determination to break rules he has been crossing lines ever since he arrived here thank you severus said dumbledore firmly and snape went quiet though his eyes still glinted malevolently through his curtain of greasy black hairprofessor dumbledore was now looking down at harry who looked right back at him trying to discern the expression of the eyes behind the halfmoon spectaclesdid you put your name into the goblet of fire harry he asked calmlyno said harry he was very aware of everybody watching him closely snape made a soft noise of impatient disbelief in the shadowsdid you ask an older student to put it into the goblet of fire for you said professor dumbledore ignoring snapeno said harry vehementlyah but of course e is lying cried madame maxime snape was now shaking his head his lip curlinghe could not have crossed the age line said professor mcgonagall sharply i am sure we are all agreed on that dumblydorr must ave made a mistake wiz ze line said madame maxime shruggingit is possible of course said dumbledore politelydumbledore you know perfectly well you did not make a mistake said professor mcgonagall angrily really what nonsense harry could not have crossed the line himself and as professor dumbledore believes that he did not persuade an older student to do it for him im sure that should be good enough for everybody elseshe shot a very angry look at professor snapemr crouch mr bagman said karkaroff his voice unctuous once more you are our er objective judges surely you will agree that this is most irregularbagman wiped his round boyish face with his handkerchief and looked at mr crouch who was standing outside the circle of the firelight his face half hidden in shadow he looked slightly eerie the half darkness making him look much older giving him an almost skulllike appearance when he spoke however it was in his usual curt voicewe must follow the rules and the rules state clearly that those people whose names come out of the goblet of fire are bound to compete in the tournamentwell barty knows the rule book back to front said bagman beaming and turning back to karkaroff and madame maxime as though the matter was now closedi insist upon resubmitting the names of the rest of my students said karkaroff he had dropped his unctuous tone and his smile now his face wore a very ugly look indeed you will set up the goblet of fire once more and we will continue adding names until each school has two champions its only fair dumbledorebut karkaroff it doesnt work like that said bagman the goblet of fires just gone out it wont reignite until the start of the next tournament in which durmstrang will most certainly not be competing exploded karkaroff after all our meetings and negotiations and compromises i little expected something of this nature to occur i have half a mind to leave nowempty threat karkaroff growled a voice from near the door you cant leave your champion now hes got to compete theyve all got to compete binding magical contract like dumbledore said convenient ehmoody had just entered the room he limped toward the fire and with every right step he took there was a loud clunkconvenient said karkaroff im afraid i dont understand you moodyharry could tell he was trying to sound disdainful as though what moody was saying was barely worth his notice but his hands gave him away they had balled themselves into fistsdont you said moody quietly its very simple karkaroff someone put potters name in that goblet knowing hed have to compete if it came outevidently someone oo wished to give ogwarts two bites at ze apple said madame maximei quite agree madame maxime said karkaroff bowing to her i shall be lodging complaints with the ministry of magic and the international confederation of wizards if anyones got reason to complain its potter growled moody but funny thing i dont hear him saying a word why should e complain burst out fleur delacour stamping her foot e as ze chance to compete asnt e we ave all been oping to be chosen for weeks and weeks ze honor for our schools a thousand galleons in prize money zis is a chance many would die formaybe someones hoping potter is going to die for it said moody with the merest trace of a growlan extremely tense silence followed these words ludo bagman who was looking very anxious indeed bounced nervously up and down on his feet and said moody old man what a thing to saywe all know professor moody considers the morning wasted if he hasnt discovered six plots to murder him before lunchtime said karkaroff loudly apparently he is now teaching his students to fear assassination too an odd quality in a defense against the dark arts teacher dumbledore but no doubt you had your reasonsimagining things am i growled moody seeing things eh it was a skilled witch or wizard who put the boys name in that goblet ah what evidence is zere of zat said madame maxime throwing up her huge handsbecause they hoodwinked a very powerful magical object said moody it would have needed an exceptionally strong confundus charm to bamboozle that goblet into forgetting that only three schools compete in the tournament im guessing they submitted potters name under a fourth school to make sure he was the only one in his category you seem to have given this a great deal of thought moody said karkaroff coldly and a very ingenious theory it is though of course i heard you recently got it into your head that one of your birthday presents contained a cunningly disguised basilisk egg and smashed it to pieces before realizing it was a carriage clock so youll understand if we dont take you entirely seriously there are those wholl turn innocent occasions to their advantage moody retorted in a menacing voice its my job to think the way dark wizards do karkaroff as you ought to rememberalastor said dumbledore warningly harry wondered for a moment whom he was speaking to but then realized madeye could hardly be moodys real first name moody fell silent though still surveying karkaroff with satisfaction karkaroffs face was burninghow this situation arose we do not know said dumbledore speaking to everyone gathered in the room it seems to me however that we have no choice but to accept it both cedric and harry have been chosen to compete in the tournament this therefore they will do ah but dumblydorr my dear madame maxime if you have an alternative i would be delighted to hear itdumbledore waited but madame maxime did not speak she merely glared she wasnt the only one either snape looked furious karkaroff livid bagman however looked rather excitedwell shall we crack on then he said rubbing his hands together and smiling around the room got to give our champions their instructions havent we barty want to do the honorsmr crouch seemed to come out of a deep reverieyes he said instructions yes the first task he moved forward into the firelight close up harry thought he looked ill there were dark shadows beneath his eyes and a thin papery look about his wrinkled skin that had not been there at the quidditch world cupthe first task is designed to test your daring he told harry cedric fleur and viktor so we are not going to be telling you what it is courage in the face of the unknown is an important quality in a wizard very importantthe first task will take place on november the twentyfourth in front of the other students and the panel of judgesthe champions are not permitted to ask for or accept help of any kind from their teachers to complete the tasks in the tournament the champions will face the first challenge armed only with their wands they will receive information about the second task when the first is over owing to the demanding and timeconsuming nature of the tournament the champions are exempted from endofyear testsmr crouch turned to look at dumbledorei think thats all is it albusi think so said dumbledore who was looking at mr crouch with mild concern are you sure you wouldnt like to stay at hogwarts tonight bartyno dumbledore i must get back to the ministry said mr crouch it is a very busy very difficult time at the moment ive left young weatherby in charge very enthusiastic a little overenthusiastic if truth be told youll come and have a drink before you go at least said dumbledorecome on barry im staying said bagman brightly its all happening at hogwarts now you know much more exciting here than at the officei think not ludo said crouch with a touch of his old impatienceprofessor karkaroff madame maxime a nightcap said dumbledorebut madame maxime had already put her arm around fleurs shoulders and was leading her swiftly out of the room harry could hear them both talking very fast in french as they went off into the great hall karkaroff beckoned to krum and they too exited though in silenceharry cedric i suggest you go up to bed said dumbledore smiling at both of them i am sure gryffindor and hufflepuff are waiting to celebrate with you and it would be a shame to deprive them of this excellent excuse to make a great deal of mess and noiseharry glanced at cedric who nodded and they left togetherthe great hall was deserted now the candles had burned low giving the jagged smiles of the pumpkins an eerie flickering qualityso said cedric with a slight smile were playing against each other againi spose said harry he really couldnt think of anything to say the inside of his head seemed to be in complete disarray as though his brain had been ransackedso tell me said cedric as they reached the entrance hall which was now lit only by torches in the absence of the goblet of fire how did you get your name ini didnt said harry staring up at him i didnt put it in i was telling the truthah okay said cedric harry could tell cedric didnt believe him well see you theninstead of going up the marble staircase cedric headed for a door to its right harry stood listening to him going down the stone steps beyond it then slowly he started to climb the marble oneswas anyone except ron and hermione going to believe him or would they all think hed put himself in for the tournament yet how could anyone think that when he was facing competitors whod had three years more magical education than he had when he was now facing tasks that not only sounded very dangerous but which were to be performed in front of hundreds of people yes hed thought about it hed fantasized about it but it had been a joke really an idle sort of dream hed never really seriously considered entering but someone else had considered it someone else had wanted him in the tournament and had made sure he was entered why to give him a treat he didnt think so somehowto see him make a fool of himself well they were likely to get their wish but to get him killedwas moody just being his usual paranoid self couldnt someone have put harrys name in the goblet as a trick a practical joke did anyone really want him deadharry was able to answer that at once yes someone wanted him dead someone had wanted him dead ever since he had been a year old lord voldemort but how could voldemort have ensured that harrys name got into the goblet of fire voldemort was supposed to be far away in some distant country in hiding alone feeble and powerlessyet in that dream he had had just before he had awoken with his scar hurting voldemort had not been alone he had been talking to wormtail plotting harrys murderharry got a shock to find himself facing the fat lady already he had barely noticed where his feet were carrying him it was also a surprise to see that she was not alone in her frame the wizened witch who had flitted into her neighbors painting when he had joined the champions downstairs was now sitting smugly beside the fat lady she must have dashed through every picture lining seven staircases to reach here before him both she and the fat lady were looking down at him with the keenest interestwell well well said the fat lady violets just told me everything whos just been chosen as school champion thenbalderdash said harry dullyit most certainly isnt said the pale witch indignantlyno no vi its the password said the fat lady soothingly and she swung forward on her hinges to let harry into the common roomthe blast of noise that met harrys ears when the portrait opened almost knocked him backward next thing he knew he was being wrenched inside the common room by about a dozen pairs of hands and was facing the whole of gryffindor house all of whom were screaming applauding and whistlingyou shouldve told us youd entered bellowed fred he looked half annoyed half deeply impressedhow did you do it without getting a beard brilliant roared georgei didnt harry said i dont know how but angelina had now swooped down upon him oh if it couldnt be me at least its a gryffindor youll be able to pay back diggory for that last quidditch match harry shrieked katie bell another of the gryffindor chasersweve got food harry come and have some im not hungry i had enough at the feast but nobody wanted to hear that he wasnt hungry nobody wanted to hear that he hadnt put his name in the goblet not one single person seemed to have noticed that he wasnt at all in the mood to celebrate lee jordan had unearthed a gryffindor banner from somewhere and he insisted on draping it around harry like a cloak harry couldnt get away whenever he tried to sidle over to the staircase up to the dormitories the crowd around him closed ranks forcing another butterbeer on him stuffing crisps and peanuts into his hands everyone wanted to know how he had done it how he had tricked dumbledores age line and managed to get his name into the gobleti didnt he said over and over again i dont know how it happenedbut for all the notice anyone took he might just as well not have answered at allim tired he bellowed finally after nearly half an hour no seriously george im going to bed he wanted more than anything to find ron and hermione to find a bit of sanity but neither of them seemed to be in the common room insisting that he needed to sleep and almost flattening the little creevey brothers as they attempted to waylay him at the foot of the stairs harry managed to shake everyone off and climb up to the dormitory as fast as he couldto his great relief he found ron was lying on his bed in the otherwise empty dormitory still fully dressed he looked up when harry slammed the door behind himwhereve you been harry saidoh hello said ronhe was grinning but it was a very odd strained sort of grin harry suddenly became aware that he was still wearing the scarlet gryffindor banner that lee had tied around him he hastened to take it off but it was knotted very tightly ron lay on the bed without moving watching harry struggle to remove itso he said when harry had finally removed the banner and thrown it into a corner congratulationswhat dyou mean congratulations said harry staring at ron there was definitely something wrong with the way ron was smiling it was more like a grimacewell no one else got across the age line said ron not even fred and george what did you use the invisibility cloakthe invisibility cloak wouldnt have got me over that line said harry slowlyoh right said ron i thought you mightve told me if it was the cloak because it wouldve covered both of us wouldnt it but you found another way did youlisten said harry i didnt put my name in that goblet someone else mustve done itron raised his eyebrowswhat would they do that fori dunno said harry he felt it would sound very melodramatic to say to kill merons eyebrows rose so high that they were in danger of disappearing into his hairits okay you know you can tell me the truth he said if you dont want everyone else to know fine but i dont know why youre bothering to lie you didnt get into trouble for it did you that friend of the fat ladys that violet shes already told us all dumbledores letting you enter a thousand galleons prize money eh and you dont have to do endofyear tests either i didnt put my name in that goblet said harry starting to feel angryyeah okay said ron in exactly the same sceptical tone as cedric only you said this morning youd have done it last night and no one wouldve seen you im not stupid you knowyoure doing a really good impression of it harry snappedyeah said ron and there was no trace of a grin forced or otherwise on his face now you want to get to bed harry i expect youll need to be up early tomorrow for a photocall or somethinghe wrenched the hangings shut around his fourposter leaving harry standing there by the door staring at the dark red velvet curtains now hiding one of the few people he had been sure would believe himchapter eighteen the weighing of the wandswhen harry woke up on sunday morning it took him a moment to remember why he felt so miserable and worried then the memory of the previous night rolled over him he sat up and ripped back the curtains of his own fourposter intending to talk to ron to force ron to believe him only to find that rons bed was empty he had obviously gone down to breakfastharry dressed and went down the spiral staircase into the common room the moment he appeared the people who had already finished breakfast broke into applause again the prospect of going down into the great hall and facing the rest of the gryffindors all treating him like some sort of hero was not inviting it was that however or stay here and allow himself to be cornered by the creevey brothers who were both beckoning frantically to him to join them he walked resolutely over to the portrait hole pushed it open climbed out of it and found himself facetoface with hermionehello she said holding up a stack of toast which she was carrying in a napkin i brought you this want to go for a walkgood idea said harry gratefullythey went downstairs crossed the entrance hall quickly without looking in at the great hall and were soon striding across the lawn toward the lake where the durmstrang ship was moored reflected blackly in the water it was a chilly morning and they kept moving munching their toast as harry told hermione exactly what had happened after he had left the gryffindor table the night before to his immense relief hermione accepted his story without questionwell of course i knew you hadnt entered yourself she said when hed finished telling her about the scene in the chamber off the hall the look on your face when dumbledore read out your name but the question is who did put it in because moodys right harry i dont think any student could have done it theyd never be able to fool the goblet or get over dumbledores have you seen ron harry interruptedhermione hesitatederm yes he was at breakfast she saiddoes he still think i entered myselfwell no i dont think so not really said hermione awkwardlywhats that supposed to mean not reallyoh harry isnt it obvious hermione said despairingly hes jealousjealous harry said incredulously jealous of what he wants to make a prat of himself in front of the whole school does helook said hermione patiently its always you who gets all the attention you know it is i know its not your fault she added quickly seeing harry open his mouth furiously i know you dont ask for it but well you know rons got all those brothers to compete against at home and youre his best friend and youre really famous hes always shunted to one side whenever people see you and he puts up with it and he never mentions it but i suppose this is just one time too many great said harry bitterly really great tell him from me ill swap any time he wants tell him from me hes welcome to it people gawping at my forehead everywhere i go im not teiling him anything hermione said shortly tell him yourself its the only way to sort this outim not running around after him trying to make him grow up harry said so loudly that several owls in a nearby tree took flight in alarm maybe hell believe im not enjoying myself once ive got my neck broken or thats not funny said hermione quietly thats not funny at all she looked extremely anxious harry ive been thinking you know what weve got to do dont you straight away the moment we get back to the castleyeah give ron a good kick up the write to sirius youve got to tell him whats happened he asked you to keep him posted on everything thats going on at hogwarts its almost as if he expected something like this to happen i brought some parchment and a quill out with me come off it said harry looking around to check that they couldnt be overheard but the grounds were quite deserted he came back to the country just because my scar twinged hell probably come bursting right into the castle if i tell him someones entered me in the triwizard tournament hed want you to tell him said hermione sternly hes going to find out anywayhowharry this isnt going to be kept quiet said hermione very seriously this tournaments famous and youre famous ill be really surprised if there isnt anything in the daily prophet about you competing youre already in half the books about youknowwho you know and sirius would rather hear it from you i know he wouldokay okay ill write to him said harry throwing his last piece of toast into the lake they both stood and watched it floating there for a moment before a large tentacle rose out of the water and scooped it beneath the surface then they returned to the castlewhose owl am i going to use harry said as they climbed the stairs he told me not to use hedwig againask ron if you can borrow im not asking ron for anything harry said flatlywell borrow one of the school owls then anyone can use them said hermionethey went up to the owlery hermione gave harry a piece of parchment a quill and a bottle of ink then strolled around the long lines of perches looking at all the different owls while harry sat down against a wall and wrote his letterdear siriusyou told me to keep you posted on whats happening at hogwarts so here goes i dont know if youve heard but the triwizard tournaments happening this year and on saturday night i got picked as a fourth champion i dont who put my name in the goblet of fire because i didnt the other hogwarts champion is cedric diggory from hufflepuffhe paused at this point thinking he had an urge to say something about the large weight of anxiety that seemed to have settled inside his chest since last night but he couldnt think how to translate this into words so he simply dipped his quill back into the ink bottle and wrotehope youre okay and buckbeak harry finished he told hermione getting to his feet and brushing straw off his robes at this hedwig fluttered down onto his shoulder and held out her legi cant use you harry told her looking around for the school owls ive got to use one of thesehedwig gave a very loud hoot and took off so suddenly that her talons cut into his shoulder she kept her back to harry all the time he was tying his letter to the leg of a large barn owl when the barn owl had flown off harry reached out to stroke hedwig but she clicked her beak furiously and soared up into the rafters out of reachfirst ron then you harry said angrily this isnt my faultif harry had thought that matters would improve once everyone got used to the idea of him being champion the following day showed him how mistaken he was he could no longer avoid the rest of the school once he was back at lessons and it was clear that the rest of the school just like the gryffindors thought harry had entered himself for the tournament unlike the gryffindors however they did not seem impressedthe hufflepuffs who were usually on excellent terms with the gryffindors had turned remarkably cold toward the whole lot of them one herbology lesson was enough to demonstrate this it was plain that the hufflepuffs felt that harry had stolen their champions glory a feeling exacerbated perhaps by the fact that hufflepuff house very rarely got any glory and that cedric was one of the few who had ever given them any having beaten gryffindor once at quidditch ernie macmillan and justin finchfletchley with whom harry normally got on very well did not talk to him even though they were repotting bouncing bulbs at the same tray though they did laugh rather unpleasantly when one of the bouncing bulbs wriggled free from harrys grip and smacked him hard in the face ron wasnt talking to harry either hermione sat between them making very forced conversation but though both answered her normally they avoided making eye contact with each other harry thought even professor sprout seemed distant with him but then she was head of hufflepuff househe would have been looking forward to seeing hagrid under normal circumstances but care of magical creatures meant seeing the slytherins too the first time he would come facetoface with them since becoming championpredictably malfoy arrived at hagrids cabin with his familiar sneer firmly in placeah look boys its the champion he said to crabbe and goyle the moment he got within earshot of harry got your autograph books better get a signature now because i doubt hes going to be around much longer half the triwizard champions have died how long dyou reckon youre going to last potter ten minutes into the first tasks my betcrabbe and goyle guffawed sycophantically but malfoy had to stop there because hagrid emerged from the back of his cabin balancing a teetering tower of crates each containing a very large blastended skrewt to the classs horror hagrid proceeded to explain that the reason the skrewts had been killing one another was an excess of pentup energy and that the solution would be for each student to fix a leash on a skrewt and take it for a short walk the only good thing about this plan was that it distracted malfoy completelytake this thing for a walk he repeated in disgust staring into one of the boxes and where exactly are we supposed to fix the leash around the sting the blasting end or the suckerroun the middle said hagrid demonstrating er yeh might want ter put on yer dragonhide gloves jus as an extra precaution like harry you come here an help me with this big onehagrids real intention however was totalk to harry away from the rest of the class he waited until everyone else had set off with their skrewts then turned to harry and said very seriously so yer competin harry in the tournament school championone of the champions harry corrected himhagrids beetleblack eyes looked very anxious under his wild eyebrowsno idea who put yeh in fer it harryyou believe i didnt do it then said harry concealing with difficulty the rush of gratitude he felt at hagrids wordscourse i do hagrid grunted yeh say it wasn you an i believe yeh an dumbledore believes yer an allwish i knew who did do it said harry bitterlythe pair of them looked out over the lawn the class was widely scattered now and all in great difficulty the skrewts were now over three feet long and extremely powerful no longer shellless and colorless they had developed a kind of thick grayish shiny armor they looked like a cross between giant scorpions and elongated crabs but still without recognizable heads or eyes they had become immensely strong and very hard to controllook like theyre havin fun don they hagrid said happily harry assumed he was talking about the skrewts because his classmates certainly werent every now and then with an alarming bang one of the skrewts ends would explode causing it to shoot forward several yards and more than one person was being dragged along on their stomach trying desperately to get back on their feetah i don know harry hagrid sighed suddenly looking back down at him with a worried expression on his face school champion everythin seems ter happen ter you doesn itharry didnt answer yes everything did seem to happen to him that was more or less what hermione had said as they had walked around the lake and that was the reason according to her that ron was no longer talking to himthe next few days were some of harrys worst at hogwarts the closest he had ever come to feeling like this had been during those months in his second year when a large part of the school had suspected him of attacking his fellow students but ron had been on his side then he thought he could have coped with the rest of the schools behavior if he could just have had ron back as a friend but he wasnt going to try and persuade ron to talk to him if ron didnt want to nevertheless it was lonely with dislike pouring in on him from all sideshe could understand the hufflepuffs attitude even if he didnt like it they had their own champion to support he expected nothing less than vicious insults from the slytherins he was highly unpopular there and always had been because he had helped gryffindor beat them so often both at quidditch and in the interhouse championship but he had hoped the ravenclaws might have found it in their hearts to support him as much as cedric he was wrong however most ravenclaws seemed to think that he had been desperate to earn himself a bit more fame by tricking the goblet into accepting his namethen there was the fact that cedric looked the part of a champion so much more than he did exceptionally handsome with his straight nose dark hair and gray eyes it was hard to say who was receiving more admiration these days cedric or viktor krum harry actually saw the same sixthyear girls who had been so keen to get krums autograph begging cedric to sign their school bags one lunchtimemeanwhile there was no reply from sirius hedwig was refusing to come anywhere near him professor trelawney was predicting his death with even more certainty than usual and he did so badly at summoning charms in professor flitwicks class that he was given extra homework the only person to get any apart from nevilleits really not that difficult harry hermione tried to reassure him as they left flitwicks class she had been making objects zoom across the room to her all lesson as though she were some sort of weird magnet for board dusters wastepaper baskets and lunascopes you just werent concentrating properly wonder why that was said harry darkly as cedric diggory walked past surrounded by a large group of simpering girls all of whom looked at harry as though he were a particularly large blastended skrewt still never mind eh double potions to look forward to this afternoon double potions was always a horrible experience but these days it was nothing short of torture being shut in a dungeon for an hour and a half with snape and the slytherins all of whom seemed determined to punish harry as much as possible for daring to become school champion was about the most unpleasant thing harry could imagine he had already struggled through one fridays worth with hermione sitting next to him intoning ignore them ignore them ignore them under her breath and he couldnt see why today should be any betterwhen he and hermione arrived at snapes dungeon after lunch they found the slytherins waiting outside each and every one of them wearing a large badge on the front of his or her robes for one wild moment harry thought they were spew badges then he saw that they all bore the same message in luminous red letters that burnt brightly in the dimly lit underground passagesupport cedric diggorythe real hogwarts championlike them potter said malfoy loudly as harry approached and this isnt all they do lookhe pressed his badge into his chest and the message upon it vanished to be replaced by another one which glowed greenpotter stinksthe slytherins howled with laughter each of them pressed their badges too until the message potter stinks was shining brightly all around harry he felt the heat rise in his face and neckoh very funny hermione said sarcastically to pansy parkinson and her gang of slytherin girls who were laughing harder than anyone really wittyron was standing against the wall with dean and seamus he wasnt laughing but he wasnt sticking up for harry eitherwant one granger said malfoy holding out a badge to hermione ive got loads but dont touch my hand now ive just washed it you see dont want a mudblood sliming it upsome of the anger harry had been feeling for days and days seemed to burst through a dam in his chest he had reached for his wand before hed thought what he was doing people all around them scrambled out of the way backing down the corridorharry hermione said warninglygo on then potter malfoy said quietly drawing out his own wand moodys not here to look after you now do it if youve got the guts for a split second they looked into each others eyes then at exactly the same time both actedfunnunculus harry yelleddensaugeo screamed malfoy jets of light shot from both wands hit each other in midair and ricocheted off at angles harrys hit goyle in the face and malfoys hit hermione goyle bellowed and put his hands to his nose where great ugly boils were springing up hermione whimpering in panic was clutching her mouthhermioneron had hurried forward to see what was wrong with her harry turned and saw ron dragging hermiones hand away from her face it wasnt a pretty sight hermiones front teeth already larger than average were now growing at an alarming rate she was looking more and more like a beaver as her teeth elongated past her bottom lip toward her chin panicstricken she felt them and let out a terrified cryand what is all this noise about said a soft deadly voicesnape had arrived the slytherins clamored to give their explanations snape pointed a long yellow finger at malfoy and said explainpotter attacked me sir we attacked each other at the same time harry shouted and he hit goyle look snape examined goyle whose face now resembled something that would have been at home in a book on poisonous fungihospital wing goyle snape said calmlymalfoy got hermione ron said lookhe forced hermione to show snape her teeth she was doing her best to hide them with her hands though this was difficult as they had now grown down past her collar pansy parkinson and the other slytherin girls were doubled up with silent giggles pointing at hermione from behind snapes backsnape looked coldly at hermione then said i see no differencehermione let out a whimper her eyes filled with tears she turned on her heel and ran ran all the way up the corridor and out of sightit was lucky perhaps that both harry and ron started shouting at snape at the same time lucky their voices echoed so much in the stone corridor for in the confused din it was impossible for him to hear exactly what they were calling him he got the gist howeverlets see he said in his silkiest voice fifty points from gryffindor and a detention each for potter and weasley now get inside or itll be a weeks worth of detentionsharrys ears were ringing the injustice of it made him want to curse snape into a thousand slimy pieces he passed snape walked with ron to the back of the dungeon and slammed his bag down onto the table ron was shaking with anger too for a moment it felt as though everything was back to normal between them but then ron turned and sat down with dean and seamus instead leaving harry alone at his table on the other side of the dungeon malfoy turned his back on snape and pressed his badge smirking potter stinks flashed once more across the roomharry sat there staring at snape as the lesson began picturing horrific things happening to him if only he knew how to do the cruciatus curse hed have snape flat on his back like that spider jerking and twitchingantidotes said snape looking around at them all his cold black eyes glittering unpleasantly you should all have prepared your recipes now i want you to brew them carefully and then we will be selecting someone on whom to test one snapes eyes met harrys and harry knew what was coming snape was going to poison him harry imagined picking up his cauldron and sprinting to the front of the class and bringing it down on snapes greasy head and then a knock on the dungeon door burst in on harrys thoughtsit was colin creevey he edged into the room beaming at harry and walked up to snapes desk at the front of the roomyes said snape curtlyplease sir im supposed to take harry potter upstairs snape stared down his hooked nose at colin whose smile faded from his eager facepotter has another hour of potions to complete said snape coldly he will come upstairs when this class is finishedcolin went pinksir sir mr bagman wants him he said nervously all the champions have got to go i think they want to take photographs harry would have given anything he owned to have stopped colin saying those last few words he chanced half a glance at ron but ron was staring determinedly at the ceilingvery well very well snape snapped potter leave your things here i want you back down here later to test your antidoteplease sir hes got to take his things with him squeaked cohn all the championsvery well said snape potter take your bag and get out of my sightharry swung his bag over his shoulder got up and headed for the door as he walked through the slytherin desks potter stinks flashed at him from every directionits amazing isnt it harry said colin starting to speak the moment harry had closed the dungeon door behind him isnt it though you being championyeah really amazing said harry heavily as they set off toward the steps into the entrance hall what do they want photos for colinthe daily prophet i thinkgreat said harry dully exactly what i need more publicitygood luck said colin when they had reached the right room harry knocked on the door and enteredhe was in a fairly small classroom most of the desks had been pushed away to the back of the room leaving a large space in the middle three of them however had been placed endtoend in front of the blackboard and covered with a long length of velvet five chairs had been set behind the velvetcovered desks and ludo bagman was sitting in one of them talking to a witch harry had never seen before who was wearing magenta robesviktor krum was standing moodily in a corner as usual and not talking to anybody cedric and fheur were in conversation fheur looked a good deal happier than harry had seen her so far she kept throwing back her head so that her long silvery hair caught the light a paunchy man holding a large black camera that was smoking slightly was watching fleur out of the corner of his eyebagman suddenly spotted harry got up quickly and bounded forwardah here he is champion number four in you come harry in you come nothing to worry about its just the wand weighing ceremony the rest of the judges will be here in a moment wand weighing harry repeated nervouslywe have to check that your wands are fully functional no problems you know as theyre your most important tools in the tasks ahead said bagman the experts upstairs now with dumbledore and then theres going to be a little photo shoot this is rita skeeter he added gesturing toward the witch in magenta robes shes doing a small piece on the tournament for the daily prophet maybe not that small ludo said rita skeeter her eyes on harryher hair was set in elaborate and curiously rigid curls that contrasted oddly with her heavyjawed face she wore jeweled spectacles the thick fingers clutching her crocodileskin handbag ended in twoinch nails painted crimsoni wonder if i could have a little word with harry before we start she said to bagman but still gazing fixedly at harry the youngest champion you know to add a bit of colorcertainly cried bagman that is if harry has no objectioner said harrylovely said rita skeeter and in a second her scarlettaloned fingers had harrys upper arm in a surprisingly strong grip and she was steering him out of the room again and opening a nearby doorwe dont want to be in there with all that noise she said lets see ah yes this is nice and cozyit was a broom cupboard harry stared at hercome along dear thats right lovely said rita skeeter again perching herself precariously upon an upturned bucket pushing harry down onto a cardboard box and closing the door throwing them into darkness lets see now she unsnapped her crocodileskin handbag and pulled out a handful of candles which she lit with a wave of her wand and magicked into midair so that they could see what they were doingyou wont mind harry if i use a quickquotes quill it leaves me free to talk to you normally a what said harryrita skeeters smile widened harry counted three gold teeth she reached again into her crocodile bag and drew out a long acidgreen quill and a roll of parchment which she stretched out between them on a crate of mrs skowers allpurpose magical mess remover she put the tip of the green quill into her mouth sucked it for a moment with apparent relish then placed it upright on the parchment where it stood balanced on its point quivering slightlytesting my name is rita skeeter daily prophet reporterharry hooked down quickly at the quill the moment rita skeeter had spoken the green quill had started to scribble skidding across the parchmentattractive blonde rita skeeter fortythree whos savage quill has punctured many inflated reputations lovely said rita skeeter yet again and she ripped the top piece of parchment off crumpled it up and stuffed it into her handbag now she leaned toward harry and said so harry what made you decide to enter the triwizard tournamenter said harry again but he was distracted by the quill even though he wasnt speaking it was dashing across the parchment and in its wake he could make out a fresh sentencean ugly scar souvenier of a tragic past disfigures the otherwise charming face of harry potter whose eyes ignore the quill harry said rita skeeter firmly reluctantly harry looked up at her instead now why did you decide to enter the tournament harryi didnt said harry i dont know how my name got into the goblet of fire i didnt put it in thererita skeeter raised one heavily penciled eyebrowcome now harry theres no need to be scared of getting into trouble we all know you shouldnt really have entered at all but dont worry about that our readers hove a rebelbut i didnt enter harry repeated i dont know who how do you feel about the tasks ahead said rita skeeter excited nervousi havent really thought yeah nervous i suppose said harry his insides squirmed uncomfortably as he spokechampions have died in the past havent they said rita skeeter briskly have you thought about that at allwell they say its going to be a lot safer this year said harrythe quill whizzed across the parchment between them back and forward as though it were skatingof course youve looked death in the face before havent you said rita skeeter watching him closely how would you say thats affected youer said harry yet againdo you think that the trauma in your past might have made you keen to prove yourself to live up to your name do you think that perhaps you were tempted to enter the triwizard tournament because i didnt enter said harry starting to feel irritated can you remember your parents at all said rita skeeter talking over himno said harryhow do you think theyd feel if they knew you were competing in the triwizard tournament proud worried angryharry was feeling really annoyed now how on earth was he to know how his parents would feel if they were alive he could feel rita skeeter watching him very intently frowning he avoided her gaze and hooked down at words the quill had just writtentears fill those startlingly green eyes as our conversation turns to the parents he can barely rememberi have not got tears in my eyes said harry loudlybefore rita skeeter could say a word the door of the broom cupboard was pulled open harry looked around blinking in the bright light albus dumbledore stood there looking down at both of them squashed into the cupboarddumbledore cried rita skeeter with every appearance of delight but harry noticed that her quill and the parchment had suddenly vanished from the box of magical mess remover and ritas clawed fingers were hastily snapping shut the clasp of her crocodileskin bag how are you she said standing up and holding out one of her large mannish hands to dumbledore i hope you saw my piece over the summer about the international confederation of wizards conferenceenchantingly nasty said dumbledore his eyes twinkling i particularly enjoyed your description of me as an obsolete dingbatrita skeeter didnt look remotely abashedi was just making the point that some of your ideas are a little oldfashioned dumbhedore and that many wizards in the street i will be delighted to hear the reasoning behind the rudeness rita said dumbledore with a courteous bow and a smile but im afraid we will have to discuss the matter later the weighing of the wands is about to start and it cannot take place if one of our champions is hidden in a broom cupboardvery glad to get away from rita skeeter harry hurried back into the room the other champions were now sitting in chairs near the door and he sat down quickly next to cedric hooking up at the velvetcovered table where four of the five judges were now sitting professor karkaroff madame maxime mr crouch and ludo bagman rita skeeter settled herself down in a corner harry saw her slip the parchment out of her bag again spread it on her knee suck the end of the quickquotes quill and place it once more on the parchmentmay i introduce mr ollivander said dumbledore taking his place at the judges table and talking to the champions he will be checking your wands to ensure that they are in good condition before the tournamentharry hooked around and with a jolt of surprise saw an old wizard with large pale eyes standing quietly by the window harry had met mr ollivander before he was the wandmaker from whom harry had bought his own wand over three years ago in diagon alleymademoiselle delacour could we have you first please said mr ollivander stepping into the empty space in the middle of the roomfleur delacour swept over to mr olhivander and handed him her wandhmm he saidhe twirled the wand between his long fingers like a baton and it emitted a number of pink and gold sparks then he held it chose to his eyes and examined it carefullyyes he said quietly nine and a half inches inflexible rosewood and containing dear me an air from ze ead of a veela said fleur one of my grandmuzzersso fleur was part veela thought harry making a mental note to tell ron then he remembered that ron wasnt speaking to himyes said mr ollivander yes ive never used veela hair myself of course i find it makes for rather temperamental wandshowever to each his own and if this suits youmr ollivander ran his fingers along the wand apparently checking for scratches or bumps then he muttered orchideous and a bunch of flowers burst from the wand tipvery well very well its in fine working order said mr ollivander scooping up the flowers and handing them to fleur with her wand mr diggory you nextfleur glided back to her seat smiling at cedric as he passed her ah now this is one of mine isnt it said mr ollivander with much more enthusiasm as cedric handed over his wand yes i remember it well containing a single hair from the tail of a particularly fine male unicorn must have been seventeen hands nearly gored me with his horn after i plucked his tail twelve and a quarter inches ash pleasantly springy its in fine conditionyou treat it regularlypolished it last night said cedric grinningharry hooked down at his own wand he could see finger marks all over it he gathered a fistful of robe from his knee and tried to rub it clean surreptitiously several gold sparks shot out of the end of it fleur delacour gave him a very patronizing look and he desistedmr ollivander sent a stream of silver smoke rings across the room from the tip of cedrics wand pronounced himself satisfied and then said mr krum if you pleaseviktor krum got up and slouched roundshouldered and duckfooted toward mr ollivander he thrust out his wand and stood scowling with his hands in the pockets of his robeshmm said mr olhivander this is a gregorovitch creation unless im much mistaken a fine wandmaker though the styling is never quite what i however he lifted the wand and examined it minutely turning it over and over before his eyesyes hornbeam and dragon heartstring he shot at krum who nodded rather thicker than one usually sees quite rigid ten and a quarter inches avisthe hornbeam wand let off a blast hike a gun and a number of small twittering birds flew out of the end and through the open window into the watery sunlightgood said mr ollivander handing krum back his wand which leaves mr potterharry got to his feet and walked past krum to mr ollivander he handed over his wandaaaah yes said mr ohlivander his pale eyes suddenly gleaming yes yes yes how well i rememberharry could remember too he could remember it as though it had happened yesterdayfour summers ago on his eleventh birthday he had entered mr ollivanders shop with hagrid to buy a wand mr ollivander had taken his measurements and then started handing him wands to try harry had waved what felt like every wand in the shop until at last he had found the one that suited him this one which was made of holly eleven inches long and contained a single feather from the tail of a phoenix mr ollivander had been very surprised that harry had been so compatible with this wand curious he had said curious and not until harry asked what was curious had mr olhivander explained that the phoenix feather in harrys wand had come from the same bird that had supplied the core of lord voldemortsharry had never shared this piece of information with anybody he was very fond of his wand and as far as he was concerned its relation to voldemorts wand was something it couldnt help rather as he couldnt help being related to aunt petunia however he really hoped that mr ollivander wasnt about to tell the room about it he had a funny feeling rita skeeters quickquotes quill might just explode with excitement if he didmr ollivander spent much longer examining harrys wand than anyone elses eventually however he made a fountain of wine shoot out of it and handed it back to harry announcing that it was still in perfect conditionthank you all said dumbledore standing up at the judges table you may go back to your lessons now or perhaps it would be quicker just to go down to dinner as they are about to end feeling that at last something had gone right today harry got up to leave but the man with the black camera jumped up and cleared his throatphotos dumbledore photos cried bagman excitedly all the judges and champions what do you think ritaer yes lets do those first said rita skeeter whose eyes were upon harry again and then perhaps some individual shotsthe photographs took a long time madame maxime cast everyone else into shadow wherever she stood and the photographer couldnt stand far enough back to get her into the frame eventually she had to sit while everyone else stood around her karkaroff kept twirling his goatee around his finger to give it an extra curl krum whom harry would have thought would have been used to this sort of thing skulked halfhidden at the back of the group the photographer seemed keenest to get fleur at the front but rita skeeter kept hurrying forward and dragging harry into greater prominence then she insisted on separate shots of all the champions at last they were free to goharry went down to dinner hermione wasnt there he supposed she was still in the hospital wing having her teeth fixed he ate alone at the end of the table then returned to gryffindor tower thinking of all the extra work on summoning charms that he had to do up in the dormitory he came across ronyouve had an owl said ron brusquely the moment he walked in he was pointing at harrys pillow the school barn owl was waiting for him thereoh right said harryand weve got to do our detentions tomorrow night snapes dungeon said ronhe then walked straight out of the room not looking at harry for a moment harry considered going after him he wasnt sure whether he wanted to talk to him or hit him both seemed quite appealing but the lure of siriuss answer was too strong harry strode over to the barn owl took the letter off its leg and unrolled itharry i cant say everything i would like to in a letter its too riskyin case the owl is intercepted we need to talk facetoface can you ensure that you are alone by the fire in gryffindor tower at one oclock in the morning on the nd ofnovemberi know better than anyone that you can look after yourself and while youre around dumbledore and moody i dont think anyone will be able to hurt you however someone seems to be having a good try entering you in that tournament would have been very risky especially right under dumbkdores nosebe on the watch harry i still want to hear about anything unusual let me know about the nd ofnovember as quickly as you cansiriuschapter nineteen the hungarian horntailthe prospect of talking facetoface with sirius was all that sustained harry over the next fortnight the only bright spot on a horizon that had never looked darker the shock of finding himself school champion had worn off slightly now and the fear of what was facing him had started to sink in the first task was drawing steadily nearer he felt as though it were crouching ahead of him hike some horrific monster barring his path he had never suffered nerves like these they were way beyond anything he had experienced before a quidditch match not even his last one against slytherin which had decided who would win the quidditch cup harry was finding it hard to think about the future at all he felt as though his whole life had been heading up to and would finish with the first taskadmittedly he didnt see how sirius was going to make him feel any better about having to perform an unknown piece of difficult and dangerous magic in front of hundreds of people but the mere sight of a friendly face would be something at the moment harry wrote back to sirius saying that he would be beside the common room fire at the time sirius had suggested and he and hermione spent a long time going over plans for forcing any stragglers out of the common room on the night in question if the worst came to the worst they were going to drop a bag of dungbombs but they hoped they wouldnt have to resort to that filch would skin them alivein the meantime life became even worse for harry within the confines of the castle for rita skeeter had published her piece about the triwizard tournament and it had turned out to be not so much a report on the tournament as a highly colored life story of harry much of the front page had been given over to a picture of harry the article continuing on pages two six and seven had been all about harry the names of the beauxbatons and durmstrang champions misspelled had been squashed into the last line of the article and cedric hadnt been mentioned at allthe article had appeared ten days ago and harry still got a sick burning feeling of shame in his stomach every time he thought about it rita skeeter had reported him saying an awful lot of things that he couldnt remember ever saying in his life let alone in that broom cupboardi suppose i get my strength from my parents i know theyd be very proud of me if they could see me now yes sometimes at night i still cry about them im not ashamed to admit it i know nothing will hurt me during the tournament because theyre watching over me but rita skeeter had gone even further than transforming his ers into long sickly sentences she had interviewed other people about him tooharry has at last found love at hogwarts his close friend colin creevey says that harry is rarely seen out of the company of one hermione granger a stunningly pretty muggleborn girl who like harry is one of the top students in the schoolfrom the moment the article had appeared harry had had to endure people slytherins mainly quoting it at him as he passed and making sneering commentswant a hanky potter in case you start crying in transfigurationsince when have you been one of the top students in the school potter or is this a school you and longbottom have set up togetherhey harryyeah thats right harry found himself shouting as he wheeled around in the corridor having had just about enough ive just been crying my eyes out over my dead mum and im just off to do a bit more no it was just you dropped your quillit was cho harry felt the color rising in his faceoh right sorry he muttered taking the quill backer good luck on tuesday she said i really hope you do well which left harry feeling extremely stupidhermione had come in for her fair share of unpleasantness too but she hadnt yet started yelling at innocent bystanders in fact harry was full of admiration for the way she was handling the situationstunningly pretty her pansy parkinson had shrieked the first time she had come facetoface with hermione after ritas article had appeared what was she judging against a chipmunkignore it hermione said in a dignified voice holding her head in the air and stalking past the sniggering slytherin girls as though she couldnt hear them just ignore it harrybut harry couldnt ignore it ron hadnt spoken to him at all since he had told him about snapes detentions harry had half hoped they would make things up during the two hours they were forced to pickle rats brains in snapes dungeon but that had been the day ritas article had appeared which seemed to have confirmed rons belief that harry was really enjoying all the attentionhermione was furious with the pair of them she went from one to the other trying to force them to talk to each other but harry was adamant he would talk to ron again only if ron admitted that harry hadnt put his name in the goblet of fire and apologized for calling him a liari didnt start this harry said stubbornly its his problemyou miss him hermione said impatiently and i know he misses you miss him said harry i dont miss him but this was a downright lie harry liked hermione very much but she just wasnt the same as ron there was much hess laughter and a lot more hanging around in the library when hermione was your best friend harry still hadnt mastered summoning charms he seemed to have developed something of a block about them and hermione insisted that learning the theory would help they consequently spent a lot of time poring over books during their lunchtimesviktor krum was in the library an awful lot too and harry wondered what he was up to was he studying or was he looking for things to help him through the first task hermione often complained about krum being there not that he ever bothered them but because groups of giggling girls often turned up to spy on him from behind bookshelves and hermione found the noise distractinghes not even goodlooking she muttered angrily glaring at krums sharp profile they only like him because hes famous they wouldnt look twice at him if he couldnt do that wonkyfaint thing wronski feint said harry through gritted teeth quite apart from liking to get quidditch terms correct it caused him another pang to imagine rons expression if he could have heard hermione talking about wonkyfaintsit is a strange thing but when you are dreading something and would give anything to slow down time it has a disobliging habit of speeding up the days until the first task seemed to slip by as though someone had fixed the clocks to work at double speed harrys feeling of barely controlled panic was with him wherever he went as everpresent as the snide comments about the daily prophet articleon the saturday before the first task all students in the third year and above were permitted to visit the village of hogsmeade hermione told harry that it would do him good to get away from the castle for a bit and harry didnt need much persuasionwhat about ron though he said dont you want to go with himoh well hermione went slightly pink i thought we might meet up with him in the three broomsticks no said harry flatlyoh harry this is so stupid ill come but im not meeting ron and im wearing my invisibility cloakoh all right then hermione snapped but i hate talking to you in that cloak i never know if im looking at you or notso harry put on his invisibility cloak in the dormitory went back downstairs and together he and hermione set off for hogsmeadeharry felt wonderfully free under the cloak he watched other students walking past them as they entered the village most of them sporting support cedric diggory badges but no horrible remarks came his way for a change and nobody was quoting that stupid articlepeople keep looking at me now said hermione grumpily as they came out of honeydukes sweetshop later eating large creamfilled chocolates they think im talking to myselfdont move your lips so much thencome on please just take off your cloak for a bit no ones going to bother you hereoh yeah said harry look behind yourita skeeter and her photographer friend had just emerged from the three broomsticks pub talking in low voices they passed right by hermione without hooking at her harry backed into the wall of honeydukes to stop rita skeeter from hitting him with her crocodileskin handbag when they were gone harry said shes staying in the village i bet shes coming to watch the first taskas he said it his stomach flooded with a wave of molten panic he didnt mention this he and hermione hadnt discussed what was coming in the first task much he had the feeling she didnt want to think about itshes gone said hermione looking right through harry toward the end of the street why dont we go and have a butterbeer in the three broomsticks its a bit cold isnt it you dont have to talk to ron she added irritably correctly interpreting his silencethe three broomsticks was packed mainly with hogwarts students enjoying their free afternoon but also with a variety of magical people harry rarely saw anywhere else harry supposed that as hogsmeade was the only allwizard village in britain it was a bit of a haven for creatures like hags who were not as adept as wizards at disguising themselvesit was very hard to move through crowds in the invisibility cloak in case you accidentally trod on someone which tended to lead to awkward questions harry edged slowly toward a spare table in the corner while hermione went to buy drinks on his way through the pub harry spotted ron who was sitting with fred george and lee jordan resisting the urge to give ron a good hard poke in the back of the head he finally reached the table and sat down at ithermione joined him a moment later and slipped him a butterbeer under his cloaki look like such an idiot sitting here on my own she muttered lucky i brought something to doand she pulled out a notebook in which she had been keeping a record of spew members harry saw his and rons names at the top of the very short list it seemed a long time ago that they had sat making up those predictions together and hermione had turned up and appointed them secretary and treasureryou know maybe i should try and get some of the villagers involved in spew hermione said thoughtfully looking around the pubyeah right said harry he took a swig of butterbeer under his cloak hermione when are you going to give up on this spew stuffwhen houseelves have decent wages and working conditions she hissed back you know im starting to think its time for more direct action i wonder how you get into the school kitchensno idea ask fred and george said harryhermione lapsed into thoughtful silence while harry drank his butterbeer watching the people in the pub all of them looked cheerful and relaxed ernie macmillan and hannah abbot were swapping chocolate frog cards at a nearby table both of them sporting support cedric diggory badges on their cloaks right over by the door he saw cho and a large group of her ravenclaw friends she wasnt wearing a cedric badge though this cheered up harry very slightlywhat wouldnt he have given to be one of these peophe sitting around laughing and talking with nothing to worry about but homework he imagined how it would have felt to be here if his name hadnt come out of the goblet of fire he wouldnt be wearing the invisibility cloak for one thing ron would be sitting with him the three of them would probably be happily imagining what deadly dangerous task the school champions would be facing on tuesday hed have been really hooking forward to it watching them do whatever it wascheering on cedric with everyone else safe in a seat at the back of the standshe wondered how the other champions were feeling every time he had seen cedric lately he had been surrounded by admirers and looking nervous but excited harry glimpsed fleur delacour from time to time in the corridors she looked exactly as she always did haughty and unruffled and krum just sat in the library poring over booksharry thought of sirius and the tight tense knot in his chest seemed to ease slightly he would be speaking to him in just over twelve hours for tonight was the night they were meeting at the common room fire assuming nothing went wrong as everything else had done latelylook its hagrid said hermionethe back of hagrids enormous shaggy head he had mercifully abandoned his bunches emerged over the crowd harry wondered why he hadnt spotted him at once as hagrid was so large but standing up carefully he saw that hagrid had been leaning low talking to professor moody hagrid had his usual enormous tankard in front of him but moody was drinking from his hip flask madam rosmerta the pretty landlady didnt seem to think much of this she was looking askance at moody as she collected glasses from tables around them perhaps she thought it was an insult to her mulled mead but harry knew better moody had told them all during their last defense against the dark arts lesson that he preferred to prepare his own food and drink at all times as it was so easy for dark wizards to poison an unattended cupas harry watched he saw hagrid and moody get up to leave he waved then remembered that hagrid couldnt see him moody however paused his magical eye on the corner where harry was standing he tapped hagrid in the small of the back being unable to reach his shoulder muttered something to him and then the pair of them made their way back across the pub toward harry and hermiones tableall right hermione said hagrid loudlyhello said hermione smiling backmoody limped around the table and bent down harry thought he was reading the spew notebook until he muttered nice cloak potterharry stared at him in amazement the large chunk missing from moodys nose was particularly obvious at a few inches distance moody grinnedcan your eye i mean can you yeah it can see through invisibility cloaks moody said quietly and its come in useful at times i can tell youhagrid was beaming down at harry too harry knew hagrid couldnt see him but moody had obviously told hagrid he was there hagrid now bent down on the pretext of reading the spew notebook as well and said in a whisper so low that only harry could hear it harry meet me tonight at midnight at me cabin wear that cloakstraightening up hagrid said loudly nice ter see yeh hermione winked and departed moody followed himwhy does hagrid want me to meet him at midnight harry said very surpriseddoes he said hermione looking startled i wonder what hes up to i dont know whether you should go harry she looked nervously around and hissed it might make you late for siriusit was true that going down to hagrids at midnight would mean cutting his meeting with sirius very fine indeed hermione suggested sending hedwig down to hagrids to tell him he couldnt go always assuming she would consent to take the note of course harry however thought it better just to be quick at whatever hagrid wanted him for he was very curious to know what this might be hagrid had never asked harry to visit him so late at nightat half past eleven that evening harry who had pretended to go up to bed early pulled the invisibility cloak back over himself and crept back downstairs through the common room quite a few people were still in there the creevey brothers had managed to get hold of a stack of support cedric diggory badges and were trying to bewitch them to make them say support harry potter instead so far however all they had managed to do was get the badges stuck on potter stinks harry crept past them to the portrait hole and waited for a minute or so keeping an eye on his watch then hermione opened the fat lady for him from outside as they had planned he slipped past her with a whispered thanks and set off through the castlethe grounds were very dark harry walked down the lawn toward the lights shining in hagrids cabin the inside of the enormous beauxbatons carriage was also lit up harry could hear madame maxime talking inside it as he knocked on hagrids front dooryou there harry hagrid whispered opening the door and looking aroundyeah said harry slipping inside the cabin and pulling the cloak down off his head whats upgot summat ter show yeh said hagridthere was an air of enormous excitement about hagrid he was wearing a flower that resembled an oversized artichoke in his buttonhole it looked as though he had abandoned the use of axle grease but he had certainly attempted to comb his hair harry could see the combs broken teeth tangled in itwhatre you showing me harry said warily wondering if the skrewts had laid eggs or hagrid had managed to buy another giant threeheaded dog off a stranger in a pubcome with me keep quiet an keep yerself covered with that cloak said hagrid we won take fang he won like it listen hagrid i cant stay long ive got to be back up at the castle by one oclock but hagrid wasnt listening he was opening the cabin door and striding off into the night harry hurried to follow and found to his great surprise that hagrid was leading him to the beauxbatons carriagehagrid what shhh said hagrid and he knocked three times on the door bearing the crossed golden wandsmadame maxime opened it she was wearing a silk shawl wrapped around her massive shoulders she smiled when she saw hagridah agrid it is timebongsewer said hagrid beaming at her and holding out a hand to help her down the golden stepsmadame maxime closed the door behind her hagrid offered her his arm and they set off around the edge of the paddock containing madame maximes giant winged horses with harry totally bewildered running to keep up with them had hagrid wanted to show him madame maxime he could see her any old time he wanted she wasnt exactly hard to missbut it seemed that madame maxime was in for the same treat as harry because after a while she said playfully wair is it you are taking me agridyehll enjoy this said hagrid gruffly worth seein trust me ony don go tellin anyone i showed yeh right yehre not sposed ter knowof course not said madame maxime fluttering her long black eyelashesand still they walked harry getting more and more irritated as he jogged along in their wake checking his watch every now and then hagrid had some harebrained scheme in hand which might make him miss sirius if they didnt get there soon he was going to turn around go straight back to the castle and leave hagrid to enjoy his moonlit stroll with madame maximebut then when they had walked so far around the perimeter of the forest that the castle and the lake were out of sight harry heard something men were shouting up ahead then came a deafening earsplitting roar hagrid led madame maxime around a clump of trees and came to a halt harry hurried up alongside them for a split second he thought he was seeing bonfires and men darting around them and then his mouth fell opendragonsfour fully grown enormous viciouslooking dragons were rearing onto their hind legs inside an enclosure fenced with thick planks of wood roaring and snorting torrents of fire were shooting into the dark sky from their open fanged mouths fifty feet above the ground on their outstretched necks there was a silveryblue one with long pointed horns snapping and snarling at the wizards on the ground a smoothscaled green one which was writhing and stamping with all its might a red one with an odd fringe of fine gold spikes around its face which was shooting mushroomshaped fire clouds into the air and a gigantic black one more lizardhike than the others which was nearest to themat least thirty wizards seven or eight to each dragon were attempting to control them pulling on the chains connected to heavy leather straps around their necks and legs mesmerized harry looked up high above him and saw the eyes of the black dragon with vertical pupils like a cats bulging with either fear or rage he couldnt tell which it was making a horrible noise a yowling screeching screamkeep back there hagrid yelled a wizard near the fence straining on the chain he was holding they can shoot fire at a range of twenty feet you know ive seen this horntail do fortyisn it beautiful said hagrid softlyits no good yelled another wizard stunning spells on the count of threeharry saw each of the dragon keepers pull out his wandstupefy they shouted in unison and the stunning spells shot into the darkness like fiery rockets bursting in showers of stars on the dragons scaly hides harry watched the dragon nearest to them teeter dangerously on its back legs its jaws stretched wide in a silent howl its nostrils were suddenly devoid of flame though still smoking then very slowly it fell several tons of sinewy scalyblack dragon hit the ground with a thud that harry could have sworn made the trees behind him quakethe dragon keepers lowered their wands and walked forward to their fallen charges each of which was the size of a small hill they hurried to tighten the chains and fasten them securely to iron pegs which they forced deep into the ground with their wandswan a closer look hagrid asked madame maxime excitedly the pair of them moved right up to the fence and harry followed the wizard who had warned hagrid not to come any closer turned and harry realized who it was charlie weasleyall right hagrid he panted coming over to talk they should be okay now we put them out with a sleeping draft on the way here thought it might be better for them to wake up in the dark and the quiet but like you saw they werent happy not happy at all what breeds you got here charlie said hagrid gazing at the closest dragon the black one with something chose to reverence its eyes were still just open harry could see a strip of gleaming yellow beneath its wrinkled black eyelidthis is a hungarian horntail said charlie theres a common welsh green over there the smaller one a swedish shortsnout that bluegray and a chinese fireball thats the redcharlie looked around madame maxime was strolling away around the edge of the enclosure gazing at the stunned dragonsi didnt know you were bringing her hagrid charlie said frowning the champions arent supposed to know whats coming shes bound to tell her student isnt shejus thought shed like ter see em shrugged hagrid still gazing enraptured at the dragonsreally romantic date hagrid said charlie shaking his headfour said hagrid so its one fer each o the champions is it whatve they gotta do fight emjust get past them i think said charlie well be on hand if it gets nasty extinguishing spells at the ready they wanted nesting mothers i dont know why but i tell you this i dont envy the one who gets the horntail vicious thing its back ends as dangerous as its front lookcharlie pointed toward the horntails tail and harry saw long bronzecolored spikes protruding along it every few inchesfive of charlies fellow keepers staggered up to the horntail at that moment carrying a clutch of huge granitegray eggs between them in a blanket they placed them carefully at the horntails side hagrid let out a moan of longingive got them counted hagrid said charlie sternly then he said hows harryfine said hagrid he was still gazing at the eggsjust hope hes still fine after hes faced this lot said charlie grimly looking out over the dragons enclosure i didnt dare tell mum what hes got to do for the first task shes already having kittens about him charlie imitated his mothers anxious voice how could they let him enter that tournament hes much too young i thought they were all safe i thought there was going to be an age limit she was in floods after that daily prophet article about him he still cries about his parents oh bless him i never knewharry had had enough trusting to the fact that hagrid wouldnt miss him with the attractions of four dragons and madame maxime to occupy him he turned silently and began to walk away back to the castlehe didnt know whether he was glad hed seen what was coming or not perhaps this way was better the first shock was over now maybe if hed seen the dragons for the first time on tuesday he would have passed out cold in front of the whole school but maybe he would anyway he was going to be armed with his wand which just now felt like nothing more than a narrow strip of wood against a fiftyfoothigh scaly spikeridden firebreathing dragon and he had to get past it with everyone watching howharry sped up skirting the edge of the forest he had just under fifteen minutes to get back to the fireside and talk to sirius and he couldnt remember ever wanting to talk to someone more than he did right now when without warning he ran into something very solidharry fell backward his glasses askew clutching the cloak around him a voice nearby said ouch whos thereharry hastily checked that the cloak was covering him and hay very still staring up at the dark outline of the wizard he had hit he recognized the goatee it was karkaroffwhos there said karkaroff again very suspiciously looking around in the darkness harry remained still and silent after a minute or so karkaroff seemed to decide that he had hit some sort of animal he was looking around at waist height as though expecting to see a dog then he crept back under the cover of the trees and started to edge forward toward the place where the dragons werevery slowly and very carefully harry got to his feet and set off again as fast as he could without making too much noise hurrying through the darkness back toward hogwartshe had no doubt whatsoever what karkaroff was up to he had sneaked off his ship to try and find out what the first task was going to be he might even have spotted hagrid and madame maxime heading off around the forest together they were hardly difficult to spot at a distance and now all karkaroff had to do was follow the sound of voices and he like madame maxime would know what was in store for the championsby the looks of it the only champion who would be facing the unknown on tuesday was cedricharry reached the castle slipped in through the front doors and began to climb the marble stairs he was very out of breath but he didnt dare slow down he had less than five minutes to get up to the firebalderdash he gasped at the fat lady who was snoozing in her frame in front of the portrait holeif you say so she muttered sleepily without opening her eyes and the picture swung forward to admit him harry climbed inside the common room was deserted and judging by the fact that it smelled quite normal hermione had not needed to set off any dungbombs to ensure that he and sirius got privacyharry pulled off the invisibility cloak and threw himself into an armchair in front of the fire the room was in semidarkness the flames were the only source of light nearby on a table the support cedric diggory badges the creeveys had been trying to improve were glinting in the firelight they now read potter really stinks harry looked back into the flames and jumped siriuss head was sitting in the fire if harry hadnt seen mr diggory do exactly this back in the weasleys kitchen it would have scared him out of his wits instead his face breaking into the first smile he had worn for days he scrambled out of his chair crouched down by the hearth and said sirius howre you doingsirius looked different from harrys memory of him when they had said goodbye siriuss face had been gaunt and sunken surrounded by a quantity of long black matted hair but the hair was short and clean now siriuss face was fuller and he looked younger much more like the only photograph harry had of him which had been taken at the potters weddingnever mind me how are you said sirius seriouslyim for a second harry tried to say fine but he couldnt do it before he could stop himself he was talking more than hed talked in days about how no one believed he hadnt entered the tournament of his own free will how rita skeeter had lied about him in the daily prophet how he couldnt walk down a corridor without being sneered at and about ron ron not believing him rons jealousyand now hagrids just shown me whats coming in the first task and its dragons sirius and im a goner he finished desperatelysirius looked at him eyes full of concern eyes that had not yet lost the look that azkaban had given them that deadened haunted look he had let harry talk himself into silence without interruption but now he said dragons we can deal with harry but well get to that in a minute i havent got long here ive broken into a wizarding house to use the fire but they could be back at any time there are things i need to warn you aboutwhat said harry feeling his spirits slip a further few notches surely there could be nothing worse than dragons comingkarkaroff said sirius harry he was a death eater you know what death eaters are dont youyes he whathe was caught he was in azkaban with me but he got released id bet everything thats why dumbledore wanted an auror at hogwarts this year to keep an eye on him moody caught karkaroff put him into azkaban in the first placekarkaroff got released harry said slowly his brain seemed to be struggling to absorb yet another piece of shocking information why did they release himhe did a deal with the ministry of magic said sirius bitterly he said hed seen the error of his ways and then he named names he put a load of other people into azkaban in his place hes not very popular in there i can tell you and since he got out from what i can tell hes been teaching the dark arts to every student who passes through that school of his so watch out for the durmstrang champion as wellokay said harry slowly but are you saying karkaroff put my name in the goblet because if he did hes a really good actor he seemed furious about it he wanted to stop me from competingwe know hes a good actor said sirius because he convinced the ministry of magic to set him free didnt he now ive been keeping an eye on the daily prophet harryyou and the rest of the world said harry bitterly and reading between the lines of that skeeter womans article last month moody was attacked the night before he started at hogwarts yes i know she says it was another false alarm sirius said hastily seeing harry about to speak but i dont think so somehow i think someone tried to stop him from getting to hogwarts i think someone knew their job would be a lot more difficult with him around and no ones going to look into it too closely madeyes heard intruders a bit too often but that doesnt mean he cant still spot the real thing moody was the best auror the ministry ever hadso what are you saying said harry slowly karkaroffs trying to kill me but whysirius hesitatedive been nearing some very strange things he said slowly the death eaters seem to be a bit more active than usual lately they showed themselves at the quidditch world cup didnt they someone set off the dark mark and then did you hear about that ministry of magic witch whos gone missingbertha jorkins said harryexactly she disappeared in albania and thats definitely where voldemort was rumored to be last and she would have known the triwizard tournament was coming up wouldnt sheyeah but its not very likely shed have walked straight into voldemort is it said harrylisten i knew bertha jorkins said sirius grimly she was at hogwarts when i was a few years above your dad and me and she was an idiot very nosy but no brains none at all its not a good combination harry id say shed be very easy to lure into a trapso so voldemort could have found out about the tournament said harry is that what you mean you think karkaroff might be here on his ordersi dont know said sirius slowly i just dont knowkarkaroff doesnt strike me as the type whod go back to voldemort unless he knew voldemort was powerful enough to protect him but whoever put your name in that goblet did it for a reason and i cant help thinking the tournament would be a very good way to attack you and make it hook like an accidentlooks hike a really good plan from where im standing said harry grinning bleaky theyll just have to stand back and let the dragons do their stuffright these dragons said sirius speaking very quickly now theres a way harry dont be tempted to try a stunning spell dragons are strong and too powerfully magical to be knocked out by a single stunner you need about half a dozen wizards at a time to overcome a dragon yeah i know i just saw said harrybut you can do it alone said sirius there is away and a simple spells all you need just but harry held up a hand to silence him his heart suddenly pounding as though it would burst he could hear footsteps coming down the spiral staircase behind himgo he hissed at sirius go theres someone comingharry scrambled to his feet hiding the fire if someone saw siriuss face within the walls of hogwarts they would raise an almighty uproar the ministry would get dragged in he harry would be questioned about siriuss whereabouts harry heard a tiny pop in the fire behind him and knew sirius had gone he watched the bottom of the spiral staircase who had decided to go for a stroll at one oclock in the morning and stopped sirius from telling him how to get past a dragonit was ron dressed in his maroon paisley pajamas ron stopped dead facing harry across the room and looked aroundwho were you talking to he saidwhats that got to do with you harry snarled what are you doing down here at this time of nighti just wondered where you ron broke off shrugging nothing im going back to bedjust thought youd come nosing around did you harry shouted he knew that ron had no idea what hed walked in on knew he hadnt done it on purpose but he didnt care at this moment he hated everything about ron right down to the several inches of bare ankle showing beneath his pajama trouserssorry about that said ron his face reddening with anger shouldve realized you didnt want to be disturbed ill let you get on with practicing for your next interview in peaceharry seized one of the potter really stinks badges off the table and chucked it as hard as he could across the room it hit ron on the forehead and bounced offthere you go harry said something for you to wear on tuesday you might even have a scar now if yonre lucky thats what you want isnt ithe strode across the room toward the stairs he half expected ron to stop him he would even have liked ron to throw a punch at him but ron just stood there in his toosmall pajamas and harry having stormed upstairs lay awake in bed fuming for a long time afterward and didnt hear him come up to bedchapter twenty the first taskharry got up on sunday morning and dressed so inattentively that it was a while before he realized he was trying to pull his hat onto his foot instead of his sock when hed finally got all his clothes on the right parts of his body he hurried off to find hermione locating her at the gryffindor table in the great hall where she was eating breakfast with ginny feeling too queasy to eat harry waited until hermione had swallowed her last spoonful of porridge then dragged her out onto the grounds there he told her all about the dragons and about everything sirius had said while they took another long walk around the lakealarmed as she was by siriuss warnings about karkaroff hermione still thought that the dragons were the more pressing problemlets just try and keep you alive until tuesday evening she said desperately and then we can worry about karkaroffthey walked three times around the lake trying all the way to think of a simple spell that would subdue a dragon nothing whatsoever occurred to them so they retired to the library instead here harry pulled down every book he could find on dragons and both of them set to work searching through the large piletalonclipping by charms treating scalerot this is no good this is for nutters like hagrid who want to keep them healthy dragons are extremely difficult to slay owing to the ancient magic that imbues their thick hides which none but the most powerful spells can penetrate but sirius said a simple one would do it lets try some simple spellbooks then said harry throwing aside men who love dragons too muchhe returned to the table with a pile of spellbooks set them down and began to flick through each in turn hermione whispering nonstop at his elbowwell there are switching spells but whats the point of switching it unless you swapped its fangs for winegums or something that would make it less dangerous the trouble is like that book said not much is going to get through a dragons hide id say transfigure it but something that big you really havent got a hope i doubt even professor mcgonagall unless youre supposed to put the spell on yourself maybe to give yourself extra powers but theyre not simple spells i mean we havent done any of those in class i only know about them because ive been doing owl practice papers hermione harry said through gritted teeth will you shut up for a bit please i m trying to concentratebut all that happened when hermione fell silent was that harrys brain filled with a sort of blank buzzing which didnt seem to allow room for concentration he stared hopelessly down the index of basic hexes for the busy and vexed instant scalping but dragons had no hair pepper breath that would probably increase a dragons firepower horn tongue just what he needed to give it an extra weaponoh no hes back again why cant he read on his stupid ship said hermione irritably as viktor krum slouched in cast a surly look over at the pair of them and settled himself in a distant corner with a pile of books come on harry well go back to the common room his fan clubll be here in a moment twittering away and sure enough as they left the library a gang of girls tiptoed past them one of them wearing a bulgaria scarf tied around her waistharry barely slept that night when he awoke on monday morning he seriously considered for the first time ever just running away from hogwarts but as he looked around the great hall at breakfast time and thought about what leaving the castle would mean he knew he couldnt do it it was the only place he had ever been happy well he supposed he must have been happy with his parents too but he couldnt remember thatsomehow the knowledge that he would rather be here and facing a dragon than back on privet drive with dudley was good to know it made him feel slightly calmer he finished his bacon with difficulty his throat wasnt working too well and as he and hermione got up he saw cedric diggory leaving the hufflepuff tablecedric still didnt know about the dragons the only champion who didnt if harry was right in thinking that maxime and karkaroff would have told fleur and krumhermione ill see you in the greenhouses harry said coming to his decision as he watched cedric leaving the hall go on ill catch you upharry youll be late the bells about to ring ill catch you up okayby the time harry reached the bottom of the marble staircase cedric was at the top he was with a load of sixthyear friends harry didnt want to talk to cedric in front of them they were among those who had been quoting rita skeeters article at him every time he went near them he followed cedric at a distance and saw that he was heading toward the charms corridor this gave harry an idea pausing at a distance from them he pulled out his wand and took careful aimdiffindocedrics bag split parchment quills and books spilled out of it onto the floor several bottles of ink smasheddont bother said cedric in an exasperated voice as his friends bent down to help him tell flitwick im coming go on this was exactly what harry had been hoping for he slipped his wand back into his robes waited until cedrics friends had disappeared into their classroom and hurried up the corridor which was now empty of everyone but himself and cedrichi said cedric picking up a copy of a guide to advanced transfiguration that was now splattered with ink my bag just split brandnew and all cedric said harry the first task is dragonswhat said cedric looking updragons said harry speaking quickly in case professor flitwick came out to see where cedric had got to theyve got four one for each of us and weve got to get past themcedric stared at him harry saw some of the panic hed been feeling since saturday night flickering in cedrics gray eyesare you sure cedric said in a hushed voicedead sure said harry ive seen thembut how did you find out were not supposed to know never mind said harry quickly he knew hagrid would be in trouble if he told the truth but im not the only one who knows fleur and krum will know by now maxime and karkaroff both saw the dragons toocedric straightened up his arms full of inky quills parchment and books his ripped bag dangling off one shoulder he stared at harry and there was a puzzled almost suspicious look in his eyeswhy are you telling me he askedharry looked at him in disbelief he was sure cedric wouldnt have asked that if he had seen the dragons himself harry wouldnt have let his worst enemy face those monsters unprepared well perhaps malfoy or snapeits just fair isnt it he said to cedric we all know now were on an even footing arent wecedric was still hooking at him in a slightly suspicious way when harry heard a familiar clunking noise behind him he turned around and saw madeye moody emerging from a nearby classroomcome with me potter he growled diggory off you goharry stared apprehensively at moody had he overheard themer professor im supposed to be in herbology never mind that potter in my office pleaseharry followed him wondering what was going to happen to him now what if moody wanted to know how hed found out about the dragons would moody go to dumbledore and tell on hagrid or just turn harry into a ferret well it might be easier to get past a dragon if he were a ferret harry thought dully hed be smaller much less easy to see from a height of fifty feethe followed moody into his office moody closed the door behind them and turned to look at harry his magical eye fixed upon him as well as the normal onethat was a very decent thing you just did potter moody said quietlyharry didnt know what to say this wasnt the reaction he had expected at allsit down said moody and harry sat looking aroundhe had visited this office under two of its previous occupants in professor lockharts day the walls had been plastered with beaming winking pictures of professor lockhart himself when lupin had lived here you were more likely to come across a specimen of some fascinating new dark creature he had procured for them to study in class now however the office was full of a number of exceptionally odd objects that harry supposed moody had used in the days when he had been an auroron his desk stood what looked hike a large cracked glass spinning top harry recognized it at once as a sneakoscope because he owned one himself though it was much smaller than moodys in the corner on a small table stood an object that looked something like an extrasquiggly golden television aerial it was humming slightly what appeared to be a mirror hung opposite harry on the wall but it was not reflecting the room shadowy figures were moving around inside it none of them clearly in focuslike my dark detectors do you s aid moody who was watching harry closelywhats that harry asked pointing at the squiggly golden aerialsecrecy sensor vibrates when it detects concealment and lies no use here of course too much interference students in every direction lying about why they havent done their homework been humming ever since i got here i had to disable my sneakoscope because it wouldnt stop whistling its extrasensitive picks up stuff about a mile around of course it could be picking up more than kid stuff he added in a growland whats the mirror foroh thats my foeglass see them out there skulking around im not really in trouble until i see the whites of their eyes thats when i open my trunkhe let out a short harsh laugh and pointed to the large trunk under the window it had seven keyholes in a row harry wondered what was in there until moodys next question brought him sharply back to earthso found out about the dragons have youharry hesitated hed been afraid of this but he hadnt told cedric and he certainly wasnt going to tell moody that hagrid had broken the rulesits all right said moody sitting down and stretching out his wooden leg with a groan cheatings a traditional part of the triwizard tournament and always has beeni didnt cheat said harry sharply it was a sort of accident that i found outmoody grinned i wasnt accusing you laddie ive been telling dumbledore from the start he can be as highminded as he likes but you can bet old karkaroff and maxime wont be theyll have told their champions everything they can they want to win they want to beat dumbledore theyd like to prove hes only humanmoody gave another harsh laugh and his magical eye swiveled around so fast it made harry feel queasy to watch itso got any ideas how youre going to get past your dragon yet said moodyno said harrywell im not going to tell you said moody gruffly i dont show favoritism me im just going to give you some good general advice and the first bit is play to your strengthsi havent got any said harry before he could stop himself excuse me growled moody youve got strengths if i say youve got them think now what are you best atharry tried to concentrate what was he best at well that was easy really quidditch he said dully and a fat lot of help thats right said moody staring at him very hard his magical eye barely moving at all youre a damn good flier from what ive heardyeah but harry stared at him im not allowed a broom ive only got my wandmy second piece of general advice said moody loudly interrupting him is to use a nice simple spell that will enable you to get what you needharry looked at him blankly what did he needcome on boy whispered moody put them together its not that difficultand it clicked he was best at flying he needed to pass the dragon in the air for that he needed his firebolt and for his firebolt he needed hermione harry whispered when he had sped into greenhouse three minutes later uttering a hurried apology to professor sprout as he passed her hermione i need you to help mewhat dyou think ive been trying to do harry she whispered back her eyes round with anxiety over the top of the quivering flutterby bush she was pruninghermione i need to learn how to do a summoning charm properly by tomorrow afternoonand so they practiced they didnt have lunch but headed for a free classroom where harry tried with all his might to make various objects fly across the room toward him he was still having problems the books and quills kept losing heart halfway across the room and dropping hike stones to the floorconcentrate harry concentrate what dyou think im trying to do said harry angrily a great big dragon keeps popping up in my head for some reasonokay try again he wanted to skip divination to keep practicing but hermione refused pointblank to skive off arithmancy and there was no point in staying without her he therefore had to endure over an hour of professor trelawney who spent half the lesson telling everyone that the position of mars with relation to saturn at that moment meant that people born in july were in great danger of sudden violent deathswell thats good said harry loudly his temper getting the better of him just as long as its not drawnout i dont want to sufferron looked for a moment as though he was going to laugh he certainly caught harrys eye for the first time in days but harry was still feeling too resentful toward ron to care he spent the rest of the lesson trying to attract small objects toward him under the table with his wand he managed to make a fly zoom straight into his hand though he wasnt entirely sure that was his prowess at summoning charms perhaps the fly was just stupidhe forced down some dinner after divination then returned to the empty classroom with hermione using the invisibility cloak to avoid the teachers they kept practicing until past midnight they would have stayed longer but peeves turned up and pretending to think that harry wanted things thrown at him started chucking chairs across the room harry and hermione left in a hurry before the noise attracted filch and went back to the gryffindor common room which was now mercifully emptyat two oclock in the morning harry stood near the fireplace surrounded by heaps of objects books quills several upturned chairs an old set of gobstones and nevilles toad trevor only in the last hour had harry really got the hang of the summoning charmthats better harry thats loads better hermione said looking exhausted but very pleasedwell now we know what to do next time i cant manage a spell harry said throwing a rune dictionary back to hermione so he could try again threaten me with a dragon right he raised his wand once more accio dictionarythe heavy book soared out of hermiones hand flew across the room and harry caught itharry i really think youve got it said hermione delightedlyjust as long as it works tomorrow harry said the firebolts going to be much farther away than the stuff in here its going to be in the castle and im going to be out there on the grounds that doesnt matter said hermione firmly just as long as youre concentrating really really hard on it itll come harry wed better get some sleep youre going to need itharry had been focusing so hard on learning the summoning charm that evening that some of his blind panic had heft him it returned in full measure however on the following morning the atmosphere in the school was one of great tension and excitement lessons were to stop at midday giving all the students time to get down to the dragons enclosure though of course they didnt yet know what they would find thereharry felt oddly separate from everyone around him whether they were wishing him good luck or hissing well have a box of tissues ready potter as he passed it was a state of nervousness so advanced that he wondered whether he mightnt just lose his head when they tried to lead him out to his dragon and start trying to curse everyone in sight time was behaving in a more peculiar fashion than ever rushing past in great dollops so that one moment he seemed to be sitting down in his first lesson history of magic and the next walking into lunch and then where had the morning gone the last of the dragonfree hours professor mcgonagall was hurrying over to him in the great hall lots of people were watchingpotter the champions have to come down onto the grounds now you have to get ready for your first taskokay said harry standing up his fork falling onto his plate with a clattergood luck harry hermione whispered youll be fineyeah said harry in a voice that was most unlike his ownhe heft the great hall with professor mcgonagall she didnt seem herself either in fact she looked nearly as anxious as hermione as she walked him down the stone steps and out into the cold november afternoon she put her hand on his shouldernow dont panic she said just keep a cool head weve got wizards standing by to control the situation if it gets out of hand the main thing is just to do your best and nobody will think any the worse of you are you all rightyes harry heard himself say yes im fineshe was leading him toward the place where the dragons were around the edge of the forest but when they approached the clump of trees behind which the enclosure would be clearly visible harry saw that a tent had been erected its entrance facing them screening the dragons from viewyoure to go in here with the other champions said professor mcgonagall in a rather shaky sort of voice and wait for your turn potter mr bagman is in there hell be telling you the the procedure good luckthanks said harry in a flat distant voice she left him at the entrance of the tent harry went insidefleur delacour was sitting in a corner on a how wooden stool she didnt look nearly as composed as usual but rather pale and clammy viktor krum looked even surlier than usual which harry supposed was his way of showing nerves cedric was pacing up and down when harry entered cedric gave him a small smile which harry returned feeling the muscles in his face working rather hard as though they had forgotten how to do itharry goodo said bagman happily looking around at him come in come in make yourself at homebagman looked somehow like a slightly overblown cartoon figure standing amid all the palefaced champions he was wearing his old wasp robes againwell now were all here time to fill you in said bagman brightly when the audience has assembled im going to be offering each of you this bag he held up a small sack of purple silk and shook it at them from which you will each select a small model of the thing you are about to face there are different er varieties you see and i have to tell you something else too ah yes your task is to collect the golden eggharry glanced around cedric had nodded once to show that he understood bagmans words and then started pacing around the tent again he looked slightly green fleur delacour and krum hadnt reacted at all perhaps they thought they might be sick if they opened their mouths that was certainly how harry felt but they at least had volunteered for this and in no time at all hundreds upon hundreds of pairs of feet could be heard passing the tent their owners talking excitedly laughing joking harry felt as separate from the crowd as though they were a different species and then it seemed like about a second later to harry bagman was opening the neck of the purple silk sackladies first he said offering it to fleur delacourshe put a shaking hand inside the bag and drew out a tiny perfect model of a dragon a welsh green it had the number two around its neck and harry knew by the fact that fleur showed no sign of surprise but rather a determined resignation that he had been right madame maxime had told her what was comingthe same held true for krum he pulled out the scarlet chinese fireball it had a number three around its neck he didnt even blink just sat back down and stared at the groundcedric put his hand into the bag and out came the blueishgray swedish shortsnout the number one tied around its neck knowing what was left harry put his hand into the silk bag and pulled out the hungarian horntail and the number four it stretched its wings as he looked down at it and bared its minuscule fangswell there you are said bagman you have each pulled out the dragon you will face and the numbers refer to the order in which you are to take on the dragons do you see now im going to have to leave you in a moment because im commentating mr diggory youre first just go out into the enclosure when you hear a whistle all right now harry could i have a quick word outsideer yes said harry blankly and he got up and went out of the tent with bagman who walked him a short distance away into the trees and then turned to him with a fatherly expression on his facefeeling all right harry anything i can get youwhat said harry i no nothinggot a plan said bagman lowering his voice conspiratorially because i dont mind sharing a few pointers if youd like them you know i mean bagman continued lowering his voice still further youre the underdog here harry anything i can do to help no said harry so quickly he knew he had sounded rude no i i know what im going to do thanksnobody would know harry said bagman winking at himno im fine said harry wondering why he kept telling people this and wondering whether he had ever been less fine ive got a plan worked out i a whistle had blown somewheregood lord ive got to run said bagman in alarm and he hurried offharry walked back to the tent and saw cedric emerging from it greener than ever harry tried to wish him luck as he walked past but all that came out of his mouth was a sort of hoarse gruntharry went back inside to fleur and krum seconds hater they heard the roar of the crowd which meant cedric had entered the enclosure and was now facetoface with the living counterpart of his modelit was worse than harry could ever have imagined sitting there and listening the crowd screamed yelled gasped like a single manyheaded entity as cedric did whatever he was doing to get past the swedish shortsnout krum was still staring at the ground fleur had now taken to retracing cedrics steps around and around the tent and bagmans commentary made everything much much worse horrible pictures formed in harrys mind as he heard oooh narrow miss there very narrow hes taking risks this one clever move pity it didnt workand then after about fifteen minutes harry heard the deafening roar that could mean only one thing cedric had gotten past his dragon and captured the golden eggvery good indeed bagman was shouting and now the marks from the judgesbut he didnt shout out the marks harry supposed the judges were holding them up and showing them to the crowdone down three to go bagman yelled as the whistle blew again miss delacour if you pleasefleur was trembling from head to foot harry felt more warmly toward her than he had done so far as she heft the tent with her head held high and her hand clutching her wand he and krum were left alone at opposite sides of the tent avoiding each others gazethe same process started again oh im not sure that was wise they could hear bagman shouting gleefully oh nearly careful now good lord i thought shed had it thenten minutes later harry heard the crowd erupt into applause once more fleur must have been successful too a pause while fleurs marks were being shown more clapping then for the third time the whistleand here comes mr krum cried bagman and krum slouched out leaving harry quite alonehe felt much more aware of his body than usual very aware of the way his heart was pumping fast and his fingers tingling with fear yet at the same time he seemed to be outside himself seeing the walls of the tent and hearing the crowd as though from far awayvery daring bagman was yelling and harry heard the chinese fireball emit a horrible roaring shriek while the crowd drew its collective breath thats some nerve hes showing and yes hes got the eggapplause shattered the wintery air like breaking glass krum had finished it would be harrys turn any momenthe stood up noticing dimly that his legs seemed to be made of marshmallow he waited and then he heard the whistle blow he walked out through the entrance of the tent the panic rising into a crescendo inside him and now he was walking past the trees through a gap in the enclosure fencehe saw everything in front of him as though it was a very highly colored dream there were hundreds and hundreds of faces staring down at him from stands that had been magicked there since hed last stood on this spot and there was the horntail at the other end of the enclosure crouched low over her clutch of eggs her wings halffurled her evil yellow eyes upon him a monstrous scaly black lizard thrashing her spiked tail heaving yardlong gouge marks in the hard ground the crowd was making a great deal of noise but whether friendly or not harry didnt know or care it was time to do what he had to do to focus his mind entirely and absolutely upon the thing that was his only chancehe raised his wandaccio firebolt he shoutedharry waited every fiber of him hoping praying if it hadnt worked if it wasnt coming he seemed to be looking at everything around him through some sort of shimmering transparent barrier like a heat haze which made the enclosure and the hundreds of faces around him swim strangelyand then he heard it speeding through the air behind him he turned and saw his firebolt hurtling toward him around the edge of the woods soaring into the enclosure and stopping dead in midair beside him waiting for him to mount the crowd was making even more noise bagman was shouting something but harrys ears were not working properly anymore listening wasnt importanthe swung his leg over the broom and kicked off from the ground and a second later something miraculous happenedas he soared upward as the wind rushed through his hair as the crowds faces became mere fleshcolored pinpnicks below and the horntail shrank to the size of a dog he realized that he had heft not only the ground behind but also his fear he was back where he belongedthis was just another quidditch match that was all just another quidditch match and that horntail was just another ugly opposing teamhe looked down at the clutch of eggs and spotted the gold one gleaming against its cementcolored fellows residing safely between the dragons front legs okay harry told himself diversionary tactics lets go he dived the horntails head followed him he knew what it was going to do and pulled out of the dive just in time a jet of fire had been released exactly where he would have been had he not swerved away but harry didnt care that was no more than dodging a bludgergreat scott he can fly yelled bagman as the crowd shrieked and gasped are you watching this mr krumharry soared higher in a circle the horntail was still following his progress its head revolving on its long neck if he kept this up it would be nicely dizzy but better not push it too long or it would be breathing fire again harry plummeted just as the horntail opened its mouth but this time he was less lucky he missed the flames but the tail came whipping up to meet him instead and as he swerved to the left one of the long spikes grazed his shoulder ripping his robes he could feel it stinging he could hear screaming and groans from the crowd but the cut didnt seem to be deep now he zoomed around the back of the horntail and a possibility occurred to himthe horntail didnt seem to want to take off she was too protective of her eggs though she writhed and twisted furling and unfurling her wings and keeping those fearsome yellow eyes on harry she was afraid to move too far from them but he had to persuade her to do it or hed never get near them the trick was to do it carefully graduallyhe began to fly first this way then the other not near enough to make her breathe fire to stave him off but still posing a sufficient threat to ensure she kept her eyes on him her head swayed this way and that watching him out of those vertical pupils her fangs baredhe flew higher the horntails head rose with him her neck now stretched to its fullest extent still swaying hike a snake before its charmer harry rose a few more feet and she let out a roar of exasperation he was like a fly to her a fly she was longing to swat her tail thrashed again but he was too high to reach now she shot fire into the air which he dodged her jaws opened widecome on harry hissed swerving tantalizingly above her come on come and get me up you get now and then she reared spreading her great black leathery wings at last as wide as those of a small airplane and harry dived before the dragon knew what he had done or where he had disappeared to he was speeding toward the ground as fast as he could go toward the eggs now unprotected by her clawed front legs he had taken his hands off his firebolt he had seized the golden egg and with a huge spurt of speed he was off he was soaring out over the stands the heavy egg safely under his uninjured arm and it was as though somebody had just turned the volume back up for the first time he became properly aware of the noise of the crowd which was screaming and applauding as loudly as the irish supporters at the world cup look at that bagman was yelling will you look at that our youngest champion is quickest to get his egg well this is going to shorten the odds on mr potterharry saw the dragon keepers rushing forward to subdue the horntail and over at the entrance to the enclosure professor mcgonagalh professor moody and hagrid hurrying to meet him all of them waving him toward them their smiles evident even from this distance he flew back over the stands the noise of the crowd pounding his eardrums and came in smoothly to land his heart lighter than it had been in weeks he had got through the first task he had survivedthat was excellent potter cried professor mcgonagall as he got off the firebolt which from her was extravagant praise he noticed that her hand shook as she pointed at his shoulder youll need to see madam pomfrey before the judges give out your score over there shes had to mop up diggory already yeh did it harry said hagrid hoarsely yeh did it an agains the horntail an all an yeh know charlie said that was the wors thanks hagrid said harry loudly so that hagrid wouldnt blunder on and reveal that he had shown harry the dragons beforehandprofessor moody looked very pleased too his magical eye was dancing in its socketnice and easy does the trick potter he growledright then potter the first aid tent please said professor mcgonagallharry walked out of the enclosure still panting and saw madam pomfrey standing at the mouth of a second tent looking worrieddragons she said in a disgusted tone pulling harry inside the tent was divided into cubicles he could make out cedrics shadow through the canvas but cedric didnt seem to be badly injured he was sitting up at least madam pomfrey examined harrys shoulder talking furiously all the while last year dementors this year dragons what are they going to bring into this school next youre very lucky this is quite shallow itll need cleaning before i heal it up though she cleaned the cut with a dab of some purple liquid that smoked and stung but then poked his shoulder with her wand and he felt it heal instantlynow just sit quietly for a minute sit and then you can go and get your scoreshe bustled out of the tent and he heard her go next door and say how does it feel now diggoryharry didnt want to sit still he was too full of adrenaline he got to his feet wanting to see what was going on outside but before hed reached the mouth of the tent two people had come darting inside hermione followed closely by ronharry you were brilliant hermione said squeakily there were fingernail marks on her face where she had been clutching it in fear you were amazing you really werebut harry was looking at ron who was very white and staring at harry as though he were a ghostharry he said very seriously whoever put your name in that goblet i i reckon theyre trying to do you init was as though the last few weeks had never happened as though harry were meeting ron for the first time right after hed been made championcaught on have you said harry coldly took you long enoughhermione stood nervously between them looking from one to the other ron opened his mouth uncertainly harry knew ron was about to apologize and suddenly he found he didnt need to hear itits okay he said before ron could get the words out forget it no said ron i shouldntve forget it harry saidron grinned nervously at him and harry grinned back hermione burst into tearstheres nothing to cry about harry told her bewildered you two are so stupid she shouted stamping her foot on the ground tears splashing down her front then before either of them could stop her she had given both of them a hug and dashed away now positively howlingbarking mad said ron shaking his head harry cmon theyll be putting up your scores picking up the golden egg and his firebolt feeling more elated than he would have believed possible an hour ago harry ducked out of the tent ron by his side talking fastyou were the best you know no competition cedric did this weird thing where he transfigured a rock on the ground turned it into a dog he was trying to make the dragon go for the dog instead of him well it was a pretty cool bit of transfiguration and it sort of worked because he did get the egg but he got burned as well the dragon changed its mind halfway through and decided it would rather have him than the labrador he only just got away and that fleur girl tried this sort of charm i think she was trying to put it into a trance well that kind of worked too it went all sleepy but then it snored and this great jet of flame shot out and her skirt caught fire she put it out with a bit of water out of her wand and krum you wont believe this but he didnt even think of flying he was probably the best after you though hit it with some sort of spell right in the eye only thing is it went trampling around in agony and squashed half the real eggs they took marks off for that he wasnt supposed to do any damage to themron drew breath as he and harry reached the edge of the enclosure now that the horntail had been taken away harry could see where the five judges were sitting right at the other end in raised seats draped in goldits marks out of ten from each one ron said and harry squinting up the field saw the first judge madame maxime raise her wand in the air what hooked like a long silver ribbon shot out of it which twisted itself into a large figure eightnot bad said ron as the crowd applauded i suppose she took marks off for your shoulder mr crouch came next he shot a number nine into the airlooking good ron yelled thumping harry on the backnext dumbledore he too put up a nine the crowd was cheering harder than everludo bagman tenten said harry in disbelief but i got hurt whats he playing atharry dont complain ron yelled excitedlyand now karkaroff raised his wand he paused for a moment and then a number shot out of his wand too fourwhat ron bellowed furiously four you lousy biased scumbag you gave krum tenbut harry didnt care he wouldnt have cared if karkaroff had given him zero rons indignation on his behalf was worth about a hundred points to him he didnt tell ron this of course but his heart felt lighter than air as he turned to leave the enclosure and it wasnt just ron those werent only gryffindors cheering in the crowd when it had come to it when they had seen what he was facing most of the school had been on his side as well as cedrics he didnt care about the slytherins he could stand whatever they threw at him nowyoure tied in first place harry you and krum said charlie weasley hurrying to meet them as they set off back toward the school listen ive got to run ive got to go and send mum an owl i swore id tell her what happened but that was unbelievable oh yeah and they told me to tell you youve got to hang around for a few more minutes bagman wants a word back in the champions tentron said he would wait so harry reentered the tent which somehow looked quite different now friendly and welcoming he thought back to how hed felt while dodging the horntail and compared it to the long wait before hed walked out to face it there was no comparison the wait had been immeasurably worsefleur cedric and krum all came in together one side of cedrics face was covered in a thick orange paste which was presumably mending his burn he grinned at harry when he saw himgood one harryand you said harry grinning backwell done all of you said ludo bagman bouncing into the tent and looking as pleased as though he personally had just got past a dragon now just a quick few words youve got a nice long break before the second task which will take place at half past nine on the morning of february the twentyfourth but were giving you something to think about in the meantime if you look down at those golden eggs youre all holding you will see that they open see the hinges there you need to solve the clue inside the egg because it will tell you what the second task is and enable you to prepare for it all clear sure well off you go thenharry left the tent rejoined ron and they started to walk back around the edge of the forest talking hard harry wanted to hear what the other champions had done in more detail then as they rounded the clump of trees behind which harry had first heard the dragons roar a witch leapt out from behind themit was rita skeeter she was wearing acidgreen robes today the quickquotes quill in her hand blended perfectly against themcongratulations harry she said beaming at him i wonder if you could give me a quick word how you felt facing that dragon how you feel now about the fairness of the scoringyeah you can have a word said harry savagely goodbyeand he set off back to the castle with ronchapter twentyone the houseelf liberation frontharry ron and hermione went up to the owlery that evening to find pigwidgeon so that harry could send sirius a letter telling him that he had managed to get past his dragon unscathed on the way harry filled ron in on everything sirius had told him about karkaroff though shocked at first to hear that karkaroff had been a death eater by the time they entered the owlery ron was saying that they ought to have suspected it all alongfits doesnt it he said remember what malfoy said on the train about his dad being friends with karkaroff now we know where they knew each other they were probably running around in masks together at the world cup ill tell you one thing though harry if it was karkaroff who put your name in the goblet hes going to be feeling really stupid now isnt he didnt work did it you only got a scratch come here ill do it pigwidgeon was so overexcited at the idea of a delivery he was flying around and around harrys head hooting incessantly ron snatched pigwidgeon out of the air and held him still while harry attached the letter to his legtheres no way any of the other tasks are going to be that dangerous how could they be ron went on as he carried pigwidgeon to the window you know what i reckon you could win this tournament harry im seriousharry knew that ron was only saying this to make up for his behavior of the last few weeks but he appreciated it all the same hermione however leaned against the owlery wall folded her arms and frowned at ronharrys got a long way to go before he finishes this tournament she said seriously if that was the first task i hate to think whats coming nextright little ray of sunshine arent you said ron you and professor trelawney should get together sometimehe threw pigwidgeon out of the window pigwidgeon plummeted twelve feet before managing to pull himself back up again the letter attached to his leg was much longer and heavier than usual harry hadnt been able to resist giving sirius a blowbyblow account of exactly how he had swerved circled and dodged the horntail they watched pigwidgeon disappear into the darkness and then ron said well wed better get downstairs for your surprise party harry fred and george should have nicked enough food from the kitchens by nowsure enough when they entered the gryffindor common room it exploded with cheers and yells again there were mountains of cakes and flagons of pumpkin juice and butterbeer on every surface lee jordan had let off some filibusters fireworks so that the air was thick with stars and sparks and dean thomas who was very good at drawing had put up some impressive new banners most of which depicted harry zooming around the horntails head on his firebolt though a couple showed cedric with his head on fireharry helped himself to food he had almost forgotten what it was like to feel properly hungry and sat down with ron and hermione he couldnt believe how happy he felt he had ron back on his side hed gotten through the first task and he wouldnt have to face the second one for three monthsblimey this is heavy said lee jordan picking up the golden egg which harry had left on a table and weighing it in his hands open it harry go on lets just see whats inside ithes supposed to work out the clue on his own hermione said swiftly its in the tournament rules i was supposed to work out how to get past the dragon on my own too harry muttered so only hermione could hear him and she grinned rather guiltilyyeah go on harry open it several people echoedlee passed harry the egg and harry dug his fingernails into the groove that ran all the way around it and prised it openit was hollow and completely empty but the moment harry opened it the most horrible noise a loud and screechy wailing filled the room the nearest thing to it harry had ever heard was the ghost orchestra at nearly headless nicks deathday party who had all been playing the musical sawshut it fred bellowed his hands over his earswhat was that said seamus finnigan staring at the egg as harry slammed it shut again sounded like a banshee maybe youve got to get past one of those next harryit was someone being tortured said neville who had gone very white and spilled sausage rolls all over the floor youre going to have to fight the cruciatus cursedont be a prat neville thats illegal said george they wouldnt use the cruciatus curse on the champions i thought it sounded a bit like percy singing maybe youve got to attack him while hes in the shower harrywant a jam tart hermione said fredhermione looked doubtfully at the plate he was offering her fred grinnedits all right he said i havent done anything to them its the custard creams youve got to watch neville who had just bitten into a custard cream choked and spat it out fred laughedjust my little joke neville hermione took a jam tart then she said did you get all this from the kitchens fredyep said fred grinning at her he put on a highpitched squeak and imitated a houseelf anything we can get you sir anything at all theyre dead helpful get me a roast ox if i said i was peckishhow do you get in there hermione said in an innocently casual sort of voiceeasy said fred concealed door behind a painting of a bowl of fruit just tickle the pear and it giggles and he stopped and looked suspiciously at her whynothing said hermione quicklygoing to try and lead the houseelves out on strike now are you said george going to give up all the leaflet stuff and try and stir them up into rebellionseveral people chortled hermione didnt answerdont you go upsetting them and telling them theyve got to take clothes and salaries said fred warningly youll put them off their cookingjust then neville caused a slight diversion by turning into a large canaryoh sorry neville fred shouted over all the laughter i forgot it was the custardcreams we hexed within a minute however neville had molted and once his feathers had fallen off he reappeared looking entirely normal he even joined in laughingcanary creams fred shouted to the excitable crowd george and i invented them seven sickles each a bargainit was nearly one in the morning when harry finally went up to the dormitory with ron neville seamus and dean before he pulled the curtains of his fourposter shut harry set his tiny model of the hungarian horntail on the table next to his bed where it yawned curled up and closed its eyes really harry thought as he pulled the hangings on his fourposter closed hagrid had a point they were all right really dragons the start of december brought wind and sleet to hogwarts drafty though the castle always was in winter harry was glad of its fires and thick walls every time he passed the durmstrang ship on the lake which was pitching in the high winds its black sails billowingagainst the dark skies he thought the beauxbatons caravan was likely to be pretty chilly too hagrid he noticed was keeping madame maximes horses well provided with their preferred drink of singlemalt whiskey the fumes wafting from the trough in the comer of their paddock was enough to make the entire care of magical creatures class lightheaded this was unhelpful as they were still tending the horrible skrewts and needed their wits about themim not sure whether they hibernate or not hagrid told the shivering class in the windy pumpkin patch next lesson thought wed jus try an see if they fancied a kip well jus settle em down in these boxes there were now only ten skrewts left apparently their desire to kill one another had not been exercised out of them each of them was now approaching six feet in length their thick gray armor their powerful scuttling legs their fireblasting ends their stings and their suckers combined to make the skrewts the most repulsive things harry had ever seen the class looked dispiritedly at the enormous boxes hagrid had brought out all lined with pillows and fluffy blanketswell jus lead em in here hagrid said an put the lids on and well see what happensbut the skrewts it transpired did not hibernate and did not appreciate being forced into pillowlined boxes and nailed in hagrid was soon yelling don panic now don panic while the skrewts rampaged around the pumpkin patch now strewn with the smoldering wreckage of the boxes most of the class malfoy crabbe and goyle in the lead had fled into hagrids cabin through the back door and barricaded themselves in harry ron and hermione however were among those who remained outside trying to help hagrid together they managed to restrain and tie up nine of the skrewts though at the cost of numerous burns and cuts finally only one skrewt was leftdon frighten him now hagrid shouted as ron and harry used their wands to shoot jets of fiery sparks at the skrewt which was advancing menacingly on them its sting arched quivering over its back jus try an slip the rope round his sting so he won hurt any o the othersyeah we wouldnt want that ron shouted angrily as he and harry backed into the wall of hagrids cabin still holding the skrewt off with their sparkswell well well this does look like funrita skeeter was leaning on hagrids garden fence looking in at the mayhem she was wearing a thick magenta cloak with a furry purple collar today and her crocodileskin handbag was over her armhagrid launched himself forward on top of the skrewt that was cornering harry and ron and flattened it a blast of fire shot out of its end withering the pumpkin plants nearbywhore you hagrid asked rita skeeter as he slipped a loop of rope around the skrewts sting and tightened itrita skeeter daily prophet reporter rita replied beaming at him her gold teeth glintedthought dumbledore said you weren allowed inside the school anymore said hagrid frowning slightly as he got off the slightly squashed skrewt and started tugging it over to its fellowsrita acted as though she hadnt heard what hagrid had saidwhat are these fascinating creatures called she asked beaming still more widelyblastended skrewts grunted hagridreally said rita apparently full of lively interest ive never heard of them beforewhere do they come fromharry noticed a dull red flush rising up out of hagrids wild black beard and his heart sank where had hagrid got the skrewts from hermione who seemed to be thinking along these lines said quickly theyre very interesting arent they arent they harrywhat oh yeah ouch interesting said harry as she stepped on his footah youre here harry said rita skeeter as she looked around so you like care of magical creatures do you one of your favorite lessonsyes said harry stoutly hagrid beamed at himlovely said rita really lovely been teaching long she added to hagridharry noticed her eyes travel over dean who had a nasty cut across one cheek lavender whose robes were badly singed seamus who was nursing several burnt fingers and then to the cabin windows where most of the class stood their noses pressed against the glass waiting to see if the coast was clearthis is ony me second year said hagridlovely i dont suppose youd like to give an interview would you share some of your experience of magical creatures the prophet does a zoological column every wednesday as im sure you know we could feature these er bangended scootsblastended skrewts hagrid said eagerly er yeah why notharry had a very bad feeling about this but there was no way of communicating it to hagrid without rita skeeter seeing so he had to stand and watch in silence as hagrid and rita skeeter made arrangements to meet in the three broomsticks for a good long interview later that week then the bell rang up at the castle signaling the end of the lessonwell goodbye harry rita skeeter called merrily to him as he set off with ron and hermione until friday night then hagridshell twist everything he says harry said under his breathjust as long as he didnt import those skrewts illegally or anything said hermione desperately they looked at one another it was exactly the sort of thing hagrid might dohagrids been in loads of trouble before and dumbledores never sacked him said ron consolingly worst that can happen is hagridll have to get rid of the skrewts sorry did i say worst i meant bestharry and hermione laughed and feeling slightly more cheerful went off to lunchharry thoroughly enjoyed double divination that afternoon they were still doing star charts and predictions but now that he and ron were friends once more the whole thing seemed very funny again professor trelawney who had been so pleased with the pair of them when they had been predicting their own horrific deaths quickly became irritated as they sniggered through her explanation of the various ways in which pluto could disrupt everyday lifei would think she said in a mystical whisper that did not conceal her obvious annoyance that some of us she stared very meaningfully at harry might be a little less frivolous had they seen what i have seen during my crystal gazing last night as i sat here absorbed in my needlework the urge to consult the orb overpowered me i arose i settled myself before it and i gazed into its crystalline depths and what do you think i saw gazing back at mean ugly old bat in outsize specs ron muttered under his breathharry fought hard to keep his face straightdeath my dearsparvati and lavender both put their hands over their mouths looking horrifiedyes said professor trelawney nodding impressively it comes ever closer it circles overhead like a vulture ever lower ever lower over the castle she stared pointedly at harry who yawned very widely and obviouslyitd be a bit more impressive if she hadnt done it about eighty times before harry said as they finally regained the fresh air of the staircase beneath professor trelawneys room but if id dropped dead every time shes told me im going to id be a medical miracleyoud be a sort of extraconcentrated ghost said ron chortling as they passed the bloody baron going in the opposite direction his wide eyes staring sinisterly at least we didnt get homework i hope hermione got loads off professor vector i love not working when she is but hermione wasnt at dinner nor was she in the library when they went to look for her afterward the only person in there was viktor krum ron hovered behind the bookshelves for a while watching krum debating in whispers with harry whether he should ask for an autograph but then ron realized that six or seven girls were lurking in the next row of books debating exactly the same thing and he lost his enthusiasm for the ideawonder where shes got to ron said as he and harry went back to gryffindor towerdunno balderdashbut the fat lady had barely begun to swing forward when the sound of racing feet behind them announced hermiones arrivalharry she panted skidding to a halt beside him the fat lady stared down at her eyebrows raised harry youve got to come youve got to come the most amazing things happened please she seized harrys arm and started to try to drag him back along the corridorwhats the matter harry saidill show you when we get there oh come on quick harry looked around at ron he looked back at harry intriguedokay harry said starting off back down the corridor with hermione ron hurrying to keep upoh dont mind me the fat lady called irritably after them dont apologize for bothering me ill just hang here wide open until you get back shall iyeah thanks ron shouted over his shoulderhermione where are we going harry asked after she had ledthem down through six floors and started down the marble staircase into the entrance hallyoull see youll see in a minute said hermione excitedlyshe turned left at the bottom of the staircase and hurried toward the door through which cedric diggory had gone the night after the goblet of fire had regurgitated his and harrys names harry had never been through here before he and ron followed hermione down a flight of stone steps but instead of ending up in a gloomy underground passage like the one that led to snapes dungeon they found themselves in a broad stone corridor brightly lit with torches and decorated with cheerful paintings that were mainly of foodoh hang on said harry slowly halfway down the corridor wait a minute hermione what she turned around to look at him anticipation all over her facei know what this is about said harryhe nudged ron and pointed to the painting just behind hermione it showed a gigantic silver fruit bowlhermione said ron cottoning on youre trying to rope us into that spew stuff againno no im not she said hastily and its not spew ron changed the name have you said ron frowning at her what are we now then the houseelf liberation front im not barging into that kitchen and trying to make them stop work im not doing it im not asking you to hermione said impatiently i came down here just now to talk to them all and i found oh come on harry i want to show youshe seized his arm again pulled him in front of the picture of the giant fruit bowl stretched out her forefinger and tickled the huge green pear it began to squirm chuckling and suddenly turned into a large green door handle hermione seized it pulled the door open and pushed harry hard in the back forcing him insidehe had one brief glimpse of an enormous highceilinged room large as the great hall above it with mounds of glittering brass pots and pans heaped around the stone walls and a great brick fireplace at the other end when something small hurtled toward him from the middle of the room squealing harry potter sir harry potternext second all the wind had been knocked out of him as the squealing elf hit him hard in the midriff hugging him so tightly he thought his ribs would breakddobby harry gaspedit is dobby sir it is squealed the voice from somewhere around his navel dobby has been hoping and hoping to see harry potter sir and harry potter has come to see him sirdobby let go and stepped back a few paces beaming up at harry his enormous green tennisballshaped eyes brimming with tears of happiness he looked almost exactly as harry remembered him the pencilshaped nose the batlike ears the long fingers and feet all except the clothes which were very differentwhen dobby had worked for the malfoys he had always worn the same filthy old pillowcase now however he was wearing the strangest assortment of garments harry had ever seen he had done an even worse job of dressing himself than the wizards at the world cup he was wearing a tea cozy for a hat on which he had pinned a number of bright badges a tie patterned with horseshoes over a bare chest a pair of what looked like childrens soccer shorts and odd socks one of these harry saw was the black one harry had removed from his own foot and tricked mr malfoy into giving dobby thereby setting dobby free the other was covered in pink and orange stripesdobby whatre you doing here harry said in amazement dobby has come to work at hogwarts sir dobby squealed excitedly professor dumbledore gave dobby and winky jobs sirwinky said harry shes here tooyes sir yes said dobby and he seized harrys hand and pulled him off into the kitchen between the four long wooden tables that stood there each of these tables harry noticed as he passed them was positioned exactly beneath the four house tables above in the great hall at the moment they were clear of food dinner having finished but he supposed that an hour ago they had been laden with dishes that were then sent up through the ceiling to their counterparts aboveat least a hundred little elves were standing around the kitchen beaming bowing and curtsying as dobby led harry past them they were all wearing the same uniform a tea towel stamped with the hogwarts crest and tied as winkys had been like a togadobby stopped in front of the brick fireplace and pointedwinky sir he saidwinky was sitting on a stool by the fire unlike dobby she had obviously not foraged for clothes she was wearing a neat little skirt and blouse with a matching blue hat which had holes in it for her large ears however while every one of dobbys strange collection of garments was so clean and well cared for that it looked brandnew winky was plainly not taking care other clothes at all there were soup stains all down her blouse and a burn in her skirthello winky said harrywinkys lip quivered then she burst into tears which spilled out of her great brown eyes and splashed down her front just as they had done at the quidditch world cupoh dear said hermione she and ron had followed harry and dobby to the end of the kitchen winky dont cry please dontbut winky cried harder than ever dobby on the other hand beamed up at harrywould harry potter like a cup of tea he squeaked loudly over winkys sobser yeah okay said harryinstantly about six houseelves came trotting up behind him bearing a large silver tray laden with a teapot cups for harry ron and hermione a milk jug and a large plate of biscuitsgood service ron said in an impressed voice hermione frowned at him but the elves all looked delighted they bowed very low and retreatedhow long have you been here dobby harry asked as dobby handed around the teaonly a week harry potter sir said dobby happily dobby came to see professor dumbledore sir you see sir it is very difficult for a houseelf who has been dismissed to get a new position sir very difficult indeed at this winky howled even harder her squashedtomato of a nose dribbling all down her front though she made no effort to stem the flowdobby has traveled the country for two whole years sir trying to find work dobby squeaked but dobby hasnt found work sir because dobby wants paying nowthe houseelves all around the kitchen who had been listening and watching with interest all looked away at these words as though dobby had said something rude and embarrassing hermione however said good for you dobbythank you miss said dobby grinning toothily at her but most wizards doesnt want a houseelf who wants paying miss thats not the point of a houseelf they says and they slammed the door in dobbys face dobby likes work but he wants to wear clothes and he wants to be paid harry potter dobby likes being freethe hogwarts houseelves had now started edging away from dobby as though he were carrying something contagious winky however remained where she was though there was a definite increase in the volume other cryingand then harry potter dobby goes to visit winky and finds out winky has been freed too sir said dobby delightedlyat this winky flung herself forward off her stool and lay facedown on the flagged stone floor beating her tiny fists upon it and positively screaming with misery hermione hastily dropped down to her knees beside her and tried to comfort her but nothing she said made the slightest difference dobby continued with his story shouting shrilly over winkys screechesand then dobby had the idea harry potter sir why doesnt dobby and winky find work together dobby says where is there enough work for two houseelves says winky and dobby thinks and it comes to him sir hogwarts so dobby and winky came to see professor dumbledore sir and professor dumbledore took us ondobby beamed very brightly and happy tears welled in his eyes againand professor dumbledore says he will pay dobby sir if dobby wants paying and so dobby is a free elf sir and dobby gets a galleon a week and one day off a monththats not very much hermione shouted indignantly from the floor over winkys continued screaming and fistbeatingprofessor dumbledore offered dobby ten galleons a week and weekends off said dobby suddenly giving a little shiver as though the prospect of so much leisure and riches were frightening but dobby beat him down miss dobby likes freedom miss but he isnt wanting too much miss he likes work betterand how much is professor dumbledore paying you winky hermione asked kindlyif she had thought this would cheer up winky she was wildly mistaken winky did stop crying but when she sat up she was glaring at hermione through her massive brown eyes her whole face sopping wet and suddenly furiouswinky is a disgraced elf but winky is not yet getting paid she squeaked winky is not sunk so low as that winky is properly ashamed of being freedashamed said hermione blankly but winky come on its mr crouch who should be ashamed not you you didnt do anything wrong he was really horrible to you but at these words winky clapped her hands over the holes in her hat flattening her ears so that she couldnt hear a word and screeched you is not insulting my master miss you is not insulting mr crouch mr crouch is a good wizard miss mr crouch is right to sack bad winkywinky is having trouble adjusting harry potter squeaked dobby confidentially winky forgets she is not bound to mr crouch anymore she is allowed to speak her mind now but she wont do itcant houseelves speak their minds about their masters then harry askedoh no sir no said dobby looking suddenly serious tis part of the houseelfs enslavement sir we keeps their secrets and our silence sir we upholds the familys honor and we never speaks ill of them though professor dumbledore told dobby he does not insist upon this professor dumbledore said we is free to todobby looked suddenly nervous and beckoned harry closer harry bent forward dobby whispered he said we is free to call him a a barmy old codger if we likes sirdobby gave a frightened sort of gigglebut dobby is not wanting to harry potter he said talking normally again and shaking his head so that his ears flapped dobby likes professor dumbledore very much sir and is proud to keep his secrets and our silence for himbut you can say what you like about the malfoys now harry asked him grinninga slightly fearful look came into dobbys immense eyesdobby dobby could he said doubtfully he squared his small shoulders dobby could tell harry potter that his old masters were were bad dark wizardsdobby stood for a moment quivering all over horrorstruck by his own daring then he rushed over to the nearest table and began banging his head on it very hard squealing bad dobby bad dobbyharry seized dobby by the back of his tie and pulled him away from the tablethank you harry potter thank you said dobby breathlessly rubbing his headyou just need a bit of practice harry saidpractice squealed winky furiously you is ought to be ashamed of yourself dobby talking that way about your mastersthey isnt my masters anymore winky said dobby defiantly dobby doesnt care what they think anymoreoh you is a bad elf dobby moaned winky tears leaking down her face once more my poor mr crouch what is he doing without winky he is needing me he is needing my help i is looking after the crouches all my life and my mother is doing it before me and my grandmother is doing it before her oh what is they saying if they knew winky was freed oh the shame the shame she buried her face in her skirt again and bawledwinky said hermione firmly im quite sure mr crouch is getting along perfectly well without you weve seen him you know you is seeing my master said winky breathlessly raising her tearstained face out of her skirt once more and goggling at hermione you is seeing him here at hogwartsyes said hermione he and mr bagman are judges in the triwizard tournamentmr bagman comes too squeaked winky and to harry s great surprise and rons and hermiones too by the looks on their faces she looked angry again mr bagman is a bad wizard a very bad wizard my master isnt liking him oh no not at allbagman bad said harryoh yes winky said nodding her head furiously my master is telling winky some things but winky is not saying winky winky keeps her masters secrets she dissolved yet again in tears they could hear her sobbing into her skirt poor master poor master no winky to help him no morethey couldnt get another sensible word out of winky they left her to her crying and finished their tea while dobby chatted happily about his life as a free elf and his plans for his wagesdobby is going to buy a sweater next harry potter he said happily pointing at his bare chesttell you what dobby said ron who seemed to have taken a great liking to the elf ill give you the one my mum knits me this christmas i always get one from her you dont mind maroon do youdobby was delightedwe might have to shrink it a bit to fit you ron told him but itll go well with your tea cozyas they prepared to take their leave many of the surrounding elves pressed in upon them offering snacks to take back upstairs hermione refused with a pained look at the way the elves kept bowing and curtsying but harry and ron loaded their pockets with cream cakes and piesthanks a lot harry said to the elves who had all clustered around the door to say good night see you dobbyharry potter can dobby come and see you sometimes sir dobby asked tentativelycourse you can said harry and dobby beamedyou know what said ron once he hermione and harry had left the kitchens behind and were climbing the steps into the entrance hall again all these years ive been really impressed with fred and george nicking food from the kitchens well its not exactly difficult is it they cant wait to give it awayi think this is the best thing that could have happened to those elves you know said hermione leading the way back up the marble staircase dobby coming to work here i mean the other elves will see how happy he is being free and slowly itll dawn on them that they want that toolets hope they dont look too closely at winky said harryoh shell cheer up said hermione though she sounded a bit doubtful once the shocks worn off and shes got used to hogwarts shell see how much better off she is without that crouch manshe seems to love him said ron thickly he had just started on a cream cakedoesnt think much of bagman though does she said harry wonder what crouch says at home about himprobably says hes not a very good head of department said hermione and lets face it hes got a point hasnt heid still rather work for him than old crouch said ron at least bagmans got a sense of humordont let percy hear you saying that hermione said smiling slightlyyeah well percy wouldnt want to work for anyone with a sense of humor would he said ron now starting on a chocolate eclair percy wouldnt recognize a joke if it danced naked in front of him wearing dobbys tea cozychapter twentytwo the unexpected taskpotter weasley will you pay attentionprofessor mcgonagalls irritated voice cracked like a whip through the transfiguration class on thursday and harry and ron both jumped and looked upit was the end of the lesson they had finished their work the guinea fowl they had been changing into guinea pigs had been shut away in a large cage on professor mcgonagalls desk nevilles still had feathers they had copied down their homework from the blackboard describe with examples the ways in which transforming spells must be adapted when performing crossspecies switches the bell was due to ring at any moment and harry and ron who had been having a sword fight with a couple of fred and georges fake wands at the back of the class looked up ron holding a tin parrot and harry a rubber haddocknow that potter and weasley have been kind enough to act their age said professor mcgonagall with an angry look at the pair of them as the head of harrys haddock drooped and fell silently to the floor rons parrots beak had severed it moments before i have something to say to you allthe yule ball is approaching a traditional part of the triwizard tournament and an opportunity for us to socialize with our foreign guests now the ball will be open only to fourth years and above although you may invite a younger student if you wish lavender brown let out a shrill giggle parvati patil nudged her hard in the ribs her face working furiously as she too fought not to giggle they both looked around at harry professor mcgonagall ignored them which harry thought was distinctly unfair as she had just told off him and rondress robes will be worn professor mcgonagall continued and the ball will start at eight oclock on christmas day finishing at midnight in the great hall now then professor mcgonagall stared deliberately around the classthe yule ball is of course a chance for us all to er let our hair down she said in a disapproving voicelavender giggled harder than ever with her hand pressed hard against her mouth to stifle the sound harry could see what was funny this time professor mcgonagall with her hair in a tight bun looked as though she had never let her hair down in any sensebut that does not mean professor mcgonagall went on that we will be relaxing the standards of behavior we expect from hogwarts students i will be most seriously displeased if a gryffindor student embarrasses the school in any waythe bell rang and there was the usual scuffle of activity as everyone packed their bags and swung them onto their shouldersprofessor mcgonagall called above the noise potter a word if you pleaseassuming this had something to do with his headless rubber haddock harry proceeded gloomily to the teachers desk professor mcgonagall waited until the rest of the class had gone and then said potter the champions and their partners what partners said harryprofesor mcgonagall looked suspiciously at him as though she thought he was trying to be funnyyour partners for the yule ball potter she said coldly your dance partnersharrys insides seemed to curl up and shriveldance partners he felt himself going red i dont dance he said quicklyoh yes you do said professor mcgonagall irritably thats what im telling you traditionally the champions and their partners open the ballharry had a sudden mental image of himself in a top hat and tails accompanied by a girl in the sort of frilly dress aunt petunia always wore to uncle vernons work partiesim not dancing he saidit is traditional said professor mcgonagall firmly you are a hogwarts champion and you will do what is expected of you as a representative of the school so make sure you get yourself a partner potterbuti dontyou heard me potter said professor mcgonagall in a very final sort of waya week ago harry would have said finding a partner for a dance would be a cinch compared to taking on a hungarian horntail but now that he had done the latter and was facing the prospect of asking a girl to the ball he thought hed rather have another round with the dragonharry had never known so many people to put their names down to stay at hogwarts for christmas he always did of course because the alternative was usually going back to privet drive but he had always been very much in the minority before now this year however everyone in the fourth year and above seemed to be staying and they all seemed to harry to be obsessed with the coming ball or at least all the girls were and it was amazing how many girls hogwarts suddenly seemed to hold he had never quite noticed that before girls giggling and whispering in the corridors girls shrieking with laughter as boys passed them girls excitedly comparing notes on what they were going to wear on christmas night why do they have to move in packs harry asked ron as a dozen or so girls walked past them sniggering and staring at harry howre you supposed to get one on their own to ask themlasso one ron suggested got any idea who youre going to tryharry didnt answer he knew perfectly well whom hed like to ask but working up the nerve was something else cho was a year older than he was she was very pretty she was a very good quidditch player and she was also very popularron seemed to know what was going on inside harrys headlisten youre not going to have any trouble youre a champion youve just beaten a hungarian horntail i bet theyll be queuing up to go with youin tribute to their recently repaired friendship ron had kept the bitterness in his voice to a bare minimum moreover to harrys amazement he turned out to be quite righta curlyhaired thirdyear hufflepuff girl to whom harry had never spoken in his life asked him to go to the ball with her the very next day harry was so taken aback he said no before hed even stopped to consider the matter the girl walked off looking rather hurt and harry had to endure deans seamuss and rons taunts about her all through history of magic the following day two more girls asked him a second year and to his horror a fifth year who looked as though she might knock him out if he refusedshe was quite goodlooking said ron fairly after hed stopped laughingshe was a foot taller than me said harry still unnerved imagine what id look like trying to dance with herhermiones words about krum kept coming back to him they only like him because hes famous harry doubted very much if any of the girls who had asked to be his partner so far would have wanted to go to the ball with him if he hadnt been a school champion then he wondered if this would bother him if cho asked himon the whole harry had to admit that even with the embarrassing prospect of opening the ball before him life had definitely improved since he had got through the first task he wasnt attracting nearly as much unpleasantness in the corridors anymore which he suspected had a lot to do with cedric he had an idea cedric might have told the hufflepuffs to leave harry alone in gratitude for harrys tipoff about the dragons there seemed to be fewer support cedric diggory badges around too draco malfoy of course was still quoting rita skeeters article to him at every possible opportunity but he was getting fewer and fewer laughs out of it and just to heighten harrys feeling of wellbeing no story about hagrid had appeared in the daily prophetshe didn seem very intrested in magical creatures ter tell yeh the truth hagrid said when harry ron and hermione asked him how his interview with rita skeeter had gone during the last care of magical creatures lesson of the term to their very great relief hagrid had given up on direct contact with the skrewts now and they were merely sheltering behind his cabin today sitting at a trestle table and preparing a fresh selection of food with which to tempt the skrewtsshe jus wanted me ter talk about you harry hagrid continued in a low voice well i told her wed been friends since i went ter fetch yeh from the dursleys never had to tell him off in four years she said never played you up in lessons has he i told her no an she didn seem happy at all yehd think she wanted me to say yeh were horrible harrycourse she did said harry throwing lumps of dragon liver into a large metal bowl and picking up his knife to cut some more she cant keep writing about what a tragic little hero i am itll get boringshe wants a new angle hagrid said ron wisely as he shelled salamander eggs you were supposed to say harrys a mad delinquentbut hes not said hagrid looking genuinely shockedshe shouldve interviewed snape said harry grimly hed give her the goods on me any day potter has been crossing lines ever since he first arrived at this school said that did he said hagrid while ron and hermione laughed well yeh mightve bent a few rules harry bu yehre all righ really aren youcheers hagrid said harry grinningyou coming to this ball thing on christmas day hagrid said ronthough i might look in on it yeah said hagrid gruffly should be a good do i reckon youll be openin the dancin won yeh harry whore you takinno one yet said harry feeling himself going red again hagrid didnt pursue the subjectthe last week of term became increasingly boisterous as it progressed rumors about the yule ball were flying everywhere though harry didnt believe half of them for instance that dumbledore had bought eight hundred barrels of mulled mead from madam rosmerta it seemed to be fact however that he had booked the weird sisters exactly who or what the weird sisters were harry didnt know never having had access to a wizards wireless but he deduced from the wild excitement of those who had grown up listening to the wwn wizarding wireless network that they were a very famous musical groupsome of the teachers like little professor flitwick gave up trying to teach them much when their minds were so clearly elsewhere he allowed them to play games in his lesson on wednesday and spent most of it talking to harry about the perfect summoning charmharry had used during the first task of the triwizard tournament other teachers were not so generous nothing would ever deflect professor binns for example from plowing on through his notes on goblin rebellions as binns hadnt let his own death stand in the way of continuing to teach they supposed a small thing like christmas wasnt going to put him off it was amazing how he could make even bloody and vicious goblin riots sound as boring as percys cauldronbottom report professors mcgonagall and moody kept them working until the very last second of their classes too and snape of course would no sooner let them play games in class than adopt harry staring nastily around at them all he informed them that he would be testing them on poison antidotes during the last lesson of the termevil he is ron said bitterly that night in the gryffindor common room springing a test on us on the last day ruining the last bit of term with a whole load of studyingmmm youre not exactly straining yourself though are you said hermione looking at him over the top of her potions notes ron was busy building a card castle out of his exploding snap pack a much more interesting pastime than with muggle cards because of the chance that the whole thing would blow up at any secondits christmas hermione said harry lazily he was rereading flying with the cannons for the tenth time in an armchair near the firehermione looked severely over at him too id have thought youd be doing something constructive harry even if you dont want to learn your antidoteslike what harry said as he watched joey jenkins of the cannons belt a bludger toward a ballycastle bats chaserthat egg hermione hissedcome on hermione ive got till february the twentyfourth harry saidhe had put the golden egg upstairs in his trunk and hadnt opened it since the celebration party after the first task there were still two and a half months to go until he needed to know what all the screechy wailing meant after allbut it might take weeks to work it out said hermione youre going to look a real idiot if everyone else knows what the next task is and you dontleave him alone hermione hes earned a bit of a break said ron and he placed the last two cards on top of the castle and the whole lot blew up singeing his eyebrowsnice look ron go well with your dress robes that willit was fred and george they sat down at the table with harry ron and hermione as ron felt how much damage had been doneron can we borrow pigwidgeon george askedno hes off delivering a letter said ron whybecause george wants to invite him to the ball said fred sarcasticallybecause we want to send a letter you stupid great prat said georgewho dyou two keep writing to eh said ronnose out ron or ill burn that for you too said fred waving his wand threateningly so you lot got dates for the ball yetnope said ronwell youd better hurry up mate or all the good ones will be gone said fredwhore you going with then said ronangelina said fred promptly without a trace of embarrassmentwhat said ron taken aback youve already asked hergood point said fred he turned his head and called across the common room oi angelinaangelina who had been chatting with alicia spinnet near the fire looked over at himwhat she called backwant to come to the ball with meangelina gave fred an appraising sort of lookall right then she said and she turned back to alicia and carried on chatting with a bit of a grin on her facethere you go said fred to harry and ron piece of cakehe got to his feet yawning and said wed better use a school owl then george come on they left ron stopped feeling his eyebrows and looked across the smoldering wreck of his card castle at harrywe should get a move on you know ask someone hes right we dont want to end up with a pair of trollshermione let out a sputter of indignationa pair of what excuse mewell you know said ron shrugging id rather go alone than with with eloise midgen sayher acnes loads better lately and shes really niceher nose is offcenter said ronoh i see hermione said bristling so basically youre going to take the bestlooking girl wholl have you even if shes completely horribleer yeah that sounds about right said ron im going to bed hermione snapped and she swept off toward the girls staircase without another wordthe hogwarts staff demonstrating a continued desire to impress the visitors from beauxbatons and durmstrang seemed determined to show the castle at its best this christmas when the decorations went up harry noticed that they were the most stunning he had yet seen inside the school everlasting icicles had been attached to the banisters of the marble staircase the usual twelve christmas trees in the great hall were bedecked with everything from luminous holly berries to real hooting golden owls and the suits of armor had all been bewitched to sing carols whenever anyone passed them it was quite something to hear come all ye faithful sung by an empty helmet that only knew half the words several times filch the caretaker had to extract peeves from inside the armor where he had taken to hiding filling in the gaps in the songs with lyrics of his own invention all of which were very rudeand still harry hadnt asked cho to the ball he and ron were getting very nervous now though as harry pointed out ron would look much less stupid than he would without a partnerharry was supposed to be starting the dancing with the other championsi suppose theres always moaning myrtle he said gloomily referring to the ghost who haunted the girls toilets on the second floorharry weve just got to grit our teeth and do it said ron on friday morning in a tone that suggested they were planning the storming of an impregnable fortress when we get back to the common room tonight well both have partners agreeder okay said harrybut every time he glimpsed cho that day during break and then lunchtime and once on the way to history of magic she was surrounded by friends didnt she ever go anywhere alone could he perhaps ambush her as she was going into a bathroom but no she even seemed to go there with an escort of four or five girls yet if he didnt do it soon she was bound to have been asked by somebody elsehe found it hard to concentrate on snapes potions test and consequently forgot to add the key ingredient a bezoar meaning that he received bottom marks he didnt care though he was too busy screwing up his courage for what he was about to do when the bell rang he grabbed his bag and hurried to the dungeon doorill meet you at dinner he said to ron and hermione and he dashed off upstairshed just have to ask cho for a private word that was all he hurried off through the packed corridors looking for her and rather sooner than he had expected he found her emerging from a defense against the dark arts lessoner cho could i have a word with yougiggling should be made illegal harry thought furiously as all the girls around cho started doing it she didnt though she said okay and followed him out of earshot other classmatesharry turned to look at her and his stomach gave a weird lurch as though he had missed a step going downstairser he saidhe couldnt ask her he couldnt but he had to cho stood there looking puzzled watching him the words came out before harry had quite got his tongue around themwangoballwimesorry said chodyou dyou want to go to the ball with me said harry why did he have to go red now whyoh s aid cho and she went red too oh harry im really sorry and she truly looked it ive already said ill go with someone elseoh said harryit was odd a

said cedric diggoryoh right said harryhis insides had come back again it felt as though they had been filled with lead in their absencecompletely forgetting about dinner he walked slowly back up to gryffindor tower chos voice echoing in his ears with every step he took cedric cedric diggory he had been starting to quite like cedric prepared to overlook the fact that he had once beaten him at quidditch and was handsome and popular and nearly everyones favorite champion now he suddenly realized that cedric was in fact a useless pretty boy who didnt have enough brains to fill an eggcupfairy

for drastic actionwait here he said to ron and he stood up walked straight up to parvati and said parvati will you go to the ball with meparvati went into a fit of giggles harry waited for them to subside his fingers crossed in the pocket of his robesyes all right then she said finally blushing furiouslythanks said harry in relief lavender will you go with ronshes going with seamus said parvati and the pair of them giggled harder than everharry sighedcant you think of anyone whod go with ron he said lowering his voice so that ron wouldnt hearwhat about hermione granger said parvatishes going

ask her if you likeyeah that would be great said harry let me know will youand he went back over to ron feeling that this ball was a lot more trouble than it was worth and hoping very much that padma patils nose was dead centerchapter twentythree the yule balldespite the very heavy load of homework that the fourth years had been given for the holidays harry was in no mood to work when term ended and spent the week leading up to christmas enjoying himself as fully as possible along with everyone else gryffindor tower was hardly less crowded now than during termtime it seemed to have shrunk slightly too as its inhabitants were being so much rowdier than usual fred and george had had a great success with their canary creams and for the first couple of days of the holidays people kept bursting into feather all over the place before long however all the gryffindors had learned to treat food anybody else offered them with extreme caution in case it had a canary cream concealed in the center and george confided to harry that he and fred were now working on developing something else harry made a mental note never to accept so much as a crisp from fred and george in future he still hadnt forgotten dudley and the tontongue toffeesnow was falling thickly upon the castle and its grounds now the pale blue beauxbatons carriage looked like a large chilly frosted pumpkin next to the iced gingerbread house that was hagrids cabin while the durmstrang ships portholes were glazed with ice the rigging white with frost the houseelves down in the kitchen were outdoing themselves with a series of rich warming stews and savory puddings and only fleur delacour seemed to be able to find anything to complain aboutit is too eavy all zis ogwarts food they heard her saying grumpily as they left the great hall behind her one evening ron skulking behind harry keen not to be spotted by fleur 	i will not fit into my dress robesoooh theres a tragedy hermione snapped as fleur went out into the entrance hall she really thinks a lot of herself that one doesnt shehermione who are you going to the ball with said ronhe kept springing this question on her hoping to startle her into a response by asking it when she least expected it however hermione merely frowned and said im not telling you youll just make fun of meyoure joking weasley said malfoy behind them youre not telling me someones asked that to the ball not the longmolared mudblood harry and ron both whipped around but hermione said loudly waving to somebody over malfoys shoulder hello professor moodymalfoy went pale and jumped backward looking wildly around for moody but he was still up at the staff table finishing his stewtwitchy little ferret arent you malfoy said hermione scathingly and she harry and ron went up the marble staircase laughing heartilyhermione said ron looking sideways at her suddenly frowning your teeth what about them she saidwell theyre different ive just noticed of course they are did you expect me to keep those fangs malfoy gave meno i mean theyre different to how they were before he put that hex on you theyre all straight and and normalsizedhermione suddenly smiled very mischievously and harry noticed it too it was a very different smile from the one he rememberedwell when i went up to madam pomfrey to get them shrunk she held up a mirror and told me to stop her when they were back to how they normally were she said and i just let her carry on a bit she smiled even more widely mum and dad wont be too pleased ive been trying to persuade them to let me shrink them for ages but they wanted me to carry on with my braces you know theyre dentists they just dont think teeth and magic should look pigwidgeons backrons tiny owl was twittering madly on the top of the icicleladen banisters a scroll of parchment tied to his leg people passing him were pointing and laughing and a group of thirdyear girls paused and said oh look at the weeny owl isnt he cutestupid little feathery git ron hissed hurrying up the stairs and snatching up pigwidgeon you bring letters to the addressee you dont hang around showing offpigwidgeon hooted happily his head protruding over rons fist the thirdyear girls all looked very shockedclear off ron snapped at them waving the fist holding pigwidgeon who hooted more happily than ever as he soared through the air here take it harry ron added in an undertone as the thirdyear girls scuttled away looking scandalized he pulled siriuss reply off pigwidgeons leg harry pocketed it and they hurried back to gryffindor tower to read iteveryone in the common room was much too busy in letting off more holiday steam to observe what anyone else was up to ron harry and hermione sat apart from everyone else by a dark window that was gradually filling up with snow and harry read outdear harrycongratulations on getting past the horntail whoever put your name in that goblet shouldnt be feeling too happy right now i was going to suggest a conjunctivitus curse as a dragons eyes are its weakest point thats what krum did hermione whispered but your way was better im impresseddont get complacent though harry youve only done one task whoever put you in for the tournaments got plenty more opportunity if theyre trying to hurt you keep your eyes open particularly when the person we discussed is around and concentrate on keeping yourself out of troublekeep in touch i still want to hear about anything unusualsiriushe sounds exactly like moody said harry quietly tucking the letter away again inside his robes constant vigilance youd think i walk around with my eyes shut banging off the walls but hes right harry said hermione you have still got two tasks to do you really ought to have a look at that egg you know and start working out what it means hermione hes got ages snapped ron want a game of chess harryyeah okay said harry then spotting the look on hermiones face he said come on howm i supposed to concentrate with all this noise going on i wont even be able to hear the egg over this lotoh i suppose not she sighed and she sat down to watch their chess match which culminated in an exciting checkmate of rons involving a couple of recklessly brave pawns and a very violent bishopharry awoke very suddenly on christmas day wondering what had caused his abrupt return to consciousness he opened his eyes and saw something with very large round green eyes staring back at him in the darkness so close they were almost nose to nosedobby harry yelled scrambling away from the elf so fast he almost fell out of bed dont do thatdobby is sorry sir squeaked dobby anxiously jumping backward with his long fingers over his mouth dobby is only wanting to wish harry potter merry christmas and bring him a present sir harry potter did say dobby could come and see him sometimes sirits okay said harry still breathing rather faster than usual while his heart rate returned to normal just just prod me or something in future all right dont bend over me like that harry pulled back the curtains around his fourposter took his glasses from his bedside table and put them on his yell had awoken ron seamus dean and neville all of them were peering through the gaps in their own hangings heavyeyed and touslehairedsomeone attacking you harry seamus asked sleepilyno its just dobby harry muttered go back to sleepnah presents said seamus spotting the large pile at the foot of his bed ron dean and neville decided that now they were awake they might as well get down to some presentopening too harry turned back to dobby who was now standing nervously next to harrys bed still looking worried that he had upset harry there was a christmas bauble tied to the loop on top of his tea cozycan dobby give harry potter his present he squeaked tentativelycourse you can said harry er ive got something for you tooit was a lie he hadnt bought anything for dobby at all but he quickly opened his trunk and pulled out a particularly knobbly rolledup pair of socks they were his oldest and foulest mustard yellow and had once belonged to uncle vernon the reason they were extraknobbly was that harry had been using them to cushion his sneakoscope for over a year now he pulled out the sneakoscope and handed the socks to dobby saying sorry i forgot to wrap thembut dobby was utterly delightedsocks are dobbys favorite favorite clothes sir he said ripping off his odd ones and pulling on uncle vernons i has seven now sir but sir he said his eyes widening having pulled both socks up to their highest extent so that they reached to the bottom of his shorts they has made a mistake in the shop harry potter they is giving you two the sameah no harry how come you didnt spot that said ron grinning over from his own bed which was now strewn with wrapping paper tell you what dobby here you go take these two and you can mix them up properly and heres your sweaterhe threw dobby a pair of violet socks he had just unwrapped and the handknitted sweater mrs weasley had sent dobby looked quite overwhelmedsir is very kind he squeaked his eyes brimming with tears again bowing deeply to ron dobby knew sir must be a great wizard for he is harry potters greatest friend but dobby did not know that he was also as generous of spirit as noble as selfless theyre only socks said ron who had gone slightly pink around the ears though he looked rather pleased all the same wow harry he had just opened harrys present a chudley cannon hat cool he jammed it onto his head where it clashed horribly with his hairdobby now handed harry a small package which turned out to be socksdobby is making them himself sir the elf said happily he is buying the wool out of his wages sirthe left sock was bright red and had a pattern of broomsticks upon it the right sock was green with a pattern of snitchestheyre theyre really well thanks dobby said harry and he pulled them on causing dobbys eyes to leak with happiness againdobby must go now sir we is already making christmas dinner in the kitchens said dobby and he hurried out of the dormitory waving goodbye to ron and the others as he passedharrys other presents were much more satisfactory than dobbys odd socks with the obvious exception of the dursleys which consisted of a single tissue an alltime low harry supposed they too were remember ing the tontongue toffee hermione had given harry a book called quidditch teams of britain and ireland ron a bulging bag of dungbombs sirius a handy penknife with attachments to unlock any lock and undo any knot and hagrid a vast box of sweets including all harrys favorites bertie botts every flavor beans chocolate frogs droobles best blowing gum and fizzing whizbees there was also of course mrs weasleys usual package including a new sweater green with a picture of a dragon on it harry supposed charlie had told her all about the horntail and a large quantity of homemade mince piesharry and ron met up with hermione in the common room and they went down to breakfast together they spent most of the morning in gryffindor tower where everyone was enjoying their presents then returned to the great hall for a magnificent lunch which included at least a hundred turkeys and christmas puddings and large piles of cribbages wizarding crackersthey went out onto the grounds in the afternoon the snow was untouched except for the deep channels made by the durmstrang and beauxbatons students on their way up to the castle hermione chose to watch harry and the weasleys snowball fight rather than join in and at five oclock said she was going back upstairs to get ready for the ballwhat you need three hours said ron looking at her incredulously and paying for his lapse in concentration when a large snowball thrown by george hit him hard on the side of the head whore you going with he yelled after hermione but she just waved and disappeared up the stone steps into the castlethere was no christmas tea today as the ball included a feast so at seven oclock when it had become hard to aim properly the others abandoned their snowball fight and trooped back to the common room the fat lady was sitting in her frame with her friend violet from downstairs both of them extremely tipsy empty boxes of chocolate liqueurs littering the bottom other picturelairy fights thats the one she giggled when they gave the password and she swung forward to let them insideharry ron seamus dean and neville changed into their dress robes up in their dormitory all of them looking very selfconscious but none as much as ron who surveyed himself in the long mirror in the corner with an appalled look on his face there was just no getting around the fact that his robes looked more like a dress than anything else in a desperate attempt to make them look more manly he used a severing charm on the ruff and cuffs it worked fairly well at least he was now lacefree although he hadnt done a very neat job and the edges still looked depressingly frayed as the boys set off downstairsi still cant work out how you two got the bestlooking girls in the year muttered deananimal magnetism said ron gloomily pulling stray threads out of his cuffsthe common room looked strange full of people wearing different colors instead of the usual mass of black parvati was waiting for harry at the foot of the stairs she looked very pretty indeed in robes of shocking pink with her long dark plait braided with gold and gold bracelets glimmering at her wrists harry was relieved to see that she wasnt gigglingyou er look nice he said awkwardlythanks she said padmas going to meet you in the entrance hall she added to ronright said ron looking around wheres hermioneparvati shrugged shall we go down then harryokay said harry wishing he could just stay in the common room fred winked at harry as he passed him on the way out of the portrait holethe entrance hall was packed with students too all milling around waiting for eight oclock when the doors to the great hall would be thrown open those people who were meeting partners from different houses were edging through the crowd trying to find one another parvati found her sister padma and led her over to harry and ronhi said padma who was looking just as pretty as parvati in robes of bright turquoise she didnt look too enthusiastic about having ron as a partner though her dark eyes lingered on the frayed neck and sleeves of his dress robes as she looked him up and downhi said ron not looking at her but staring around at the crowd oh no he bent his knees slightly to hide behind harry because fleur delacour was passing looking stunning in robes of silvergray satin and accompanied by the ravenclaw quidditch captain roger davies when they had disappeared ron stood straight again and stared over the heads of the crowdwhere is hermione he said againa group of slytherins came up the steps from their dungeon common room malfoy was in front he was wearing dress robes of black velvet with a high collar which in harrys opinion made him look like a vicar pansy parkinson in very frilly robes of pale pink was clutching malfoys arm crabbe and goyle were both wearing green they resembled mosscolored boulders and neither of them harry was pleased to see had managed to find a partnerthe oak front doors opened and everyone turned to look as the durmstrang students entered with professor karkaroff krum was at the front of the party accompanied by a pretty girl in blue robes harry didnt know over their heads he saw that an area of lawn right in front of the castle had been transformed into a sort of grotto full of fairy lights meaning hundreds of actual living fairies were sitting in the rosebushes that had been conjured there and fluttering over the statues of what seemed to be father christmas and his reindeerthen professor mcgonagalls voice called champions over here pleaseparvati readjusted her bangles beaming she and harry said see you in a minute to ron and padma and walked forward the chattering crowd parting to let them through professor mcgonagall who was wearing dress robes of red tartan and had arranged a rather ugly wreath of thistles around the brim other hat told them to wait on one side of the doors while everyone else went inside they were to enter the great hall in procession when the rest of the students had sat down fleur delacour and roger davies stationed themselves nearest the doors davies looked so stunned by his good fortune in having fleur for a partner that he could hardly take his eyes off her cedric and cho were close to harry too he looked away from them so he wouldnt have to talk to them his eyes fell instead on the girl next to krum his jaw droppedit was hermionebut she didnt look like hermione at all she had done something with her hair it was no longer bushy but sleek and shiny and twisted up into an elegant knot at the back of her head she was wearing robes made of a floaty periwinkleblue material and she was holding herself differently somehow or maybe it was merely the absence of the twenty or so books she usually had slung over her back she was also smiling rather nervously it was true but the reduction in the size of her front teeth was more noticeable than ever harry couldnt understand how he hadnt spotted it beforehi harry she said hi parvatiparvati was gazing at hermione in unflattering disbelief she wasnt the only one either when the doors to the great hall opened krums fan club from the library stalked past throwing hermione looks of deepest loathing pansy parkinson gaped at her as she walked by with malfoy and even he didnt seem to be able to find an insult to throw at her ron however walked right past hermione without looking at heronce everyone else was settled in the hall professor mcgonagall told the champions and their partners to get in line in pairs and to follow her they did so and everyone in the great hall applauded as they entered and started walking up toward a large round table at the top of the hall where the judges were sittingthe walls of the hall had all been covered in sparkling silver frost with hundreds of garlands of mistletoe and ivy crossing the starry black ceiling the house tables had vanished instead there were about a hundred smaller lanternlit ones each seating about a dozen peopleharry concentrated on not tripping over his feet parvati seemed to be enjoying herself she was beaming around at everybody steering harry so forcefully that he felt as though he were a show dog she was putting through its paces he caught sight of ron and padma as he neared the top table ron was watching hermione pass with narrowed eyes padma was looking sulkydumbledore smiled happily as the champions approached the top table but karkaroff wore an expression remarkably like rons as he watched krum and hermione draw nearer ludo bagman tonight in robes of bright purple with large yellow stars was clapping as enthusiastically as any of the students and madame maxime who had changed her usual uniform of black satin for a flowing gown of lavender silk was applauding them politely but mr crouch harry suddenly realized was not there the fifth seat at the table was occupied by percy weasleywhen the champions and their partners reached the table percy drew out the empty chair beside him staring pointedly at harry harry took the hint and sat down next to percy who was wearing brandnew navyblue dress robes and an expression of such smugness that harry thought it ought to be finedive been promoted percy said before harry could even ask and from his tone he might have been announcing his election as supreme ruler of the universe im now mr crouchs personal assistant and im here representing himwhy didnt he come harry asked he wasnt looking forward to being lectured on cauldron bottoms all through dinnerim afraid to say mr crouch isnt well not well at all hasnt been right since the world cup hardly surprising overwork hes not as young as he was though still quite brilliant of course the mind remains as great as it ever was but the world cup was a fiasco for the whole ministry and then mr crouch suffered a huge personal shock with the misbehavior of that houseelf of his blinky or whatever she was called naturally he dismissed her immediately afterward but well as i say hes getting on he needs looking after and i think hes found a definite drop in his home comforts since she left and then we had the tournament to arrange and the aftermath of the cup to deal with that revolting skeeter woman buzzing around no poor man hes having a well earned quiet christmas im just glad he knew he had someone he could rely upon to take his placeharry wanted very much to ask whether mr crouch had stopped calling percy weatherby yet but resisted the temptationthere was no food as yet on the glittering golden plates but small menus were lying in front of each of them harry picked his up uncertainly and looked around there were no waiters dumbledore however looked carefully down at his own menu then said very clearly to his plate pork chopsand pork chops appeared getting the idea the rest of the table placed their orders with their plates too harry glanced up at hermione to see how she felt about this new and more complicated method of dining surely it meant plenty of extra work for the houseelves but for once hermione didnt seem to be thinking about spew she was deep in talk with viktor krum and hardly seemed to notice what she was eatingit now occurred to harry that he had never actually heard krum speak before but he was certainly talking now and very enthusiastically at thatveil ve have a castle also not as big as this nor as comfortable i am thinking he was telling hermione ve have just four floors and the fires are lit only for magical purposes but ve have grounds larger even than these though in vinter ve have very little daylight so ve are not enjoying them but in summer ve are flying every day over the lakes and the mountains now now viktor said karkaroff with a laugh that didnt reach his cold eyes dont go giving away anything else now or your charming friend will know exactly where to find usdumbledore smiled his eyes twinkling igor all this secrecy one would almost think you didnt want visitorswell dumbledore said karkaroff displaying his yellowing teeth to their fullest extent we are all protective of our private domains are we not do we not jealously guard the halls of learning that have been entrusted to us are we not right to be proud that we alone know our schools secrets and right to protect themoh i would never dream of assuming i know all hogwarts secrets igor said dumbledore amicably only this morning for instance i took a wrong turning on the way to the bathroom and found myself in a beautifully proportioned room i have never seen before containing a really rather magnificent collection of chamber pots when i went back to investigate more closely i discovered that the room had vanished but i must keep an eye out for it possibly it is only accessible at fivethirty in the morning or it may only appear at the quarter moon or when the seeker has an exceptionally full bladderharry snorted into his plate of goulash percy frowned but harry could have sworn dumbledore had given him a very small winkmeanwhile fleur delacour was criticizing the hogwarts decorations to roger davieszis is nothing she said dismissively looking around at the sparkling walls of the great hall at ze palace of beauxbatons we ave ice sculptures all around ze dining chamber at chreestmas zey do not melt of course zey are like uge statues of diamond glittering around ze place and ze food is seemply superb and we ave choirs of wood nymphs oo serenade us as we eat we ave none of zis ugly armor in ze alls and eef a poltergeist ever entaired into beauxbatons e would be expelled like zat she slapped her hand onto the table impatientlyroger davies was watching her talk with a very dazed look on his face and he kept missing his mouth with his fork harry had the impression that davies was too busy staring at fleur to take in a word she was sayingabsolutely right he said quickly slapping his own hand down on the table in imitation of fleur like that yeahharry looked around the hall hagrid was sitting at one of the other staff tables he was back in his horrible hairy brown suit and gazing up at the top table harry saw him give a small wave and looking around saw madame maxime return it her opals glittering in the candlelighthermione was now teaching krum to say her name properly he kept calling her hermyownhermyohnee she said slowly and clearlyhermownninnyclose enough she said catching harrys eye and grinningwhen all the food had been consumed dumbledore stood up and asked the students to do the same then with a wave of his wand all the tables zoomed back along the walls leaving the floor clear and then he conjured a raised platform into existence along the right wall a set of drums several guitars a lute a cello and some bagpipes were set upon itthe weird sisters now trooped up onto the stage to wildly enthusiastic applause they were all extremely hairy and dressed in black robes that had been artfully ripped and torn they picked up their instruments and harry who had been so interested in watching them that he had almost forgotten what was coming suddenly realized that the lanterns on all the other tables had gone out and that the other champions and their partners were standing upcome on parvati hissed were supposed to danceharry tripped over his dress robes as he stood up the weird sisters struck up a slow mournful tune harry walked onto the brightly lit dance floor carefully avoiding catching anyones eye he could see seamus and dean waving at him and sniggering and next moment parvati had seized his hands placed one around her waist and was holding the other tightly in hersit wasnt as bad as it could have been harry thought revolving slowly on the spot parvati was steering he kept his eyes fixed over the heads of the watching people and very soon many of them too had come onto the dance floor so that the champions were no longer the center of attention neville and ginny were dancing nearby he could see ginny wincing frequently as neville trod on her feet and dumbledore was waltzing with madame maxime he was so dwarfed by her that the top of his pointed hat barely tickled her chin however she moved very gracefully for a woman so large madeye moody was doing an extremely ungainly twostep with professor sinistra who was nervously avoiding his wooden legnice socks potter moody growled as he passed his magical eye staring through harrys robesoh yeah dobby the houseelf knitted them for me said harry grinninghe is so creepy parvati whispered as moody clunked away i dont think that eye should be allowedharry heard the final quavering note from the bagpipe with relief the weird sisters stopped playing applause filled the hall once more and harry let go of parvati at oncelets sit down shall weoh but this is a really good one parvati said as the weird sisters struck up a new song which was much fasterno i dont like it harry lied and he led her away from the dance floor past fred and angelina who were dancing so exhuberantly that people around them were backing away in fear of injury and over to the table where ron and padma were sittinghows it going harry asked ron sitting down and opening a bottle of butterbeerron didnt answer he was glaring at hermione and krum who were dancing nearby padma was sitting with her arms and legs crossed one foot jiggling in time to the music every now and then she threw a disgruntled look at ron who was completely ignoring her parvati sat down on harrys other side crossed her arms and legs too and within minutes was asked to dance by a boy from beauxbatonsyou dont mind do you harry parvati saidwhat said harry who was now watching cho and cedricoh never mind snapped parvati and she went off with the boy from beauxbatons when the song ended she did not returnhermione came over and sat down in parvatis empty chair she was a bit pink in the face from dancinghi said harry ron didnt say anythingits hot isnt it said hermione fanning herself with her hand viktors just gone to get some drinksron gave her a withering look viktor he said hasnt he asked you to call him vicky yethermione looked at him in surprise whats up with you she saidif you dont know said ron scathingly im not going to tell youhermione stared at him then at harry who shruggedron what hes from durmstrang spat ron hes competing against harry against hogwarts you youre ron was obviously casting around for words strong enough to describe hermiones crime fraternizing with the enemy thats what youre doinghermiones mouth fell opendont be so stupid she said after a moment the enemy honestly who was the one who was all excited when they saw him arrive who was the one who wanted his autograph whos got a model of him up in their dormitoryron chose to ignore this i spose he asked you to come with him while you were both in the libraryyes he did said hermione the pink patches on her cheeks glowing more brightly so whatwhat happened trying to get him to join spew were youno i wasnt if you really want to know he he said hed been coming up to the library every day to try and talk to me but he hadnt been able to pluck up the couragehermione said this very quickly and blushed so deeply that she was the same color as parvatis robesyeah well thats his story said ron nastilyand whats that supposed to meanobvious isnt it hes karkaroffs student isnt he he knows who you hang around with hes just trying to get closer to harry get inside information on him or get near enough to jinx him hermione looked as though ron had slapped her when she spoke her voice quiveredfor your information he hasnt asked me one single thing about harry not one ron changed tack at the speed of lightthen hes hoping youll help him find out what his egg means i suppose youve been putting your heads together during those cozy little library sessions id never help him work out that egg said hermione looking outraged never how could you say something like that i want harry to win the tournament harry knows that dont you harryyouve got a funny way of showing it sneered ronthis whole tournaments supposed to be about getting to know foreign wizards and making friends with them said hermione hotlyno it isnt shouted ron its about winningpeople were starting to stare at themron said harry quietly i havent got a problem with hermione coming with krum but ron ignored harry toowhy dont you go and find vicky hell be wondering where you are said rondont call him vickyhermione jumped to her feet and stormed off across the dance floor disappearing into the crowd ron watched her go with a mixture of anger and satisfaction on his faceare you going to ask me to dance at all padma asked himno said ron still glaring after hermionefine snapped padma and she got up and went to join parvati and the beauxbatons boy who conjured up one of his friends to join them so fast that harry could have sworn he had zoomed him there by a summoning charmvare is hermownninny said a voicekrum

he slouched offmade friends with viktor krum have you ronpercy had bustled over rubbing his hands together and looking extremely pompous excellent thats the whole point you know international magical cooperationto harrys displeasure percy now took padmas vacated seat the top table was now empty professor dumbledore was dancing with professor sprout ludo bagman with professor mcgonagall madame maxime and hagrid were cutting a wide path around the dance floor as they waltzed through the students and karkaroff was nowhere to be seen when the next song ended everybody applauded once more and harry saw ludo bagman kiss professor mcgonagalls hand and make his way back through the crowds at which point fred and george accosted himwhat do they think theyre doing annoying senior ministry members percy hissed watching fred and george suspiciously no respectludo bagman shook off fred and george fairly quickly however and spotting harry waved and came over to their tablei hope my brothers werent bothering you mr bagman said percy at oncewhat oh not at all not at all said bagman no they were just telling me a bit more about those fake wands of theirs wondering if i could advise them on the marketing ive promised to put them in touch with a couple of contacts of mine at zonkos joke shop percy didnt look happy about this at all and harry was prepared to bet he would be rushing to tell mrs weasley about this the moment he got home apparently fred and georges plans had grown even more ambitious lately if they were hoping to sell to the public bagman opened his mouth to ask harry something but percy diverted himhow do you feel the tournaments going mr bagman our departments quite satisfied the hitch with the goblet of fire he glanced at harry was a little unfortunate of course but it seems to have gone very smoothly since dont you thinkoh yes bagman said cheerfully its all been enormous fun hows old barty doing shame he couldnt comeoh im sure mr crouch will be up and about in no time said percy importantly but in the meantime im more than willing to take up the slack of course its not all attending balls he laughed airily oh no ive had to deal with all sorts of things that have cropped up in his absence you heard ali bashir was caught smuggling a consignment of flying carpets into the country and then weve been trying to persuade the transylvanians to sign the international ban on dueling ive got a meeting with their head of magical cooperation in the new year lets go for a walk ron muttered to harry get away from percy pretending they wanted more drinks harry and ron left the table edged around the dance floor and slipped out into the entrance hall the front doors stood open and the fluttering fairy lights in the rose garden winked and twinkled as they went down the front steps where they found themselves surrounded by bushes winding ornamental paths and large stone statues harry could hear splashing water which sounded like a fountain here and there people were sitting on carved benches he and ron set off along one of the winding paths through the rosebushes but they had gone only a short way when they heard an unpleasantly familiar voicedont see what there is to fuss about igorseverus you cannot pretend this isnt happening karkaroffs voice sounded anxious and hushed as though keen not to be overheard its been getting clearer and clearer for months i am becoming seriously concerned i cant deny it then flee said snapes voice curtly flee i will make your excuses i however am remaining at hogwartssnape and karkaroff came around the corner snape had his wand out and was blasting rosebushes apart his expression most illnatured squeals issued from many of the bushes and dark shapes emerged from themten points from ravenclaw fawcett snape snarled as a girl ran past him and ten points from hufflepuff too stebbins as a boy went rushing after her and what are you two doing he added catching sight of harry and ron on the path ahead karkaroff harry saw looked slightly discomposed to see them standing there his hand went nervously to his goatee and he began winding it around his fingerwe re walking ron told snape shortly not against the law is itkeep walking then snape snarled and he brushed past them his long black cloak billowing out behind him karkaroff hurried away after snape harry and ron continued down the pathwhats got karkaroff all worried ron mutteredand since when have he and snape been on firstname termssaid harry slowlythey had reached a large stone reindeer now over which they could see the sparkling jets of a tall fountain the shadowy outlines of two enormous people were visible on a stone bench watching the water in the moonlight and then harry heard hagrid speakmomen i saw yeh i knew he was saying in an oddly husky voiceharry and ron froze this didnt sound like the sort of scene they ought to walk in on somehow harry looked around back up the path and saw fleur delacour and roger davies standing halfconcealed in a rosebush nearby he tapped ron on the shoulder and jerked his head toward them meaning that they could easily sneak off that way without being noticed fleur and davies looked very busy to harry but ron eyes widening in horror at the sight of fleur shook his head vigorously and pulled harry deeper into the shadows behind the reindeerwhat did you know agrid said madame maxime a purr in her low voiceharry definitely didnt want to listen to this he knew hagrid would hate to be overheard in a situation like this he certainly would have if it had been possible he would have put his fingers in his ears and hummed loudly but that wasnt really an option instead he tried to interest himself in a beetle crawling along the stone reindeers back but the beetle just wasnt interesting enough to block out hagrids next wordsi jus knew knew you were like me was it yer mother or yer fatheri i dont know what you mean agrid it was my mother said hagrid quietly she was one o the las ones in britain course i can remember her too well she left see when i was abou three she wasn really the maternal sort well its not in their natures is it dunno what happened to her might be dead fer all i know madame maxime didnt say anything and harry in spite of himself took his eyes off the beetle and looked over the top of the reindeers antlers listening he had never heard hagrid talk about his childhood beforeme dad was brokenhearted when she wen tiny little bloke my dad was by the time i was six i could lift him up an put him on top o the dresser if he annoyed me used ter make him laugh hagrids deep voice broke madame maxime was listening motionless apparently staring at the silvery fountain dad raised me but he died o course jus after i started school sorta had ter make me own way after that dumbledore was a real help mind very kind ter me he was hagrid pulled out a large spotted silk handkerchief and blew his nose heavilyso anyway enough abou me what about you which side you got it onbut madame maxime had suddenly got to her feetit is chilly she said but whatever the weather was doing it was nowhere near as cold as her voice i think i will go in noweh said hagrid blankly no don go ive ive never met another one beforeanuzzer what precisely said madame maxime her tone icyharry could have told hagrid it was best not to answer he stood there in the shadows gritting his teeth hoping against hope he wouldnt but it was no good another halfgiant o course said hagridow dare you shrieked madame maxime her voice exploded through the peaceful night air like a foghorn behind him harry heard fleur and roger fall out of their rosebush i ave nevair been more insulted in my life alfgiant moi i ave i ave big bonesshe stormed away great multicolored swarms of fairies rose into the air as she passed angrily pushing aside bushes hagrid was still sitting on the bench staring after her it was much too dark to make out his expression then after about a minute he stood up and strode away not back to the castle but off out into the dark grounds in the direction of his cabincmon harry said very quietly to ron lets go but ron didnt movewhats up said harry looking at himron looked around at harry his expression very serious indeeddid you know he whispered about hagrid being halfgiantno harry said shrugging so whathe knew immediately from the look ron was giving him that he was once again revealing his ignorance of the wizarding world brought up by the dursleys there were many things that wizards took for granted that were revelations to harry but these surprises had become fewer with each successive year now however he could tell that most wizards would not have said so what upon finding out that one of their friends had a giantess for a motherill explain inside said ron quietly cmon fleur and roger davies had disappeared probably into a more private clump of bushes harry and ron returned to the great hall parvati and padma were now sitting at a distant table with a whole crowd of beauxbatons boys and hermione was once more dancing with krum harry and ron sat down at a table far removed from the dance floorso harry prompted ron whats the problem with giantswell theyre theyre ron struggled for words not very nice he finished lamelywho cares harry said theres nothing wrong with hagridi know there isnt but blimey no wonder he keeps it quiet ron said shaking his head i always thought hed got in the way of a bad engorgement charm when he was a kid or something didnt like to mention it but whats it matter if his mother was a giantess said harrywell no one who knows him will care cos theyll know hes not dangerous said ron slowly but harry theyre just vicious giants its like hagrid said its in their natures theyre like trolls they just like killing everyone knows that there arent any left in britain now thoughwhat happened to themwell they were dying out anyway and then loads got themselves killed by aurors therere supposed to be giants abroad though they hide out in mountains mostly i dont know who maxime thinks shes kidding harry said watching madame maxime sitting alone at the judges table looking very somber if hagrids halfgiant she definitely is big bones the only thing thats got bigger bones than her is a dinosaurharry and ron spent the rest of the ball discussing giants in their corner neither of them having any inclination to dance harry tried not to watch cho and cedric too much it gave him a strong desire to kick somethingwhen the weird sisters finished playing at midnight everyone gave them a last loud round of applause and started to wend their way into the entrance hall many people were expressing the wish that the ball could have gone on longer but harry was perfectly happy to be going to bed as far as he was concerned the evening hadnt been much funout in the entrance hall harry and ron saw hermione saying good night to krum before he went back to the durmstrang ship she gave ron a very cold look and swept past him up the marble staircase without speaking harry and ron followed her but halfway up the staircase harry heard someone calling himheyharryit was cedric diggory harry could see cho waiting for him in the entrance hall belowyeah said harry coldly as cedric ran up the stairs toward himcedric looked as though he didnt want to say whatever it was in front of ron who shrugged looking badtempered and continued to climb the stairslisten cedric lowered his voice as ron disappeared i owe you one for telling me about the dragons you know that golden egg does yours wail when you open ityeah said harrywell take a bath okaywhattake a bath and er take the egg with you and er just mull things over in the hot water itll help you think trust meharry stared at himtell you what cedric said use the prefects bathroom fourth door to the left of that statue of boris the bewildered on the fifth floor passwords pine fresh gotta go want to say good night he grinned at harry again and hurried back down the stairs to choharry walked back to gryffindor tower alone that had been extremely strange advice why would a bath help him to work out what the wailing egg meant was cedric pulling his leg was he trying to make harry look like a fool so cho would like him even more by comparisonthe fat lady and her friend vi were snoozing in the picture over the portrait hole harry had to yell fairy lights before he woke them up and when he did they were extremely irritated he climbed into the common room and found ron and hermione having a blazing row standing ten feet apart they were bellowing at each other each scarlet in the facewell if you dont like it you know what the solution is dont you yelled hermione her hair was coming down out of its elegant bun now and her face was screwed up in angeroh yeah ron yelled back whats thatnext time theres a ball ask me before someone else does and not as a last resortron mouthed soundlessly like a goldfish out of water as hermione turned on her heel and stormed up the girls staircase to bed ron turned to look at harrywell he sputtered looking thunderstruck well that just proves completely missed the point harry didnt say anything he liked being back on speaking terms with ron too much to speak his mind right now but he somehow thought that hermione had gotten the point much better than ron hadchapter twentyfour rita skeeters scoopeverybody got up late on boxing day the gryffindor common room was much quieter than it had been lately many yawns punctuating the lazy conversations hermiones hair was bushy again she confessed to harry that she had used liberal amounts of sleekeazys hair potion on it for the ball but its way too much bother to do every day she said matteroffactly scratching a purring crookshanks behind the earsron and hermione seemed to have reached an unspoken agreement not to discuss their argument they were being quite friendly to each other though oddly formal ron and harry wasted no time in telling hermione about the conversation they had overheard between madame maxime and hagrid but hermione didnt seem to find the news that hagrid was a halfgiant nearly as shocking as ron didwell i thought he must be she said shrugging i knew he couldnt be pure giant because theyre about twenty feet tall but honestly all this hysteria about giants they cant all be horrible its the same sort of prejudice that people have toward werewolves its just bigotry isnt itron looked as though he would have liked to reply scathingly but perhaps he didnt want another row because he contented himself with shaking his head disbelievingly while hermione wasnt lookingit was time now to think of the homework they had neglected during the first week of the holidays everybody seemed to be feeling rather flat now that christmas was over everybody except harry that is who was starting once again to feel slightly nervousthe trouble was that february the twentyfourth looked a lot closer from this side of christmas and he still hadnt done anything about working out the clue inside the golden egg he therefore started taking the egg out of his trunk every time he went up to the dormitory opening it and listening intently hoping that this time it would make some sense he strained to think what the sound reminded him of apart from thirty musical saws but he had never heard anything else like it he closed the egg shook it vigorously and opened it again to see if the sound had changed but it hadnt he tried asking the egg questions shouting over all the wailing but nothing happened he even threw the egg across the room though he hadnt really expected that to helpharry had not forgotten the hint that cedric had given him but his lessthanfriendly feelings toward cedric just now meant that he was keen not to take his help if he could avoid it in any case it seemed to him that if cedric had really wanted to give harry a hand he would have been a lot more explicit he harry had told cedric exactly what was coming in the first task and cedrics idea of a fair exchange had been to tell harry to take a bath well he didnt need that sort of rubbishy help not from someone who kept walking down corridors hand in hand with cho anyway and so the first day of the new term arrived and harry set off to lessons weighed down with books parchment and quills as usual but also with the lurking worry of the egg heavy in his stomach as though he were carrying that around with him toosnow was still thick upon the grounds and the greenhouse windows were covered in condensation so thick that they couldnt see out of them in herbology nobody was looking forward to care of magical creatures much in this weather though as ron said the skrewts would probably warm them up nicely either by chasing them or blasting off so forcefully that hagrids cabin would catch firewhen they arrived at hagrid s cabin however they found an elderly witch with closely cropped gray hair and a very prominent chin standing before his front doorhurry up now the bell rang five minutes ago she barked at them as they struggled toward her through the snowwhore you said ron staring at her wheres hagrid my name is professor grubblyplank she said briskly i am your temporary care of magical creatures teacher wheres hagrid harry repeated loudly he is indisposed said professor grubblyplank shortly soft and unpleasant laughter reached harrys ears he turned draco malfoy and the rest of the slytherins were joining the class all of them looked gleeful and none of them looked surprised to see professor grubblyplankthis way please said professor grubblyplank and she strode off around the paddock where the beauxbatons horses were shivering harry ron and hermione followed her looking back over their shoulders at hagrids cabin all the curtains were closed was hagrid in there alone and illwhats wrong with hagrid harry said hurrying to catch up with professor grubblyplanknever you mind she said as though she thought he was being nosyi do mind though said harry hotly whats up with himprofessor grubblyplank acted as though she couldnt hear him she led them past the paddock where the huge beauxbatons horses were standing huddled against the cold and toward a tree on the edge of the forest where a large and beautiful unicorn was tetheredmany of the girls ooooohed at the sight of the unicornoh its so beautiful whispered lavender brown how did she get it theyre supposed to be really hard to catchthe unicorn was so brightly white it made the snow all around look gray it was pawing the ground nervously with its golden hooves and throwing back its horned headboys keep back barked professor grubblyplank throwing out an arm and catching harry hard in the chest they prefer the womans touch unicorns girls to the front and approach with care come on easy does it she and the girls walked slowly forward toward the unicorn leaving the boys standing near the paddock fence watching the moment professor grubblyplank was out of earshot harry turned to ronwhat dyou reckons wrong with him you dont think a skrewt oh he hasnt been attacked potter if thats what youre thinking said malfoy softly no hes just too ashamed to show his big ugly facewhat dyou mean said harry sharplymalfoy put his hand inside the pocket of his robes and pulled out a folded page of newsprintthere you go he said hate to break it to you potter he smirked as harry snatched the page unfolded it and read it with ron seamus dean and neville looking over his shoulder it was an article topped with a picture of hagrid looking extremely shiftydumbledores giant mistakealbus dumbledore eccentric headmaster of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry has never been afraid to make controversial staff appointments writes rita skeeter special correspondent in september of this year he hired alastor madeye moody the notoriously jinxhappy exauror to teach defense against the dark arts a decision that caused many raised eyebrows at the ministry of magic given moodys wellknown habit of attacking anybody who makes a sudden movement in his presence madeye moody however looks responsible and kindly when set beside the parthuman dumbledore employs to teach care of magical creaturesrubeus hagrid who admits to being expelled from hogwarts in his third year has enjoyed the position of gamekeeper at the school ever since a job secured for him by dumbledore last year however hagrid used his mysterious influence over the headmaster to secure the additional post of care of magical creatures teacher over the heads of many betterqualified candidatesan alarmingly large and ferociouslooking man hagrid has been using his newfound authority to terrify the students in his care with a succession of horrific creatures while dumbledore turns a blind eye hagrid has maimed several pupils during a series of lessons that many admit to being very frighteningi was attacked by a hippogriff and my friend vincent crabbe got a bad bite off a flobberworm says draco malfoy a fourthyear student we all hate hagrid but were just too scared to say anythinghagrid has no intention of ceasing his campaign of intimidation however in conversation with a daily prophet reporter last month he admitted breeding creatures he has dubbed blastended skrewts highly dangerous crosses between manticores and firecrabs the creation of new breeds of magical creature is of course an activity usually closely observed by the department for the regulation and control of magical creatures hagrid however considers himself to be above such petty restrictionsi was just having some fun he says before hastily changing the subjectas if this were not enough the daily prophet has now unearthed evidence that hagrid is not as he has always pretended a pureblood wizard he is not in fact even pure human his mother we can exclusively reveal is none other than the giantess fridwulfa whose whereabouts are currently unknownbloodthirsty and brutal the giants brought themselves to the point of extinction by warring amongst themselves during the last century the handful that remained joined the ranks of hewhomustnotbenamed and were responsible for some of the worst mass muggle killings of his reign of terrorwhile many of the giants who served hewhomustnotbenamed were killed by aurors working against the dark side fridwulfa was not among them it is possible she escaped to one of the giant communities still existing in foreign mountain ranges if his antics during care of magical creatures lessons are any guide however fridwulfas son appears to have inherited her brutal naturein a bizarre twist hagrid is reputed to have developed a close friendship with the boy who brought around youknowwhos fall from power thereby driving hagrids own mother like the rest of youknowwhos supporters into hiding perhaps harry potter is unaware of the unpleasant truth about his large friend but albus dumbledore surely has a duty to ensure that harry potter along with his fellow students is warned about the dangers of associating with partgiantsharry finished reading and looked up at ron whose mouth was hanging openhow did she find out he whisperedbut that wasnt what was bothering harrywhat dyou mean we all hate hagrid harry spat at malfoy whats this rubbish about him he pointed at crabbe getting a bad bite off a flobberworm they havent even got teethcrabbe was sniggering apparently very pleased with himselfwell i think this should put an end to the oafs teaching career said malfoy his eyes glinting halfgiant and there was me thinking hed just swallowed a bottle of skelegro when he was young none of the mummies and daddies are going to like this at all theyll be worried hell eat their kids ha ha youare you paying attention over thereprofessor grubblyplanks voice carried over to the boys the girls were all clustered around the unicorn now stroking it harry was so angry that the daily prophet article shook in his hands as he turned to stare unseeingly at the unicorn whose many magical properties professor grubblyplank was now enumerating in a loud voice so that the boys could hear tooi hope she stays that woman said parvati patil when the lesson had ended and they were all heading back to the castle for lunch thats more what i thought care of magical creatures would be like proper creatures like unicorns not monsters what about hagrid harry said angrily as they went up the stepswhat about him said parvati in a hard voice he can still be gamekeeper cant heparvati had been very cool toward harry since the ball he supposed that he ought to have paid her a bit more attention but she seemed to have had a good time all the same she was certainly telling anybody who would listen that she had made arrangements to meet the boy from beauxbatons in hogsmeade on the next weekend tripthat was a really good lesson said hermione as they entered the great hall i didnt know half the things professor grubblyplank told us about uni look at this harry snarled and he shoved the daily prophet article under hermiones nosehermiones mouth fell open as she read her reaction was exactly the same as ronshow did that horrible skeeter woman find out you dont think hagrid told herno said harry leading the way over to the gryffindor table and throwing himself into a chair furious he never even told us did he i reckon she was so mad he wouldnt give her loads of horrible stuff about me she went ferreting around to get him backmaybe she heard him telling madame maxime at the ball said hermione quietlywed have seen her in the garden said ron anyway shes not supposed to come into school anymore hagrid said dumbledore banned her maybe shes got an invisibility cloak said harry ladling chicken casserole onto his plate and splashing it everywhere in his anger sort of thing shed do isnt it hide in bushes listening to peoplelike you and ron did you mean said hermione we werent trying to hear him said ron indignantly we didnt have any choice the stupid prat talking about his giantess mother where anyone could have heard himweve got to go and see him said harry this evening after divination tell him we want him back you do want him back he shot at hermionei well im not going to pretend it didnt make a nice change having a proper care of magical creatures lesson for once but i do want hagrid back of course i do hermione added hastily quailing under harrys furious stareso that evening after dinner the three of them left the castle once more and went down through the frozen grounds to hagrids cabin they knocked and fangs booming barks answeredhagrid its us harry shouted pounding on the door open uphagrid didnt answer they could hear fang scratching at the door whining but it didnt open they hammered on it for ten more minutes ron even went and banged on one of the windows but there was no responsewhats he avoiding us for hermione said when they had finally given up and were walking back to the school he surely doesnt think wed care about him being halfgiantbut it seemed that hagrid did care they didnt see a sign of him all week he didnt appear at the staff table at mealtimes they didnt see him going about his gamekeeper duties on the grounds and professor grubblyplank continued to take the care of magical creatures classes malfoy was gloating at every possible opportunitymissing your halfbreed pal he kept whispering to harry whenever there was a teacher around so that he was safe from harrys retaliation missing the elephantmanthere was a hogsmeade visit halfway through january hermione was very surprised that harry was going to goi just thought youd want to take advantage of the common room being quiet she said really get to work on that eggoh i i reckon ive got a pretty good idea what its about now harry liedhave you really said hermione looking impressed well doneharrys insides gave a guilty squirm but he ignored them he still had five weeks to work out that egg clue after all and that was ages whereas if he went into hogsmeade he might run into hagrid and get a chance to persuade him to come backhe ron and hermione left the castle together on saturday and set off through the cold wet grounds toward the gates as they passed the durmstrang ship moored in the lake they saw viktor krum emerge onto the deck dressed in nothing but swimming trunks he was very skinny indeed but apparently a lot tougher than he looked because he climbed up onto the side of the ship stretched out his arms and dived right into the lakehes mad said harry staring at krums dark head as it bobbed out into the middle of the lake it must be freezing its januaryits a lot colder where he comes from said hermione i suppose it feels quite warm to himyeah but theres still the giant squid said ron he didnt sound anxious if anything he sounded hopeful hermione noticed his tone of voice and frownedhes really nice you know she said hes not at all like youd think coming from durmstrang he likes it much better here he told meron said nothing he hadnt mentioned viktor krum since the ball but harry had found a miniature arm under his bed on boxing day which had looked very much as though it had been snapped off a small model figure wearing bulgarian quidditch robesharry kept his eyes skinned for a sign of hagrid all the way down the slushy high street and suggested a visit to the three broomsticks once he had ascertained that hagrid was not in any of the shopsthe pub was as crowded as ever but one quick look around at all the tables told harry that hagrid wasnt there heart sinking he went up to the bar with ron and hermione ordered three butterbeers from madam rosmerta and thought gloomily that he might just as well have stayed behind and listened to the egg wailing after alldoesnt he ever go into the office hermione whispered suddenly lookshe pointed into the mirror behind the bar and harry saw ludo bagman reflected there sitting in a shadowy corner with a bunch of goblins bagman was talking very fast in a low voice to the goblins all of whom had their arms crossed and were looking rather menacingit was indeed odd harry thought that bagman was here at the three broomsticks on a weekend when there was no triwizard event and therefore no judging to be done he watched bagman in the mirror he was looking strained again quite as strained as he had that night in the forest before the dark mark had appeared but just then bagman glanced over at the bar saw harry and stood upin a moment in a moment harry heard him say brusquely to the goblins and bagman hurried through the pub toward harry his boyish grin back in placeharry he said how are you been hoping to run into you everything going all rightfine thanks said harrywonder if i could have a quick private word harry said bagman eagerly you couldnt give us a moment you two could youer okay said ron and he and hermione went off to find a tablebagman led harry along the bar to the end furthest from madam rosmertawell i just thought id congratulate you again on your splendid performance against that horntail harry said bagman really superbthanks said harry but he knew this couldnt be all that bagman wanted to say because he could have congratulated harry in front of ron and hermione bagman didnt seem in any particular rush to spill the beans though harry saw him glance into the mirror over the bar at the goblins who were all watching him and harry in silence through their dark slanting eyesabsolute nightmare said bagman to harry in an undertone noticing harry watching the goblins too their english isnt too good its like being back with all the bulgarians at the quidditch world cup but at least they used sign language another human could recognize this lot keep gabbling in gobbledegook and i only know one word of gobbledegook bladvak it means pickax i dont like to use it in case they think im threatening themhe gave a short booming laughwhat do they want harry said noticing how the goblins were still watching bagman very closelyer well said bagman looking suddenly nervous they er theyre looking for barty crouchwhy are they looking for him here said harry hes at the ministry in london isnt heer as a matter of fact ive no idea where he is said bagman hes sort of stopped coming to work been absent for a couple of weeks now young percy his assistant says hes ill apparently hes just been sending instructions in by owl but would you mind not mentioning that to anyone harry because rita skeeters still poking around everywhere she can and im willing to bet shed work up bartys illness into something sinister probably say hes gone missing like bertha jorkinshave you heard anything about bertha jorkins harry askedno said bagman looking strained again ive got people looking of course about time thought harry and its all very strange she definitely arrived in albania because she met her second cousin there and then she left the cousins house to go south and see an aunt and she seems to have vanished without trace en route blowed if i can see where shes got to she doesnt seem the type to elope for instance but still what are we doing talking about goblins and bertha jorkins i really wanted to ask you he lowered his voice how are you getting on with your golden egger not bad harry said untruthfullybagman seemed to know he wasnt being honestlisten harry he said still in a very low voice i feel very bad about all this you were thrown into this tournament you didnt volunteer for it and if his voice was so quiet now harry had to lean closer to listen if i can help at all a prod in the right direction ive taken a liking to you the way you got past that dragon well just say the wordharry stared up into bagmans round rosy face and his wide babyblue eyeswere supposed to work out the clues alone arent we he said careful to keep his voice casual and not sound as though he was accusing the head of the department of magical games and sports of breaking the ruleswell well yes said bagman impatiently but come on harry we all want a hogwarts victory dont wehave you offered cedric help harry saidthe smallest of frowns creased bagmans smooth face no i havent he said i well like i say ive taken a liking to you just thought id offer well thanks said harry but i think im nearly there with the egg couple more days should crack ithe wasnt entirely sure why he was refusing bagmans help except that bagman was almost a stranger to him and accepting his assistance would feel somehow much more like cheating than asking advice from ron hermione or siriusbagman looked almost affronted but couldnt say much more as fred and george turned up at that pointhello mr bagman said fred brightly can we buy you a drinker no said bagman with a last disappointed glance at harry no thank you boys fred and george looked quite as disappointed as bagman who was surveying harry as though he had let him down badlywell i must dash he said nice seeing you all good luck harryhe hurried out of the pub the goblins all slid off their chairs and exited after him harry went to rejoin ron and hermione what did he want ron said the moment harry had sat downhe offered to help me with the golden egg said harryhe shouldnt be doing that said hermione looking very shocked hes one of the judges and anyway youve already worked it out havent youer nearly said harrywell i dont think dumbledore would like it if he knew bagman was trying to persuade you to cheat said hermione still looking deeply disapproving i hope hes trying to help cedric as muchhes not i asked said harrywho cares if diggorys getting help said ron harry privately agreedthose goblins didnt look very friendly said hermione sipping her butterbeer what were they doing herelooking for crouch according to bagman said harry hes still ill hasnt been into workmaybe percys poisoning him said ron probably thinks if crouch snuffs it hell be made head of the department of international magical cooperationhermione gave ron a dontjokeaboutthingslikethat look and said funny goblins looking for mr crouch theyd normally deal with the department for the regulation and control of magical creaturescrouch can speak loads of different languages though said harry maybe they need an interpreterworrying about poor ickle goblins now are you ron asked hermione thinking of starting up spug or something society for the protection of ugly goblinsha ha ha said hermione sarcastically goblins dont need protection havent you been listening to what professor binns has been telling us about goblin rebellionsno said harry and ron togetherwell there quite capable of dealing with wizards said hermione taking another sip of butterbeer theyre very clever theyre not like houseelves who never stick up for themselvesuhoh said ron staring at the doorrita skeeter had just entered she was wearing bananayellow robes today her long nails were painted shocking pink and she was accompanied by her paunchy photographer she bought drinks and she and the photographer made their way through the crowds to a table nearby harry ron and hermione glaring at her as she approached she was talking fast and looking very satisfied about somethingdidnt seem very keen to talk to us did he bozo now why would that be do you think and whats he doing with a pack of goblins in tow anyway showing them the sights what nonsense he was always a bad liar reckon somethings up think we should do a bit of digging disgraced exhead of magical games and sports ludo bagman snappy start to a sentence bozo we just need to find a story to fit it trying to ruin someone elses life said harry loudlya few people looked around rita skeeters eyes widened behind her jeweled spectacles as she saw who had spokenharry she said beaming how lovely why dont you come and join i wouldnt come near you with a tenfoot broomstick said harry furiously what did you do that to hagrid for ehrita skeeter raised her heavily penciled eyebrowsour readers have a right to the truth harry i am merely doing mywho cares if hes halfgiant harry shouted theres nothing wrong with himthe whole pub had gone very quiet madam rosmerta was staring over from behind the bar apparently oblivious to the fact that the flagon she was filling with mead was overflowingrita skeeters smile flickered very slightly but she hitched it back almost at once she snapped open her crocodileskin handbag pulled out her quickquotes quill and said how about giving me an interview about the hagrid you know harry the man behind the muscles your unlikely friendship and the reasons behind it would you call him a father substitutehermione stood up very abruptly her butterbeer clutched in her hand as though it were a grenadeyou horrible woman she said through gritted teeth you dont care do you anything for a story and anyone will do wont they even ludo bagman sit down you silly little girl and dont talk about things you dont understand said rita skeeter coldly her eyes hardening as they fell on hermione i know things about ludo bagman that would make your hair curl not that it needs it she added eyeing hermiones bushy hairlets go said hermione cmon harry ron they left many people were staring at them as they went harry glanced back as they reached the door rita skeeters quickquotes quill was out it was zooming backward and forward over a piece of parchment on the tableshell be after you next hermione said ron in a low and worried voice as they walked quickly back up the streetlet her try said hermione defiantly she was shaking with rage ill show her silly little girl am i oh ill get her back for this first harry then hagrid you dont want to go upsetting rita skeeter said ron nervously im serious hermione shell dig up something on you my parents dont read the daily prophet she cant scare me into hiding said hermione now striding along so fast that it was all harry and ron could do to keep up with her the last time harry had seen hermione in a rage like this she had hit draco malfoy around the face and hagrid isnt hiding anymore he should never have let that excuse for a human being upset him come onbreaking into a run she led them all the way back up the road through the gates flanked by winged boars and up through the grounds to hagrids cabinthe curtains were still drawn and they could hear fang barking as they approachedhagrid hermione shouted pounding on his front door hagrid thats enough we know youre in there nobody cares if your mum was a giantess hagrid you cant let that foul skeeter woman do this to you hagrid get out here youre just being the door opened hermione said about t and then stopped very suddenly because she had found herself facetoface not with hagrid but with albus dumbledoregood afternoon he said pleasantly smiling down at themweerwe wanted to see hagrid said hermione in a rather small voiceyes i surmised as much said dumbledore his eyes twinkling why dont you come inoh um okay said hermioneshe ron and harry went into the cabin fang launched himself upon harry the moment he entered barking madly and trying to lick his ears harry fended off fang and looked aroundhagrid was sitting at his table where there were two large mugs of tea he looked a real mess his face was blotchy his eyes swollen and he had gone to the other extreme where his hair was concerned far from trying to make it behave it now looked like a wig of tangled wirehi hagrid said harryhagrid looked uplo he said in a very hoarse voicemore tea i think said dumbledore closing the door behind harry ron and hermione drawing out his wand and twiddling it a revolving tea tray appeared in midair along with a plate of cakes dumbledore magicked the tray onto the table and everybody sat down there was a slight pause and then dumbledore said did you by any chance hear what miss granger was shouting hagridhermione went slightly pink but dumbledore smiled at her and continued hermione harry and ron still seem to want to know you judging by the way they were attempting to break down the doorof course we still want to know you harry said staring at hagrid you dont think anything that skeeter cow sorry professor he added quickly looking at dumbledorei have gone temporarily deaf and havent any idea what you said

hoarsely not all of em wan me ter stayreally hagrid if you are holding out for universal popularity im afraid you will be in this cabin for a very long time said dumbledore now peering sternly over his halfmoon spectacles not a week has passed since i became headmaster of this school when i havent had at least one owl complaining about the way i run it but what should i do barricade myself in my study and refuse to talk to anybodyyeh yehre not halfgiant said hagrid croakilyhagrid look what ive got for relatives harry said furiously look at the dursleysan excellent point said professor dumbledore my own brother aberforth was prosecuted for practicing inappropriate charms on a goat it was all over the papers but did aberforth hide no he did not he held his head high and went about his business as usual of course im not entirely sure he can read so that may not have been bravery come back and teach hagrid said hermione quietly please come back we really miss youhagrid gulped more tears leaked out down his cheeks and into his tangled bearddumbledore stood up i refuse to accept your resignation hagrid and i expect you back at work on monday he said you will join me for breakfast at eightthirty in the great hall no excuses good afternoon to you alldumbledore left the cabin pausing only to scratch fangs ears when the door had shut behind him hagrid began to sob into his dustbinlidsized hands hermione kept patting his arm and at last hagrid looked up his eyes very red indeed and said great man dumbledore great man yeah he is said ron can i have one of these cakes hagrid help yerself said hagrid wiping his eyes on the back of his hand ar hes righ o course yehre all righ i bin stupid my ol dad woulda bin ashamed o the way ive bin behavin more tears leaked out but he wiped them away more forcefully and said never shown you a picture of my old dad have i herehagrid got up went over to his dresser opened a drawer and pulled out a picture of a short wizard with hagrids crinkled black eyes beaming as he sat on top of hagrids shoulder hagrid was a good seven or eight feet tall judging by the apple tree beside him but his face was beardless young round and smooth he looked hardly older than eleventha was taken jus after i got inter hogwarts hagrid croaked dad was dead chuffed thought i migh not be a wizard see cos me mum well anyway course i never was great shakes at magic really but at least he never saw me expelled died see in me second year dumbledore was the one who stuck up for me after dad went got me the gamekeeper job trusts people he does gives em second chances thas what sets him apar from other heads see hell accept anyone at hogwarts slong as theyve got the talent knows people can turn out okay even if their families weren well all tha respectable but some don understand that theres some whod always hold it against yeh theres some whod even pretend they just had big bones rather than stand up an say i am what i am an im not ashamed never be ashamed my ol dad used ter say theres some wholl hold it against you but theyre not worth botherin with an he was right ive bin an idiot im not botherin with her no more i promise yeh that big bones ill give her big bonesharry ron and hermione looked at one another nervously harry would rather have taken fifty blastended skrewts for a walk than admit to hagrid that he had overheard him talking to madame maxime but hagrid was still talking apparently unaware that he had said anything oddyeh know wha harry he said looking up from the photograph of his father his eyes very bright when i firs met you you reminded me o me a bit mum an dad gone an you was feelin like yeh wouldn fit in at hogwarts remember not sure yeh were really up to it an now look at yeh harry school championhe looked at harry for a moment and then said very seriously yeh know what id love harry id love yeh ter win i really would itd show em all yeh don have ter be pureblood ter do it yeh don have ter be ashamed of what yeh are itd show em dumbledores the one whos got it righ lettin anyone in as long as they can do magic how you doin with that egg harrygreat said harry really greathagrids miserable face broke into a wide watery smilethas my boy you show em harry you show em beat em alllying to hagrid wasnt quite like lying to anyone else harry went back to the castle later that afternoon with ron and hermione unable to banish the image of the happy expression on hagrids whiskery face as he had imagined harry winning the tournament the incomprehensible egg weighed more heavily than ever on harrys conscience that evening and by the time he had got into bed he had made up his mind it was time to shelve his pride and see if cedrics hint was worth anythingchapter twentyfive the egg and the eyeharry had no idea how long a bath he would need to work out the secret of the golden egg he decided to do it at night when he would be able to take as much time as he wanted reluctant though he was to accept more favors from cedric he also decided to use the prefects bathroom far fewer people were allowed in there so it was much less likely that he would be disturbedharry planned his excursion carefully because he had been caught out of bed and outofbounds by filch the caretaker in the middle of the night once before and had no desire to repeat the experience the invisibility cloak would of course be essential and as an added precaution harry thought he would take the marauders map which next to the cloak was the most useful aid to rulebreaking harry owned the map showed the whole of hogwarts including its many shortcuts and secret passageways and most important of all it revealed the people inside the castle as minuscule labeled dots moving around the corridors so that harry would be forewarned if somebody was approaching the bathroomon thursday night harry sneaked up to bed put on the cloak crept back downstairs and just as he had done on the night when hagrid had shown him the dragons waited for the portrait hole to open this time it was ron who waited outside to give the fat lady the password banana fritters good luck ron muttered climbing into the room as harry crept out past himit was awkward moving under the cloak tonight because harry had the heavy egg under one arm and the map held in front of his nose with the other however the moonlit corridors were empty and silent and by checking the map at strategic intervals harry was able to ensure that he wouldnt run into anyone he wanted to avoid when he reached the statue of boris the bewildered a lostlooking wizard with his gloves on the wrong hands he located the right door leaned close to it and muttered the password pine fresh just as cedric had told himthe door creaked open harry slipped inside bolted the door behind him and pulled off the invisibility cloak looking aroundhis immediate reaction was that it would be worth becoming a prefect just to be able to use this bathroom it was softly lit by a splendid candlefilled chandelier and everything was made of white marble including what looked like an empty rectangular swimming pool sunk into the middle of the floor about a hundred golden taps stood all around the pools edges each with a differently colored jewel set into its handle there was also a diving board long white linen curtains hung at the windows a large pile of fluffy white towels sat in a corner and there was a single goldenframed painting on the wall it featured a blonde mermaid whowas fast asleep on a rock her long hair over her face it fluttered every time she snoredharry moved forward looking around his footsteps echoing off the walls magnificent though the bathroom was and quite keen though he was to try out a few of those taps now he was here he couldnt quite suppress the feeling that cedric might have been having him on how on earth was this supposed to help solve the mystery of the egg nevertheless he put one of the huffy towels the cloak the map and the egg at the side of the swimmingpoolsized bath then knelt down and turned on a few of the tapshe could tell at once that they carried different sorts of bubble bath mixed with the water though it wasnt bubble bath as harry had ever experienced it one tap gushed pink and blue bubbles the size of footballs another poured icewhite foam so thick that harry thought it would have supported his weight if hed cared to test it a third sent heavily perfumed purple clouds hovering over the surface of the water harry amused himself for awhile turning the taps on and off particularly enjoying the effect of one whose jet bounced off the surface of the water in large arcs then when the deep pool was full of hot water foam and bubbles which took a very short time considering its size harry turned off all the taps pulled off his pajamas slippers and dressing gown and slid into the waterit was so deep that his feet barely touched the bottom and he actually did a couple of lengths before swimming back to the side and treading water staring at the egg highly enjoyable though it was to swim in hot and foamy water with clouds of differentcolored steam wafting all around him no stroke of brilliance came to him no sudden burst of understandingharry stretched out his arms lifted the egg in his wet hands and opened it the wailing screeching sound filled the bathroom echoing and reverberating off the marble walls but it sounded just as incomprehensible as ever if not more so with all the echoes he snapped it shut again worried that the sound would attract filch wondering whether that hadnt been cedrics plan and then making him jump so badly that he dropped the egg which clattered away across the bathroom floor someone spokeid try putting it in the water if i were youharry had swallowed a considerable amount of bubbles in shock he stood up sputtering and saw the ghost of a very glumlooking girl sitting crosslegged on top of one of the taps it was moaning myrtle who was usually to be heard sobbing in the sbend of a toilet three floors belowmyrtle harry said in outrage im im not wearing anythingthe foam was so dense that this hardly mattered but he had a nasty feeling that myrtle had been spying on him from out of one of the taps ever since he had arrivedi closed my eyes when you got in she said blinking at him through her thick spectacles you havent been to see me for agesyeah well said harry bending his knees slightly just to make absolutely sure myrtle couldnt see anything but his head im not supposed to come into your bathroom am i its a girls oneyou didnt used to care said myrtle miserably you used to be in there all the timethis was true though only because harry ron and hermione had found myrtles outoforder toilets a convenient place to brew polyjuice potion in secret a forbidden potion that had turned him and ron into living replicas of crabbe and goyle for an hour so that they could sneak into the slytherin common roomi got told off for going in there said harry which was halftrue percy had once caught him coming out of myrtles bathroom i thought id better not come back after thatoh i see said myrtle picking at a spot on her chin in a morose sort of way well anyway id try the egg in the water thats what cedric diggory didhave you been spying on him too said harry indignantly what dyou do sneak up here in the evenings to watch the prefects take bathssometimes said myrtle rather slyly but ive never come out to speak to anyone beforeim honored said harry darkly you keep your eyes shuthe made sure myrtle had her glasses well covered before hoisting himself out of the bath wrapping the towel firmly around his waist and going to retrieve the egg once he was back in the water myrtle peered through her fingers and said go on then open it under the waterharry lowered the egg beneath the foamy surface and opened it and this time it did not wail a gurgling song was coming out of it a song whose words he couldnt distinguish through the wateryou need to put your head under too said myrtle who seemed to be thoroughly enjoying bossing him around go onharry took a great breath and slid under the surface and now sitting on the marble bottom of the bubblefilled bath he heard a chorus of eerie voices singing to him from the open egg in his handscome seek us where our voices soundwe cannot sing above the groundand while you re searching ponder thiswove taken what youll sorely missan hour long youll have to lookand to recover what we tookbut past an hour the prospects blacktoo late its gone it wont come backharry let himself float back upward and broke the bubbly surface shaking his hair out of his eyeshear it said myrtleyeah come seek us where our voices sound and if i need persuading hang on i need to listen againhe sank back beneath the water it took three more underwater renditions of the eggs song before harry had it memorized then he trod water for a while thinking hard while myrtle sat and watched himive got to go and look for people who cant use their voices above the ground he said slowly er who could that beslow arent youhe had never seen moaning myrtle so cheerful apart from the day when a dose of polyjuice potion had given hermione the hairy face and tail of a cat harry stared around the bathroom thinking if the voices could only be heard underwater then it made sense for them to belong to underwater creatures he ran this theory past myrtle who smirked at himwell thats what diggory thought she said he lay there talking to himself for ages about it ages and ages nearly all the bubbles had gone underwater harry said slowly myrtle what lives in the lake apart from the giant squidoh all sorts she said i sometimes go down there sometimes dont have any choice if someone flushes my toilet when im not expecting ittrying not to think about moaning myrtle zooming down a pipe to the lake with the contents of a toilet harry said well does anything in there have a human voice hang on harrys eyes had fallen on the picture of the snoozing mermaid on the wallmyrtle there arent merpeople in there are thereoooh very good she said her thick glasses twinkling it took diggory much longer than that and that was with her awake too myrtle jerked her head toward the mermaid with an expression of great dislike on her glum face giggling and showing off and flashing her fins thats it isnt it said harry excitedly the second tasks to go and find the merpeople in the lake and and but he suddenly realized what he was saying and he felt the excitement drain out of him as though someone had just pulled a plug in his stomach he wasnt a very good swimmer hed never had much practice dudley had had lessons in his youth but aunt petunia and uncle vernon no doubt hoping that harry would drown one day hadnt bothered to give him any a couple of lengths of this bath were all very well but that lake was very large and very deep and merpeople would surely live right at the bottom myrtle harry said slowly how am i supposed to breatheat this myrtles eyes filled with sudden tears againtactless she muttered groping in her robes for a handkerchiefwhats tactless said harry bewilderedtalking about breathing in front of me she said shrilly and her voice echoed loudly around the bathroom when i cant when i havent not for ages she buried her face in her handkerchief and sniffed loudly harry remembered how touchy myrtle had always been about being dead but none of the other ghosts he knew made such a fuss about itsorry he said impatiently i didnt mean i just forgot oh yes very easy to forget myrtles dead said myrtle gulping looking at him out of swollen eyes nobody missed me even when i was alive took them hours and hours to find my body i know i was sitting there waiting for them olive hornby came into the bathroom are you in here again sulking myrtle she said because professor dippet asked me to look for you and then she saw my body ooooh she didnt forget it until her dying day i made sure of that followed her around and reminded her i did i remember at her brothers wedding but harry wasnt listening he was thinking about the merpeoples song again weve taken what you ii sorely miss that sounded as though they were going to steal something of his something he had to get back what were they going to takeand then of course she went to the ministry of magic to stop me stalking her so i had to come back here and live in my toiletgood said harry vaguely well im a lot further on than i was shut your eyes again will you im getting outhe retrieved the egg from the bottom of the bath climbed out dried himself and pulled on his pajamas and dressing gown againwill you come and visit me in my bathroom again sometime moaning myrtle asked mournfully as harry picked up the invisibility cloaker ill try harry said though privately thinking the only way hed be visiting myrtles bathroom again was if every other toilet in the castle got blocked see you myrtle thanks for your helpbye bye she said gloomily and as harry put on the invisibllity cloak he saw her zoom back up the tapout in the dark corridor harry examined the marauders map to check that the coast was still clear yes the dots belonging to filch and his cat mrs norris were safely in their office nothing else seemed to be moving apart from peeves though he was bouncing around the trophy room on the floor above harry had taken his first step back toward gryffindor tower when something else on the map caught his eye something distinctly oddpeeves was not the only thing that was moving a single dot was flitting around a room in the bottom lefthand corner snapes office but the dot wasnt labeled severus snape it was bartemius crouchharry stared at the dot mr crouch was supposed to be too ill to go to work or to come to the yule ball so what was he doing sneaking into hogwarts at one oclock in the morning harry watched closely as the dot moved around and around the room pausing here and there harry hesitated thinking and then his curiosity got the better of him he turned and set off in the opposite direction toward the nearest staircase he was going to see what crouch was up toharry walked down the stairs as quietly as possible though the faces in some of the portraits still turned curiously at the squeak of a floorboard the rustle of his pajamas he crept along the corridor below pushed aside a tapestry about halfway along and proceeded down a narrower staircase a shortcut that would take him down two floors he kept glancing down at the map wondering it just didnt seem in character somehow for correct lawabiding mr crouch to be sneaking around somebody elses office this late at nightand then halfway down the staircase not thinking about what he was doing not concentrating on anything but the peculiar behavior of mr crouch harrys leg suddenly sank right through the trick step neville always forgot to jump he gave an ungainly wobble and the golden egg still damp from the bath slipped from under his arm he lurched forward to try and catch it but too late the egg fell down the long staircase with a bang as loud as a bass drum on every step the invisibility cloak slipped harry snatched at it and the marauder s map fluttered out of his hand and slid down six stairs where sunk in the step to above his knee he couldnt reach itthe golden egg fell through the tapestry at the bottom of the staircase burst open and began wailing loudly in the corridor below harry pulled out his wand and struggled to touch the marauder s map to wipe it blank but it was too far away to reach pulling the cloak back over himself harry straightened up listening hard with his eyes screwed up with fear and almost immediately peevesit was the unmistakable hunting cry of filch the caretaker harry could hear his rapid shuffling footsteps coming nearer and nearer his wheezy voice raised in furywhats this racket wake up the whole castle will you ill have you peeves ill have you youll and what is thisfilchs footsteps halted there was a clink of metal on metal and the wailing stopped filch had picked up the egg and closed it harry stood very still one leg still jammed tightly in the magical step listening any moment now filch was going to pull aside the tapestry expecting to see peeves and there would be no peeves but if he came up the stairs he would spot the marauders map and invisibility cloak or not the map would show harry potter standing exactly where he wasegg filch said quietly at the foot of the stairs my sweet mrs norris was obviously with him this is a triwizard clue this belongs to a school championharry felt sick his heart was hammering very fast peeves filch roared gleefully youve been stealinghe ripped back the tapestry below and harry saw his horrible pouchy face and bulging pale eyes staring up the dark and to filch deserted staircasehiding are you he said softly im coming to get you peeves youve gone and stolen a triwizard clue peeves dumbledorell have you out of here for this you filthy pilfering poltergeist filch started to climb the stairs his scrawny dustcolored cat at his heels mrs morriss lamplike eyes so very like her masters were fixed directly upon harry he had had occasion before now to wonder whether the invisibility cloak worked on cats sick with apprehension he watched filch drawing nearer and nearer in his old flannel dressing gown he tried desperately to pull his trapped leg free but it merely sank a few more inches any second now filch was going to spot the map or walk right into him filch whats going onfilch stopped a few steps below harry and turned at the foot of the stairs stood the only person who could make harrys situation worse snape he was wearing a long gray nightshirt and he looked lividits peeves professor filch whispered malevolently he threw this egg down the stairssnape climbed up the stairs quickly and stopped beside filch harry gritted his teeth convinced his loudly thumping heart would give him away at any second peeves said snape softly staring at the egg in filchs hands but peeves couldnt get into my office this egg was in your office professorof course not snape snapped i heard banging and wailing yes professor that was the egg i was coming to investigate peeves threw it professor and when i passed my office i saw that the torches were lit and a cupboard door was ajar somebody has been searching itbut peeves couldnt i know he couldnt filch snape snapped again i seal my office with a spell none but a wizard could break snape looked up the stairs straight through harry and then down into the corridor below i want you to come and help me search for the intruder filchi yes professor but filch looked yearningly up the stairs right through harry who could see that he was very reluctant to forgo the chance of cornering peeves go harry pleaded with him silently go with snape go mrs norris was peering around filchs legs harry had the distinct impression that she could smell him why had he filled that bath with so much perfumed foamthe thing is professor said filch plaintively the headmaster will have to listen to me this time peeves has been stealing from a student it might be my chance to get him thrown out of the castle once and for all filch i dont give a damn about that wretched poltergeist its my office thats clunk clunk clunksnape stopped talking very abruptly he and filch both looked down at the foot of the stairs harry saw madeye moody limp into sight through the narrow gap between their heads moody was wearing his old traveling cloak over his nightshirt and leaning on his staff as usualpajama party is it he growled up the stairsprofessor snape and i heard noises professor said filch at once peeves the poltergeist throwing things around as usual and then professor snape discovered that someone had broken into his off shut up snape hissed to filchmoody took a step closer to the foot of the stairs harry saw moodys magical eye travel over snape and then unmistakably onto himselfharrys heart gave a horrible jolt moody could see through invisibility cloaks he alone could see the full strangeness of the scenesnape in his nightshirt filch clutching the egg and he harry trapped in the stairs behind them moodys lopsided gash of a mouth opened in surprise for a few seconds he and harry stared straight into each others eyes then moody closed his mouth and turned his blue eye upon snape again did i hear that correctly snape he asked slowly someone broke into your officeit is unimportant said snape coldly on the contrary growled moody it is very important whod want to break into your officea student i daresay said snape harry could see a vein flickering horribly on snapes greasy temple it has happened before potion ingredients have gone missing from my private store cupboard students attempting illicit mixtures no doubtreckon they were after potion ingredients eh said moody not hiding anything else in your office are youharry saw the edge of snapes sallow face turn a nasty brick color the vein in his temple pulsing more rapidlyyou know im hiding nothing moody he said in a soft and dangerous voice as youve searched my office pretty thoroughly yourselfmoodys face twisted into a smile aurors privilege snape dumbledore told me to keep an eye dumbledore happens to trust me said snape through clenched teeth i refuse to believe that he gave you orders to search my officecourse dumbledore trusts you growled moody hes a trusting man isnt he believes in second chances but me i say there are spots that dont come off snape spots that never come off dyou know what i meansnape suddenly did something very strange he seized his left forearm convulsively with his right hand as though something on it had hurt himmoody laughed get back to bed snapeyou dont have the authority to send me anywhere snape hissed letting go of his arm as though angry with himself i have as much right to prowl this school after dark as you doprowl away said moody but his voice was full of menace i look forward to meeting you in a dark corridor some time youve dropped something by the way with a stab of horror harry saw moody point at the marauders map still lying on the staircase six steps below him as snape and filch both turned to look at it harry threw caution to the winds he raised his arms under the cloak and waved furiously at moody to attract his attention mouthing its mine minesnape had reached out for it a horrible expression of dawning comprehension on his face accio parchmentthe map flew up into the air slipped through snapes outstretched fingers and soared down the stairs into moodys handmy mistake moody said calmly its mine mustve dropped it earlier but snapes black eyes were darting from the egg in filchs arms to the map in moodys hand and harry could tell he was putting two and two together as only snape could potter he said quietlywhats that said moody calmly folding up the map and pocketing itpotter snape snarled and he actually turned his head and stared right at the place where harry was as though he could suddenly see him that egg is potters egg that piece of parchment belongs to potter i have seen it before i recognize it potter is here potter in his invisibility cloaksnape stretched out his hands like a blind man and began to move up the stairs harry could have sworn his overlarge nostrils were dilating trying to sniff harry out trapped harry leaned backward trying to avoid snapes fingertips but any moment nowtheres nothing there snape barked moody but ill be happy to tell the headmaster how quickly your mind jumped to harry pottermeaning what snape turned again to look at moody his hands still outstretched inches from harrys chestmeaning that dumbledores very interested to know whos got it in for that boy said moody limping nearer still to the foot of the stairs and so am i snape very interested the torchlight flickered across his mangled face so that the scars and the chunk missing fromhis nose looked deeper and darker than eversnape was looking down at moody and harry couldnt see the expression on his face for a moment nobody moved or said anything then snape slowly lowered his handsi merely thought said snape in a voice of forced calm that if potter was wandering around after hours again its an unfortunate habit of his he should be stopped for for his own safetyah i see said moody softly got potters best interests at heart have youthere was a pause snape and moody were still staring at each other mrs norris gave a loud meow still peering around filchs legs looking for the source of harrys bubblebath smelli think i will go back to bed snape said curtlybest idea youve had all night said moody now filch if youll just give me that eggno said filch clutching the egg as though it were his firstborn son professor moody this is evidence of peeves treacheryits the property of the champion he stole it from said moody hand it over nowsnape swept downstairs and passed moody without another word filch made a chirruping noise to mrs norris who stared blankly at harry for a few more seconds before turning and following her master still breathing very fast harry heard snape walking away down the corridor filch handed moody the egg and disappeared from view too muttering to mrs norris never mind my sweet well see dumbledore in the morning tell him what peeves was up toa door slammed harry was left staring down at moody who placed his staff on the bottommost stair and started to climb laboriously toward him a dull clunk on every other stepclose shave potter he muttered yeah i er thanks said harry weaklywhat is this thing said moody drawing the marauders map out of his pocket and unfolding itmap of hogwarts said harry hoping moody was going to pull him out of the staircase soon his leg was really hurting himmerlins beard moody whispered staring at the map his magical eye going haywire this this is some map potteryeah its quite useful harry said his eyes were starting to water from the pain er professor moody dyou think you could help me what oh yes yes of course moody took hold of harrys arms and pulled harrys leg came free of the trick step and he climbed onto the one above it moody was still gazing at the mappotter he said slowly you didnt happen by any chance to see who broke into snapes office did you on this map i meaner yeah i did harry admitted it was mr crouchmoodys magical eye whizzed over the entire surface of the map he looked suddenly alarmedcrouch he said youre youre sure potterpositive said harrywell hes not here anymore said moody his eye still whizzing over the map crouch thats very very interesting he said nothing for almost a minute still staring at the map harry could tell that this news meant something to moody and very much wanted to know what it was he wondered whether he dared ask moody scared him slightly yet moody had just helped him avoid an awful lot of trouble er professor moody why dyou reckon mr crouch wanted to look around snapes officemoodys magical eye left the map and fixed quivering upon harry it was a penetrating glare and harry had the impression that moody was sizing him up wondering whether to answer or not or how much to tell himput it this way potter moody muttered finally they say old madeyes obsessed with catching dark wizards but im nothing nothing compared to barty crouchhe continued to stare at the map harry was burning to know moreprofessor moody he said again dyou think could this have anything to do with maybe mr crouch thinks theres something going on like what said moody sharplyharry wondered how much he dare say he didnt want moody to guess that he had a source of information outside hogwarts that might lead to tricky questions about siriusi dont know harry muttered odd stuffs been happening lately hasnt it its been in the daily prophet the dark mark at the world cup and the death eaters and everythingboth of moodys mismatched eyes widenedyoure a sharp boy potter he said his magical eye roved back to the marauders map crouch could be thinking along those lines he said slowly very possible there have been some funny rumors flying around lately helped along by rita skeeter of course its making a lot of people nervous i reckon a grim smile twisted his lopsided mouth oh if theres one thing i hate he muttered more to himself than to harry and his magical eye was fixed on the lefthand corner of the map its a death eater who walked free harry stared at him could moody possibly mean what harry thought he meantand now i want to ask you a question potter said moody in a more businesslike toneharrys heart sank he had thought this was coming moody was going to ask where he had got this map which was a very dubious magical object and the story of how it had fallen into his hands incriminated not only him but his own father fred and george weasley and professor lupin their last defense against the dark arts teacher moody waved the map in front of harry who braced himselfcan i borrow thisoh said harryhe was very fond of his map but on the other hand he was extremely relieved that moody wasnt asking where hed got it and there was no doubt that he owed moody a favoryeah okaygood boy growled moody i can make good use of this this might be exactly what ive been looking for right bed potter come on now they climbed to the top of the stairs together moody still examining the map as though it was a treasure the like of which he had never seen before they walked in silence to the door of moodys office where he stopped and looked up at harryyou ever thought of a career as an auror potterno said harry taken abackyou want to consider it said moody nodding and looking at harry thoughtfully yes indeed and incidentally im guessing you werent just taking that egg for a walk tonighter no said harry grinning ive been working out the cluemoody winked at him his magical eye going haywire again nothing like a nighttime stroll to give you ideas potter see you in the morninghe went back into his office staring down at the marauders map again and closed the door behind himharry walked slowly back to gryffindor tower lost in thought about snape and crouch and what it all meant why was crouch pretending to be ill if he could manage to get to hogwarts when he wanted to what did he think snape was concealing in his officeand moody thought he harry ought to be an auror interesting idea but somehow harry thought as he got quietly into his fourposter ten minutes later the egg and the cloak now safely back in his trunk he thought hed like to check how scarred the rest of them were before he chose it as a careerchapter twentysix the second taskyou said youd already worked out that egg clue said hermione indignantlykeep your voice down said harry crossly i just need to sort of finetune it all righthe ron and hermione were sitting at the very back of the charms class with a table to themselves they were supposed to be practicing the opposite of the summoning charm today the banishing charm owing to the potential for nasty accidents when objects kept flying across the room professor flitwick had given each student a stack of cushions on which to practice the theory being that these wouldnt hurt anyone if they went off target it was a good theory but it wasnt working very well nevilles aim was so poor that he kept accidentally sending much heavier things flying across the room professor flitwick for instancejust forget the egg for a minute all right harry hissed as professor flitwick went whizzing resignedly past them landing on top of a large cabinet im trying to tell you about snape and moody this class was an ideal cover for a private conversation as everyone was having far too much fun to pay them any attention harry had been recounting his adventures of the previous night in whispered installments for the last half hoursnape said moodys searched his office as well ron whispered his eyes alight with interest as he banished a cushion with a sweep of his wand it soared into the air and knocked parvatis hat off what dyou reckon moodys here to keep an eye on snape as well as karkaroffwell i dunno if thats what dumbledore asked him to do but hes definitely doing it said harry waving his wand without paying much attention so that his cushion did an odd sort of belly flop off the desk moody said dumbledore only lets snape stay here because hes giving him a second chance or something what said ron his eyes widening his next cushion spinning high into the air ricocheting off the chandelier and dropping heavily onto flitwicks desk harry maybe moody thinks snape put your name in the goblet of fireoh ron said hermione shaking her head sceptically we thought snape was trying to kill harry before and it turned out he was saving harrys life remembershe banished a cushion and it flew across the room and landed in the box they were all supposed to be aiming at harry looked at hermione thinking it was true that snape had saved his life once but the odd thing was snape definitely loathed him just as hed loathed harry s father when they had been at school together snape loved taking points from harry and had certainly never missed an opportunity to give him punishments or even to suggest that he should be suspended from the schooli dont care what moody says hermione went on dumbledores not stupid he was right to trust hagrid and professor lupin even though loads of people wouldnt have given them jobs so why shouldnt he be right about snape even if snape is a bit evil said ron promptly come on hermione why are all these dark wizard catchers searching his office thenwhy has mr crouch been pretending to be ill said hermione ignoring ron its a bit funny isnt it that he cant manage to come to the yule ball but he can get up here in the middle of the night when he wants toyou just dont like crouch because of that elf winky said ron sending a cushion soaring into the windowyou just want to think snapes up to something said hermione sending her cushion zooming neatly into the boxi just want to know what snape did with his first chance if hes on his second one said harry grimly and his cushion to his very great surprise flew straight across the room and landed neatly on top of hermionesobedient to siriuss wish of hearing about anything odd at hogwarts harry sent him a letter by brown owl that night explaining all about mr crouch breaking into snape s office and moody and snapes conversation then harry turned his attention in earnest to the most urgent problem facing him how to survive underwater for an hour on the twentyfourth of februaryron quite liked the idea of using the summoning charm again harry had explained about aqualungs and ron couldnt see why harry shouldnt summon one from the nearest muggle town hermione squashed this plan by pointing out that in the unlikely event that harry managed to learn how to operate an aqualung within the set limit of an hour he was sure to be disqualified for breaking the international code of wizarding secrecy it was too much to hope that no muggles would spot an aqualung zooming across the countryside to hogwartsof course the ideal solution would be for you to transfigure yourself into a submarine or something hermione said if only wed done human transfiguration already but i dont think we start that until sixth year and it can go badly wrong if you dont know what youre doingyeah i dont fancy walking around with a periscope sticking out of my head said harry i spose i could always attack someone in front of moody he might do it for mei dont think hed let you choose what you wanted to be turned into though said hermione seriously no i think your best chance is some sort of charmso harry thinking that he would soon have had enough of the library to last him a lifetime buried himself once more among the dusty volumes looking for any spell that might enable a human to survive without oxygen however though he ron and hermione searched through their lunchtimes evenings and whole weekends though harry asked professor mcgonagall for a note of permission to use the restricted section and even asked the irritable vulturelike librarian madam pince for help they found nothing whatsoever that would enable harry to spend an hour underwater and live to tell the talefamiliar flutterings of panic were starting to disturb harry now and he was finding it difficult to concentrate in class again the lake which harry had always taken for granted as just another feature of the grounds drew his eyes whenever he was near a classroom window a great irongray mass of chilly water whose dark and icy depths were starting to seem as distant as the moonjust as it had before he faced the horntail time was slipping away as though somebody had bewitched the clocks to go extrafast there was a week to go before february the twentyfourth there was still time there were five days to go he was bound to find something soon three days to go please let me find something please with two days left harry started to go off food again the only good thing about breakfast on monday was the return of the brown owl he had sent to sirius he pulled off the parchment unrolled it and saw the shortest letter sirius had ever written to himsend date of next hogsmeade weekend by return owlharry turned the parchment over and looked at the back hoping to see something else but it was blankweekend after next whispered hermione who had read the note over harrys shoulder here take my quill and send this owl back straight awayharry scribbled the dates down on the back of siriuss letter tied it onto the brown owls leg and watched it take flight again what had he expected advice on how to survive underwater he had been so intent on telling sirius all about snape and moody he had completely forgotten to mention the eggs cluewhats he want to know about the next hogsmeade weekend for said rondunno said harry dully the momentary happiness that had flared inside him at the sight of the owl had died come on care of magical creatureswhether hagrid was trying to make up for the blastended skrewts or because there were now only two skrewts left or because he was trying to prove he could do anything that professor grubblyplank could harry didnt know but hagrid had been continuing her lessons on unicorns ever since hed returned to work it turned out that hagrid knew quite as much about unicorns as he did about monsters though it was clear that he found their lack of poisonous fangs disappointingtoday he had managed to capture two unicorn foals unlike fullgrown unicorns they were pure gold parvati and lavender went into transports of delight at the sight of them and even pansy parkinson had to work hard to conceal how much she liked themeasier ter spot than the adults hagrid told the class they turn silver when theyre abou two years old an they grow horns at aroun four don go pure white till theyre full grown round about seven theyre a bit more trustin when theyre babies don mind boys so much cmon move in a bit yeh can pat em if yeh want give em a few o these sugar lumps you okay harry hagrid muttered moving aside slightly while most of the others swarmed around the baby unicornsyeah said harry jus nervous eh said hagridbit said harry harry said hagrid clapping a massive hand on his shoulder so that harrys knees buckled under its weight idve bin worried before i saw yeh take on tha horntail but i know now yeh can do anythin yeh set yer mind ter im not worried at all yehre goin ter be fine got yer clue worked out haven yehharry nodded but even as he did so an insane urge to confess that he didnt have any idea how to survive at the bottom of the lake for an hour came over him he looked up at hagrid perhaps he had to go into the lake sometimes to deal with the creatures in it he looked after everything else on the grounds after allyehre goin ter win hagrid growled patting harrys shoulder again so that harry actually felt himself sink a couple of inches into the soft ground i know it i can feel it yehre goin ter win harry nharry just couldnt bring himself to wipe the happy confident smile off hagrids face pretending he was interested in the young unicorns he forced a smile in return and moved forward to pat them with the othersby the evening before the second task harry felt as though he were trapped in a nightmare he was fully aware that even if by some miracle he managed to find a suitable spell hed have a real job mastering it overnight how could he have let this happen why hadnt he got to work on the eggs clue sooner why had he ever let his mind wander in class what if a teacher had once mentioned how to breathe underwaterhe sat with hermione and ron in the library as the sun set outside tearing feverishly through page after page of spells hidden from one another by the massive piles of books on the desk in front of each of them harry s heart gave a huge leap every time he saw the word water on a page but more often than not it was merely take two pints of water half a pound of shredded mandrake leaves and a newti dont reckon it can be done said rons voice flatly from the other side of the table theres nothing nothing closest was that thing to dry up puddles and ponds that drought charm but that was nowhere near powerful enough to drain the lakethere must be something hermione muttered moving a candle closer to her her eyes were so tired she was poring over the tiny print of olde and forgotten bewitchments and charmes with her nose about an inch from the page theyd never have set a task that was undoablethey have said ron harry just go down to the lake tomorrow right stick your head in yell at the merpeople to give back whatever theyve nicked and see if they chuck it out best you can do matetheres a way of doing it hermione said crossly there just has to beshe seemed to be taking the librarys lack of useful information on the subject as a personal insult it had never failed her beforei know what i should have done said harry resting facedown on saucy tricks for tricky sorts i shouldve learned to be an animagus like siriusan animagus was a wizard who could transform into an animalyeah you couldve turned into a goldfish any time you wanted said ronor a frog yawned harry he was exhausted it takes years to become an animagus and then you have to register yourself and everything said hermione vaguely now squinting down the index of weird wizarding dilemmas and their solutions professor mcgonagall told us remember youve got to register yourself with the improper use of magic office what animal you become and your markings so you cant abuse ithermione i was joking said harry wearily i know i havent got a chance of turning into a frog by tomorrow morningoh this is no use hermione said snapping shut weird wizarding dilemmas who on earth wants to make their nose hair grow into ringletsi wouldnt mind said fred weasleys voice be a talking point wouldnt itharry ron and hermione looked up fred and george had just emerged from behind some bookshelveswhatre you two doing here ron askedlooking for you said george mcgonagall wants you ron and you hermionewhy said hermione looking surpriseddunno she was looking a bit grim though said fredwere supposed to take you down to her office said georgeron and hermione stared at harry who felt his stomach drop was professor mcgonagall about to tell ron and hermione off perhaps shed noticed how much they were helping him when he ought to be working out how to do the task alonewell meet you back in the common room hermione told harry as she got up to go with ron both of them looked very anxious bring as many of these books as you can okayright said harry uneasilyby eight oclock madam pince had extinguished all the lamps and came to chivvy harry out of the library staggering under the weight of as many books as he could carry harry returned to the gryffindor common room pulled a table into a corner and continued to search there was nothing in madcap magic for wacky warlocks nothing in a guide to medieval sorcery not one mention of underwater exploits in an anthology of eighteenthcentury charms or in dreadful denizens of the deep or powers you never knew you had and what to do with them now youve wised upcrookshanks crawled into harrys lap and curled up purring deeply the common room emptied slowly around harry people kept wishing him luck for the next morning in cheery confident voices like hagrid s all of them apparently convinced that he was about to pull off another stunning performance like the one he had managed in the first task harry couldnt answer them he just nodded feeling as though there were a golfball stuck in his throat by ten to midnight he was alone in the room with crookshanks he had searched all the remaining books and ron and hermione had not come backits over he told himself you cant do it youll just have to go down to the lake in the morning and tell the judgeshe imagined himself explaining that he couldnt do the task he pictured bagmans look of roundeyed surprise karkaroffs satisfied yellowtoothed smile he could almost hear fleur delacour saying i knew it e is too young e is only a little boy he saw malfoy flashing his potter stinks badge at the front of the crowd saw hagrid s crestfallen disbelieving face forgetting that crookshanks was on his lap harry stood up very suddenly crookshanks hissed angrily as he landed on the floor gave harry a disgusted look and stalked away with his bottlebrush tail in the air but harry was already hurrying up the spiral staircase to his dormitory he would grab the invisibility cloak and go back to the library hed stay there all night if he had to lumos harry whispered fifteen minutes later as he opened the library doorwand tip alight he crept along the bookshelves pulling down more books books of hexes and charms books on merpeople and water monsters books on famous witches and wizards on magical inventions on anything at all that might include one passing reference to underwater survival he carried them over to a table then set to work searching them by the narrow beam of his wand occasionally checking his watch one in the morning two in the morning the only way he could keep going was to tell himself over and over again next book in the next one the next one the mermaid in the painting in the prefects bathroom was laughing harry was bobbing like a cork in bubbly water next to her rock while she held his firebolt over his headcome and get it she giggled maliciously come on jumpi cant harry panted snatching at the firebolt and struggling not to sink give it to mebut she just poked him painfully in the side with the end of the broomstick laughing at himthat hurts get off ouch harry potter must wake up sirstop poking me dobby must poke harry potter sir he must wake upharry opened his eyes he was still in the library the invisibility cloak had slipped off his head as hed slept and the side of his face was stuck to the pages of where theres a wand theres a way he sat up straightening his glasses blinking in the bright daylightharry potter needs to hurry squeaked dobby the second task starts in ten minutes and harry potter ten minutes harry croaked ten ten minuteshe looked down at his watch dobby was right it was twenty past nine a large dead weight seemed to fall through harrys chest into his stomachhurry harry potter squeaked dobby plucking at harrys sleeve you is supposed to be down by the lake with the other champions sirits too late dobby harry said

dobby heard professor mcgonagall and professor moody in the staffroom talking about the next task dobby cannot let harry potter lose his wheezyharrys doubts vanished jumping to his feet he pulled off the invisibility cloak stuffed it into his bag grabbed the gillyweed and put it into his pocket then tore out of the library with dobby at his heelsdobby is supposed to be in the kitchens sir dobby squealed as they burst into the corridor dobby will be missed good luck harry potter sir good lucksee you later dobby harry shouted and he sprinted along the corridor and down the stairs three at a timethe entrance hall contained a few lastminute stragglers all leaving the great hall after breakfast and heading through the double oak doors to watch the second task they stared as harry flashed past sending colin and dennis creevey flying as he leapt down the stone steps and out onto the bright chilly groundsas he pounded down the lawn he saw that the seats that had encircled the dragons enclosure in november were now ranged along the opposite bank rising in stands that were packed to the bursting point and reflected in the lake below the excited babble of the crowd echoed strangely across the water as harry ran flatout around the other side of the lake toward the judges who were sitting at another golddraped table at the waters edge cedric fleur and krum were beside the judges table watching harry sprint toward themim here harry panted skidding to a halt in the mud and accidentally splattering fleurs robeswhere have you been said a bossy disapproving voice the tasks about to startharry looked around percy weasley was sitting at the judges table mr crouch had failed to turn up againnow now percy said ludo bagman who was looking intensely relieved to see harry let him catch his breathdumbledore smiled at harry but karkaroff and madame maxime didnt look at all pleased to see him it was obvious from the looks on their faces that they had thought he wasnt going to turn upharry bent over hands on his knees gasping for breath he had a stitch in his side that felt as though he had a knife between his ribs but there was no time to get rid of it ludo bagman was now moving among the champions spacing them along the bank at intervals of ten feet harry was on the very end of the line next to krum who was wearing swimming trunks and was holding his wand readyall right harry bagman whispered as he moved harry a few feet farther away from krum know what youre going to doyeah harry panted massaging his ribsbagman gave harrys shoulder a quick squeeze and returned to the judges table he pointed his wand at his throat as he had done at the world cup said sonorus and his voice boomed out across the dark water toward the standswell all our champions are ready for the second task which will start on my whistle they have precisely an hour to recover what has been taken from them on the count of three then one two threethe whistle echoed shrilly in the cold still air the stands erupted with cheers and applause without looking to see what the other champions were doing harry pulled off his shoes and socks pulled the handful of gillyweed out of his pocket stuffed it into his mouth and waded out into the lakeit was so cold he felt the skin on his legs searing as though this were fire not icy water his sodden robes weighed him down as he walked in deeper now the water was over his knees and his rapidly numbing feet were slipping over silt and flat slimy stones he was chewing the gillyweed as hard and fast as he could it felt unpleasantly slimy and rubbery like octopus tentacles waistdeep in the freezing water he stopped swallowed and waited for something to happenhe could hear laughter in the crowd and knew he must look stupid walking into the lake without showing any sign of magical power the part of him that was still dry was covered in goose pimples half immersed in the icy water a cruel breeze lifting his hair harry started to shiver violently he avoided looking at the stands the laughter was becoming louder and there were catcalls and jeering from the slytherins then quite suddenly harry felt as though an invisible pillow had been pressed over his mouth and nose he tried to draw breath but it made his head spin his lungs were empty and he suddenly felt a piercing pain on either side of his neck harry clapped his hands around his throat and felt two large slits just below his ears flapping in the cold air he had gills without pausing to think he did the only thing that made sense he flung himself forward into the waterthe first gulp of icy lake water felt like the breath of life his head had stopped spinning he took another great gulp of water and felt it pass smoothly through his gills sending oxygen back to his brain he stretched out his hands in front of him and stared at them they looked green and ghostly under the water and they had become webbed he twisted around and looked at his bare feet they had become elongated and the toes were webbed tooit looked as though he had sprouted flippersthe water didnt feel icy anymore either on the contrary he felt pleasantly cool and very light harry struck out once more marveling at how far and fast his flipperlike feet propelled him through the vater and noticing how clearly he could see and how he no longer seemed to need to blink he had soon swum so far into the lake that he could no longer see the bottom he flipped over and dived into its depthssilence pressed upon his ears as he soared over a strange dark foggy landscape he could only see ten feet around him so that as he sped throuugh the water new scenes seemed to loom suddenly out of the incoming darkness forests of rippling tangled black weed wide plains of mud littered with dull glimmering stones he swam deeper and deeper out toward the middle of the lake his eyes wide staring through the eerily graylit water around him to the shadow beyond where the water became opaquesmall fish flickered past him like silver darts once or twice he thought he saw something larger moving ahead of him but when he got nearer he discovered it to be nothing but a large blackened log or a dense clump of weed there was no sign of any of the other champions merpeople ron nor thankfully the giant squidlight green weed stretched ahead of him as far as he could see two feet deep like a meadow of very overgrown grass harry was staring unblinkingly ahead of him trying to discern shapes through the gloom and then without warning something grabbed hold of his ankleharry twisted his body around and saw a grindylow a small horned water demon poking out of the weed its long fingers clutched tightly around harrys leg its pointed fangs bared harry stuck his webbed hand quickly inside his robes and fumbled for his wand by the time he had grasped it two more grindylows had risen out of the weed had seized handfuls of harrys robes and were attempting to drag him downrelashio harry shouted except that no sound came out a large bubble issued from his mouth and his wand instead of sending sparks at the grindylows pelted them with what seemed to be a jet of boiling water for where it struck them angry red patches appeared on their green skin harry pulled his ankle out of the grindylows grip and swam as fast as he could occasionally sending more jets of hot water over his shoulder at random every now and then he felt one of the grindylows snatch at his foot again and he kicked out hard finally he felt his foot connect with a horned skull and looking back saw the dazed grindylow floating away crosseyed while its fellows shook their fists at harry and sank back into the weedharry slowed down a little slipped his wand back inside his robes and looked around listening again he turned full circle in the water the silence pressing harder than ever against his eardrums he knew he must be even deeper in the lake now but nothing was moving but the rippling weedhow are you getting onharry thought he was having a heart attack he whipped around and saw moaning myrtle floating hazily in front of him gazing at him through her thick pearly glassesmyrtle harry tried to shout but once again nothing came out of his mouth but a very large bubble moaning myrtle actually giggledyou want to try over there she said pointing i wont come with you i dont like them much they always chase me when i get too close harry gave her the thumbsup to show his thanks and set off once more careful to swim a bit higher over the weed to avoid any more grindylows that might be lurking therehe swam on for what felt like at least twenty minutes he was passing over vast expanses of black mud now which swirled murkily as he disturbed the water then at long last he heard a snatch of haunting mersongan hour long youll have to look and to recover what we tookharry swam faster and soon saw a large rock emerge out of the muddy water ahead it had paintings of merpeople on it they were carrying spears and chasing what looked like the giant squid harry swam on past the rock following the mersongyour times half gone so tarry not lest what you seek stays here to rot a cluster of crude stone dwellings stained with algae loomed suddenly out of the gloom on all sides here and there at the dark windows harry saw faces faces that bore no resemblance at all to the painting of the mermaid in the prefects bathroom the merpeople had grayish skin and long wild dark green hair their eyes were yellow as were their broken teeth and they wore thick ropes of pebbles around their necks they leered at harry as he swam past one or two of them emerged from their caves to watch him better their powerful silver fish tails beating the water spears clutched in their handsharry sped on staring around and soon the dwellings became more numerous there were gardens of weed around some of them and he even saw a pet grindylow tied to a stake outside one door merpeople were emerging on all sides now watching him eagerly pointing at his webbed hands and gills talking behind their hands to one another harry sped around a corner and a very strange sight met his eyesa whole crowd of merpeople was floating in front of the houses that lined what looked like a merversion of a village square a choir of merpeople was singing in the middle calling the champions toward them and behind them rose a crude sort of statue a gigantic merperson hewn from a boulder four people were bound tightly to the tail of the stone merpersonron was tied between hermione and cho chang there was also a girl who looked no older than eight whose clouds of silvery hair made harry feel sure that she was fleur delacours sister all four of them appeared to be in a very deep sleep their heads were lolling onto their shoulders and fine streams of bubbles kept issuing from their mouthsharry sped toward the hostages half expecting the merpeople to lower their spears and charge at him but they did nothing the ropes of weed tying the hostages to the statue were thick slimy and very strong for a fleeting second he thought of the knife sirius had bought him for christmas locked in his trunk in the castle a quarter of a mile away no use to him whatsoeverhe looked around many of the merpeople surrounding them were carrying spears he swam swiftly toward a sevenfoottall merman with a long green beard and a choker of shark fangs and tried to mime a request to borrow the spear the merman laughed and shook his headwe do not help he said in a harsh croaky voicecome on harry said fiercely but only bubbles issued from his mouth and he tried to pull the spear away from the merman but the merman yanked it back still shaking his head and laughingharry swirled around staring about something sharp anything there were rocks littering the lake bottom he dived and snatched up a particularly jagged one and returned to the statue he began to hack at the ropes binding ron and after several minutes hard work they broke apart ron floated unconscious a few inches above the lake bottom drifting a little in the ebb of the waterharry looked around there was no sign of any of the other champions what were they playing at why didnt they hurry up he turned back to hermione raised the jagged rock and began to hack at her bindings too at once several pairs of strong gray hands seized him half a dozen mermen were pulling him away from hermione shaking their greenhaired heads and laughingyou take your own hostage one of them said to him leave the others no way said harry furiously but only two large bubbles came outyour task is to retrieve your own friend leave the others shes my friend too harry yelled gesturing toward hermione an enormous silver bubble emerging soundlessly from his lips and i dont want them to die eitherchos head was on hermiones shoulder the small silverhaired girl was ghostly green and pale harry struggled to fight off the mermen but they laughed harder than ever holding him back harry looked wildly around where were the other champions would he have time to take ron to the surface and come back down for hermione and the others would he be able to find them again he looked down at his watch to see how much time was left it had stopped workingbut then the merpeople around him pointed excitedly over his head harry looked up and saw cedric swimming toward them there was an enormous bubble around his head which made his features look oddly wide and stretchedgot lost he mouthed looking panicstricken fleur and krumre coming nowfeeling enormously relieved harry watched cedric pull a knife out of his pocket and cut cho free he pulled her upward and out of sightharry looked around waiting where were fleur and krum time was getting short and according to the song the hostages would be lost after an hour the merpeople started screeching animatedly those holding harry loosened their grip staring behind them harry turned and saw something monstrous cutting through the water toward them a human body in swimming trunks with the head of a shark it was krum he appeared to have transfigured himself but badlythe sharkman swam straight to hermione and began snapping and biting at her ropes the trouble was that krums new teeth were positioned very awkwardly for biting anything smaller than a dolphin and harry was quite sure that if krum wasnt careful he was going to rip hermione in half darting forward harry hit krum hard on the shoulder and held up the jagged stone krum seized it and began to cut hermione free within seconds he had done it he grabbed hermione around the waist and without a backward glance began to rise rapidly with her toward the surfacenow what harry thought desperately if he could be sure that fleur was coming but still no sign there was nothing to be done except he snatched up the stone which krum had dropped but the mermen now closed in around ron and the little girl shaking their heads at him harry pulled out his wandget out of the wayonly bubbles flew out of his mouth but he had the distinct impression that the mermen had understood him because they suddenly stopped laughing their yellowish eyes were fixed upon harrys wand and they looked scared there might be a lot more of them than there were of him but harry could tell by the looks on their faces that they knew no more magic than the giant squid didyouve got until three harry shouted a great stream of bubbles burst from him but he held up three fingers to make sure they got the message one he put down a finger two he put down a second one they scattered harry darted forward and began to hack at the ropes binding the small girl to the statue and at last she was free he seized the little girl around the waist grabbed the neck of rons robes and kicked off from the bottomit was very slow work he could no longer use his webbed hands to propel himself forward he worked his flippers furiously but ron and fleurs sister were like potatofilled sacks dragging him back down he fixed his eyes skyward though he knew he must still be very deep the water above him was so dark merpeople were rising with him he could see them swirling around him with ease watching him struggle through the water would they pull him back down to the depths when the time was up did they perhaps eat humans harrys legs were seizing up with the effort to keep swimming his shoulders were aching horribly with the effort of dragging ron and the girlhe was drawing breath with extreme difficulty he could feel pain on the sides of his neck again he was becoming very aware of how wet the water was in his mouth yet the darkness was definitely thinning now he could see daylight above him he kicked hard with his flippers and discovered that they were nothing more than feetwater was flooding through his mouth into his lungs he was starting to feel dizzy but he knew light and air were only ten feet above him he had to get there he had to harry kicked his legs so hard and fast it felt as though his muscles were screaming in protest his very brain felt waterlogged he couldnt breathe he needed oxygen he had to keep going he could not stop and then he felt his head break the surface of the lake wonderful cold clear air was making his wet face sting he gulped it down feeling as though he had never breathed properly before and panting pulled ron and the little girl up with him all around him wild greenhaired heads were emerging out of the water with him but they were smiling at himthe crowd in the stands was making a great deal of noise shouting and screaming they all seemed to be on their feet harry had the impression they thought that ron and the little girl might be dead but they were wrong both of them had opened their eyes the girl looked scared and confused but ron merely expelled a great spout of water blinked in the bright light turned to harry and said wet this isnt it then he spotted fleurs sister what did you bring her forfleur didnt turn up i couldnt leave her harry pantedharry you prat said ron you didnt take that song thing seriously did you dumbledore wouldnt have let any of us drownthe song said it was only to make sure you got back inside the time limit said ron i hope you didnt waste time down there acting the heroharry felt both stupid and annoyed it was all very well for ron hed been asleep he hadnt felt how eerie it was down in the lake surrounded by spearcarrying merpeople whod looked more than capable of murdercmon harry said shortly help me with her i dont think she can swim very wellthey pulled fleurs sister through the water back toward the bank where the judges stood watching twenty merpeople accompanying them like a guard of honor singing their horrible screechy songsharry could see madam pomfrey fussing over hermione krum cedric and cho all of whom were wrapped in thick blanketsdumbledore and ludo bagman stood beaming at harry and ron from the bank as they swam nearer but percy who looked very white and somehow much younger than usual came splashing out to meet them meanwhile madame maxime was trying to restrain fleur delacour who was quite hysterical fighting tooth and nail to return to the watergabrielle gabrielle is she alive is she urtshes fine harry tried to tell her but he was so exhausted he could hardly talk let alone shoutpercy seized ron and was dragging him back to the bank gerroff percy im all right dumbledore and bagman were pulling harry upright fleur had broken free of madame maxime and was hugging her sisterit was ze grindylows zey attacked me oh gabrielle i thought i thought come here you said madam pomfrey she seized harry and pulled him over to hermione and the others wrapped him so tightly in a blanket that he felt as though he were in a straitjacket and forced a measure of very hot potion down his throat steam gushed out of his earsharry well done hermione cried you did it you found out how all by yourselfwell said harry he would have told her about dobby but he had just noticed karkaroff watching him he was the only judge who had not left the table the only judge not showing signs of pleasure and relief that harry ron and fleurs sister had got back safely yeah thats right said harry raising his voice slightly so that karkaroff could hear himyou haff a water beetle in your hair hermownninny said krum harry had the impression that krum was drawing her attention back onto himself perhaps to remind her that he had just rescued her from the lake but hermione brushed away the beetle impatiently and said youre well outside the time limit though harry did it take you ages to find usno i found you okayharrys feeling of stupidity was growing now he was out of the water it seemed perfectly clear that dumbledores safety precautions wouldnt have permitted the death of a hostage just because their champion hadnt turned up why hadnt he just grabbed ron and gone he would have been first back cedric and krum hadnt wasted time worrying about anyone else they hadnt taken the mersong seriously dumbledore was crouching at the waters edge deep in conversation with what seemed to be the chief merperson a particularly wild and ferociouslooking female he was making the same sort of screechy noises that the merpeople made when they were above water clearly dumbledore could speak mermish finally he straightened up turned to his fellow judges and said a conference before we give the marks i thinkthe judges went into a huddle madam pomfrey had gone to rescue ron from percys clutches she led him over to harry and the others gave him a blanket and some pepperup potion then went to fetch fleur and her sister fleur had many cuts on her face and arms and her robes were torn but she didnt seem to care nor would she allow madam pomfrey to clean themlook after gabrielle she told her and then she turned to harry you saved er she said breathlessly even though she was not your ostageyeah said harry who was now heartily wishing hed left all three girls tied to the statuefleur bent down kissed harry twice on each cheek he felt his face burn and wouldnt have been surprised if steam was coming out of his ears again then said to ron and you tooyou elped yeah said ron looking extremely hopeful yeah a bit fleur swooped down on him too and kissed him hermione looked simply furious but just then ludo bagmans magically magnified voice boomed out beside them making them all jump and causing the crowd in the stands to go very quietladies and gentlemen we have reached our decision merchieftainess murcus has told us exactly what happened at the bottom of the lake and we have therefore decided to award marks out of fifty for each of the champions as follows fleur delacour though she demonstrated excellent use of the bubblehead charm was attacked by grindylows as she approached her goal and failed to retrieve her hostage we award her twentyfive pointsapplause from the standsi deserved zero said fleur throatily shaking her magnificent headcedric diggory who also used the bubblehead charm was first to return with his hostage though he returned one minute outside the time limit of an hour enormous cheers from the hufflepuffs in the crowd harry saw cho give cedric a glowing look we therefore award him fortyseven pointsharrys heart sank if cedric had been outside the time limit he most certainly had beenviktor krum used an incomplete form of transfiguration which was nevertheless effective and was second to return with his hostage we award him forty pointskarkaroff clapped particularly hard looking very superiorharry potter used gillyweed to great effect bagman continued he returned last and well outside the time limit of an hour however the merchieftainess informs us that mr potter was first to reach the hostages and that the delay in his return was due to his determination to return all hostages to safety not merely his ownron and hermione both gave harry halfexasperated halfcommiserating looksmost of the judges and here bagman gave karkaroff a very nasty look feel that this shows moral fiber and merits full marks however mr potters score is fortyfive pointsharrys stomach leapt he was now tying for first place with cedric ron and hermione caught by surprise stared at harry then laughed and started applauding hard with the rest of the crowdthere you go harry ron shouted over the noise you werent being thick after all you were showing moral fiberfleur was clapping very hard too but krum didnt look happy at all he attempted to engage hermione in conversation again but she was too busy cheering harry to listenthe third and final task will take place at dusk on the twentyfourth of june continued bagman the champions will be notified of what is coming precisely one month beforehand thank you all for your support of the championsit was over harry thought dazedly as madam pomfrey began herding the champions and hostages back to the castle to get into dry clothes it was over he had got through he didnt have to worry about anything now until june the twentyfourth next time he was in hogsmeade harry decided as he walked back up the stone steps into the castle he was going to buy dobby a pair of socks for every day of the yearchapter twentyseven padfoot returnsone of the best things about the aftermath of the second task was that everybody was very keen to hear details of what had happened down in the lake which meant that ron was getting to share harrys limelight for once harry noticed that rons version of events changed subtly with every retelling at first he gave what seemed to be the truth it tallied with hermiones story anyway dumbledore had put all the hostages into a bewitched sleep in professor mcgonagalls office first assuring them that they would be quite safe and would awake when they were back above the water one week later however ron was telling a thrilling tale of kidnap in which he struggled singlehandedly against fifty heavily armed merpeople who had to beat him into submission before tying him upbut i had my wand hidden up my sleeve he assured padma patil who seemed to be a lot keener on ron now that he was getting so much attention and was making a point of talking to him every time they passed in the corridors i couldve taken those meridiots any time i wantedwhat were you going to do snore at them said hermione waspishly people had been teasing her so much about being the thing that viktor krum would most miss that she was in a rather tetchy moodrons ears went red and thereafter he reverted to the bewitched sleep version of eventsas they entered march the weather became drier but cruel winds skinned their hands and faces every time they went out onto the grounds there were delays in the post because the owls kept being blown off course the brown owl that harry had sent to sirius with the dates of the hogsmeade weekend turned up at breakfast on friday morning with half its feathers sticking up the wrong way harry had no sooner torn off siriuss reply than it took flight clearly afraid it was going to be sent outside againsiriuss letter was almost as short as the previous onebe at stile at end of road out of hogsmeade past dervish and banges at two oclock on saturday afternoon bring as much food as you canhe hasnt come back to hogsmeade said ron incredulously it looks like it doesnt it said hermione i cant believe him said harry tensely if hes caught made it so far though hasnt he said ron and its not like the place is swarming with dementors anymoreharry folded up the letter thinking if he was honest with himself he really wanted to see sirius again he therefore approached the final lesson of the afternoon double potions feeling considerably more cheerful than he usually did when descending the steps to the dungeonsmalfoy crabbe and goyle were standing in a huddle outside the classroom door with pansy parkinsons gang of slytherin girls all of them were looking at something harry couldnt see and sniggering heartily pansys puglike face peered excitedly around goyles broad back as harry ron and hermione approachedthere they are there they are she giggled and the knot of slytherins broke apart harry saw that pansy had a magazine in her hands witch weekly the moving picture on the front showed a curlyhaired witch who was smiling toothily and pointing at a large sponge cake with her wandyou might find something to interest you in there granger pansy said loudly and she threw the magazine at hermione who caught it looking startled at that moment the dungeon door opened and snape beckoned them all insidehermione harry and ron headed for a table at the back of the dungeon as usual once snape had turned his back on them to write up the ingredients of todays potion on the blackboard hermione hastily rifled through the magazine under the desk at last in the center pages hermione found what they were looking for harry and ron leaned in closer a color photograph of harry headed a short piece entitledharry potters secret heartachea boy like no other perhaps yet a boy suffering all the usual pangs of adolescence writes rita skeeter deprived of love since the tragic demiseof his parents fourteenyearold harry potter thought he had found solace in his steady girlfriend at hogwarts muggleborn hermione granger little did he know that he would shortly be suffering yet another emotional blow in a life already littered with personal lossmiss granger a plain but ambitious girl seems to have a taste for famous wizards that harry alone cannot satisfy since the arrival at hogwarts of viktor krum bulgarian seeker and hero of the last world quidditch cup miss granger has been toying with both boys affections krum who is openly smitten with the devious miss granger has already invited her to visit him in bulgaria over the summer holidays and insists that he has never felt this way about any other girlhowever it might not be miss grangers doubtful natural charms that have captured these unfortunate boys interestshes really ugly says pansy parkinson a pretty and vivacious fourthyear student but shed be well up to making a love potion shes quite brainy i think thats how shes doing itlove potions are of course banned at hogwarts and no doubt albus dumbledore will want to investigate these claims in the meantime harry potters wellwishers must hope that next time he bestows his heart on a worthier candidatei told you ron hissed at hermione as she stared down at the article i told you not to annoy rita skeeter shes made you out to be some sort of of scarlet womanhermione stopped looking astonished and snorted with laughter scarlet woman she repeated shaking with suppressed giggles as she looked around at ronits what my mum calls them ron muttered his ears going redif thats the best rita can do shes losing her touch said hermione still giggling as she threw witch weekly onto the empty chair beside her what a pile of old rubbishshe looked over at the slytherins who were all watching her and harry closely across the room to see if they had been upset by the article hermione gave them a sarcastic smile and a wave and she harry and ron started unpacking the ingredients they would need for their witsharpening potiontheres something funny though said hermione ten minutes later holding her pestle suspended over a bowl of scarab beetles how could rita skeeter have known known what said ron quickly you havent been mixing up love potions have youdont be stupid hermione snapped starting to pound up her beetles again no its just how did she know viktor asked me to visit him over the summerhermione blushed scarlet as she said this and determinedly avoided rons eyeswhat said ron dropping his pestle with a loud clunkhe asked me right after hed pulled me out of the lakehermione muttered after hed got rid of his sharks head madam pomfrey gave us both blankets and then he sort of pulled me away from the judges so they wouldnt hear and he said if i wasnt doing anything over the summer would i like to and what did you say said ron who had picked up his pestle and was grinding it on the desk a good six inches from his bowl because he was looking at hermioneand he did say hed never felt the same way about anyone else hermione went on going so red now that harry could almost feel the heat coming from her but how could rita skeeter have heard him she wasnt there or was she maybe she has got an invisibility cloak maybe she sneaked onto the grounds to watch the second task and what did you say ron repeated pounding his pestle down so hard that it dented the deskwell i was too busy seeing whether you and harry were okay tofascinating though your social life undoubtedly is miss granger said an icy voice right behind them and all three of them jumped i must ask you not to discuss it in my class ten points from gryffindorsnape had glided over to their desk while they were talking the whole class was now looking around at them malfoy took the opportunity to flash potter stinks across the dungeon at harryah reading magazines under the table as well snape added snatching up the copy of witch weekly a further ten points from gryffindor oh but of course snapes black eyes glittered as they fell on rita skeeters article potter has to keep up with his press cuttings the dungeon rang with the slytherins laughter and an unpleasant smile curled snapes thin mouth to harrys fury he began to read the article aloudharry potters secret heartache dear dear potter whats ailing you now a boy like no other perhaps harry could feel his face burning snape was pausing at the end of every sentence to allow the slytherins a hearty laugh the article sounded ten times worse when read by snape even hermione was blushing scarlet nowharry potters wellwishers must hope that next time he bestows his heart upon a worthier candidate how very touching sneered snape rolling up the magazine to continued gales of laughter from the slytherins well i think i had better separate the three of you so you can keep your minds on your potions rather than on your tangled love lives weasley you stay here miss granger over there beside miss parkinson potter that table in front of my desk move nowfurious harry threw his ingredients and his bag into his cauldron and dragged it up to the front of the dungeon to the empty table snape followed sat down at his desk and watched harry unload his cauldron determined not to look at snape harry resumed the mashing of his scarab beetles imagining each one to have snapes faceall this press attention seems to have inflated your already overlarge head potter said snape quietly once the rest of the class had settled down againharry didnt answer he knew snape was trying to provoke him he had done this before no doubt he was hoping for an excuse to take a round fifty points from gryffindor before the end of the classyou might be laboring under the delusion that the entire wizarding world is impressed with you snape went on so quietly that no one else could hear him harry continued to pound his scarab beetles even though he had already reduced them to a very fine powder but i dont care how many times your picture appears in the papers to me potter you are nothing but a nasty little boy who considers rules to be beneath himharry tipped the powdered beetles into his cauldron and started cutting up his ginger roots his hands were shaking slightly out of anger but he kept his eyes down as though he couldnt hear what snape was saying to himso i give you fair warning potter snape continued in a sorter and more dangerous voice pintsized celebrity or not if i catch you breaking into my office one more time i havent been anywhere near your office said harry angrily forgetting his feigned deafnessdont lie to me snape hissed his fathomless black eyes boring into harrys boomslang skin gillyweed both come from my private stores and i know who stole themharry stared back at snape determined not to blink or to look guilty in truth he hadnt stolen either of these things from snape hermione had taken the boomslang skin back in their second year they had needed it for the polyjuice potion and while snape had suspected harry at the time he had never been able to prove it dobby of course had stolen the gillyweedi dont know what youre talking about harry lied coldlyyou were out of bed on the night my office was broken into snape hissed i know it potter now madeye moody might have joined your fan club but i will not tolerate your behavior one more nighttime stroll into my office potter and you will payright said harry coolly turning back to his ginger roots ill bear that in mind if i ever get the urge to go in theresnapes eyes flashed he plunged a hand into the inside of his black robes for one wild moment harry thought snape was about to pull out his wand and curse him then he saw that snape had drawn out a small crystal bottle of a completely clear potion harry stared at itdo you know what this is potter snape said his eyes glittering dangerously againno said harry with complete honesty this timeit is veritaserum a truth potion so powerful that three drops would have you spilling your innermost secrets for this entire class to hear said snape viciously now the use of this potion is controlled by very strict ministry guidelines but unless you watch your step you might just find that my hand slips he shook the crystal bottle slightly right over your evening pumpkin juice and then potter then well find out whether youve been in my office or notharry said nothing he turned back to his ginger roots once more picked up his knife and started slicing them again he didnt like the sound of that truth potion at all nor would he put it past snape to slip him some he repressed a shudder at the thought of what might come spilling out of his mouth if snape did it quite apart from landing a whole lot of people in trouble hermione and dobby for a start there were all the other things he was concealing like the fact that he was in contact with sirius and his insides squirmed at the thought how he felt about cho he tipped his ginger roots into the cauldron too and wondered whether he ought to take a leaf out of moody s book and start drinking only from a private hip flaskthere was a knock on the dungeon doorenter said snape in his usual voicethe class looked around as the door opened professor karkaroff came in everyone watched him as he walked up toward snapes desk he was twisting his finger around his goatee and looking agitatedwe need to talk said karkaroff abruptly when he had reached snape he seemed so determined that nobody should hear what he was saying that he was barely opening his lips it was as though he were a rather poor ventriloquist harry kept his eyes on his ginger roots listening hardill talk to you after my lesson karkaroff snape muttered but karkaroff interrupted himi want to talk now while you cant slip off severus youve been avoiding meafter the lesson snape snappedunder the pretext of holding up a measuring cup to see if hed poured out enough armadillo bile harry sneaked a sidelong glance at the pair of them karkaroff looked extremely worried and snape looked angrykarkaroff hovered behind snapes desk for the rest of the double period he seemed intent on preventing snape from slipping away at the end of class keen to hear what karkaroff wanted to say harry deliberately knocked over his bottle of armadillo bile with two minutes to go to the bell which gave him an excuse to duck down behind his cauldron and mop up while the rest of the class moved noisily toward the doorwhats so urgent he heard snape hiss at karkaroffthis said karkaroff and harry peering around the edge of his cauldron saw karkaroff pull up the lefthand sleeve of his robe and show snape something on his inner forearmwell said karkaroff still making every effort not to move his lips do you see its never been this clear never since put it away snarled snape his black eyes sweeping the classroombut you must have noticed karkaroff began in an agitated voicewe can talk later karkaroff spat snape potter what are you doingclearing up my armadillo bile professor said harry innocently straightening up and showing snape the sodden rag he was holdingkarkaroff turned on his heel and strode out of the dungeon he looked both worried and angry not wanting to remain alone with an exceptionally angry snape harry threw his books and ingredients back into his bag and left at top speed to tell ron and hermione what he had just witnessedthey left the castle at noon the next day to find a weak silver sun shining down upon the grounds the weather was milder than it had been all year and by the time they arrived in hogsmeade all three of them had taken off their cloaks and thrown them over their shoulders the food sirius had told them to bring was in harrys bag they had sneaked a dozen chicken legs a loaf of bread and a flask of pumpkin juice from the lunch tablethey went into gladrags wizardwear to buy a present for dobby where they had fun selecting the most lurid socks they could find including a pair patterned with flashing gold and silver stars and another that screamed loudly when they became too smelly then at half past one they made their way up the high street past dervish and banges and out toward the edge of the villageharry had never been in this direction before the winding lane was leading them out into the wild countryside around hogsmeade the cottages were fewer here and their gardens larger they were walking toward the foot of the mountain in whose shadow hogsmeade lay then they turned a corner and saw a stile at the end of the lane waiting for them its front paws on the topmost bar was a very large shaggy black dog which was carrying some newspapers in its mouth and looking very familiar hello sirius said harry when they had reached himthe black dog sniffed harrys bag eagerly wagged its tail once then turned and began to trot away from them across the scrubby patch of ground that rose to meet the rocky foot of the mountain harry ron and hermione climbed over the stile and followedsirius led them to the very foot of the mountain where the ground was covered with boulders and rocks it was easy for him with his four paws but harry ron and hermione were soon out of breath they followed sirius higher up onto the mountain itself for nearly half an hour they climbed a steep winding and stony path following siriuss wagging tail sweating in the sun the shoulder straps of harrys bag cutting into his shouldersthen at last sirius slipped out of sight and when they reached the place where he had vanished they saw a narrow fissure in the rock they squeezed into it and found themselves in a cool dimly lit cave tethered at the end of it one end of his rope around a large rock was buckbeak the hippogriff half gray horse half giant eagle buckbeaks fierce orange eye flashed at the sight of them all three of them bowed low to him and after regarding them imperiously for a moment buckbeak bent his scaly front knees and allowed hermione to rush forward and stroke his feathery neck harry however was looking at the black dog which had just turned into his godfathersirius was wearing ragged gray robes the same ones he had been wearing when he had left azkaban his black hair was longer than it had been when he had appeared in the fire and it was untidy and matted once more he looked very thinchicken he said hoarsely after removing the old daily prophets from his mouth and throwing them down onto the cave floorharry pulled open his bag and handed over the bundle of chicken legs and breadthanks said sirius opening it grabbing a drumstick sitting down on the cave floor and tearing off a large chunk with his teeth ive been living off rats mostly cant steal too much food from hogsmeade id draw attention to myselfhe grinned up at harry but harry returned the grin only reluctantlywhatre you doing here sirius he saidfulfilling my duty as godfather said sirius gnawing on the chicken bone in a very doglike way dont worry about it im pretending to be a lovable strayhe was still grinning but seeing the anxiety in harrys face said more seriously i want to be on the spot your last letter well lets just say things are getting fishier ive been stealing the paper every time someone throws one out and by the looks of things im not the only one whos getting worriedhe nodded at the yellowing daily prophets on the cave floor and ron picked them up and unfolded them harry however continued to stare at siriuswhat if they catch you what if youre seenyou three and dumbledore are the only ones around here who know im an animagus said sirius shrugging and continuing to devour the chicken legron nudged harry and passed him the daily prophets there were two the first bore the headline mystery illness ofbartemius crouch the second ministry witch still missingminister of magic now personally involvedharry scanned the story about crouch phrases jumped out at him hasnt been seen in public since november house appears deserted st mungos hospital for magical maladies and injuries decline comment ministry refuses to confirm rumors of critical illness theyre making it sound like hes dying said harry slowly but he cant be that ill if he managed to get up here my brothers crouchs personal assistant ron informed sirius he says crouch is suffering from overworkmind you he did look ill last time i saw him up close said harry slowly still reading the story the night my name came out of the goblet getting his comeuppance for sacking winky isnt he said hermione an edge to her voice she was stroking buckbeak who was crunching up siriuss chicken bones i bet he wishes he hadnt done it now bet he feels the difference now shes not there to look after himhermiones obsessed with houseelfs ron muttered to sirius casting hermione a dark look sirius however looked interestedcrouch sacked his houseelfyeah at the quidditch world cup said harry and he launched into the story of the dark marks appearance and winky being found with harrys wand clutched in her hand and mr crouchs fury when harry had finished sirius was on his feet again and had started pacing up and down the cavelet me get this straight he said after a while brandishing a fresh chicken leg you first saw the elfin the top box she was saving crouch a seat rightright said harry ron and hermione togetherbut crouch didnt turn up for the matchno said harry i think he said hed been too busysirius paced all around the cave in silence then he said harry did you check your pockets for your wand after youd left the top boxerm harry thought hard no he said finally i didnt need to use it before we got in the forest and then i put my hand in my pocket and all that was in there were my omnioculars he stared at sirius are you saying whoever conjured the mark stole my wand in the top boxits possible said siriuswinky didnt steal that wand hermione insistedthe elf wasnt the only one in that box said sirius his brow furrowed as he continued to pace who else was sitting behind youloads of people said harry some bulgarian ministers cornelius fudge the malfoys the malfoys said ron suddenly so loudly that his voice echoed all around the cave and buckbeak tossed his head nervously i bet it was lucius malfoyanyone else said siriusno one said harryyes there was there was ludo bagman hermione reminded himoh yeah i dont know anything about bagman except that he used to be beater for the wimbourne wasps said sirius still pacing whats he likehes okay said harry he keeps offering to help me with the triwizard tournamentdoes he now said sirius frowning more deeply i wonder why hed do thatsays hes taken a liking to me said harryhmm said sirius looking thoughtfulwe saw him in the forest just before the dark mark appeared hermione told sirius remember she said to harry and ronyeah but he didnt stay in the forest did he said ron the moment we told him about the riot he went off to the campsitehow dyou know hermione shot back how dyou know where he disapparated tocome off it said ron incredulously are you saying you reckon ludo bagman conjured the dark markits more likely he did it than winky said hermione stubbornlytold you said ron looking meaningfully at sirius told you shes obsessed with house but sirius held up a hand to silence ronwhen the dark mark had been conjured and the elf had been discovered holding harrys wand what did crouch dowent to look in the bushes said harry but there wasnt anyone else thereof course sirius muttered pacing up and down of course hed want to pin it on anyone but his own elf and then he sacked heryes said hermione in a heated voice he sacked her just because she hadnt stayed in her tent and let herself get trampled hermione will you give it a rest with the elf said ronsirius shook his head and said shes got the measure of crouch better than you have ron if you want to know what a mans like take a good look at how he treats his inferiors not his equalshe ran a hand over his unshaven face evidently thinking hardall these absences of barty crouchs he goes to the trouble of making sure his houseelf saves him a seat at the quidditch world cup but doesnt bother to turn up and watch he works very hard to reinstate the triwizard tournament and then stops coming to that too its not like crouch if hes ever taken a day off work because of illness before this ill eat buckbeakdyou know crouch then said harrysiriuss face darkened he suddenly looked as menacing as he had the night when harry first met him the night when harry still believed sirius to be a murdereroh i know crouch all right he said quietly he was the one who gave the order for me to be sent to azkaban without a trialwhat said ron and hermione togetheryoure kidding said harryno im not said sirius taking another great bite of chicken crouch used to be head of the department of magical law enforcement didnt you knowharry ron and hermione shook their headshe was tipped for the next minister of magic said sirius hes a great wizard barty crouch powerfully magical and powerhungry oh never a voldemort supporter he said reading the look on harrys face no barty crouch was always very outspoken against the dark side but then a lot of people who were against the dark side well you wouldnt understand youre too young thats what my dad said at the world cup said ron with a trace of irritation in his voice try us why dont youa grin flashed across siriuss thin faceall right ill try you he walked once up the cave back again and then said imagine that voldemorts powerful now you dont know who his supporters are you dont know whos working for him and who isnt you know he can control people so that they do terrible things without being able to stop themselves youre scared for yourself and your family and your friends every week news comes of more deaths more disappearances more torturing the ministry of magics in disarray they dont know what to do theyre trying to keep everything hidden from the muggles but meanwhile muggles are dying too terror everywhere panic confusion thats how it used to bewell times like that bring out the best in some people and the worst in others crouchs principles mightve been good in the beginning i wouldnt know he rose quickly through the ministry and he started ordering very harsh measures against voldemorts supporters the aurors were given new powers powers to kill rather than capture for instance and i wasnt the only one who was handed straight to the dementors without trial crouch fought violence with violence and authorized the use of the unforgivable curses against suspects i would say he became as ruthless and cruel as many on the dark side he had his supporters mind you plenty of people thought he was going about things the right way and there were a lot of witches and wizards clamoring for him to take over as minister of magic when voldemort disappeared it looked like only a matter of time until crouch got the top job but then something rather unfortunate happened sirius smiled grimly crouchs own son was caught with a group of death eaters whod managed to talk their way out of azkaban apparently they were trying to find voldemort and return him to powercrouchs son was caught gasped hermioneyep said sirius throwing his chicken bone to buckbeak flinging himself back down on the ground beside the loaf of bread and tearing it in half nasty little shock for old barty id imagine should have spent a bit more time at home with his family shouldnt he ought to have left the office early once in a while gotten to know his own sonhe began to wolf down large pieces of bread was his son a death eater said harryno idea said sirius still stuffing down bread i was in azkaban myself when he was brought in this is mostly stuff ive found out since i got out the boy was definitely caught in the company of people id bet my life were death eaters but he might have been in the wrong place at the wrong time just like the houseelf did crouch try and get his son off hermione whispered sirius let out a laugh that was much more like a bark crouch let his son off i thought you had the measure of him hermione anything that threatened to tarnish his reputation had to go he had dedicated his whole life to becoming minister of magic you saw him dismiss a devoted houseelf because she associated him with the dark mark again doesnt that tell you what hes like crouchs fatherly affection stretched just far enough to give his son a trial and by all accounts it wasnt much more than an excuse for crouch to show how much he hated the boy then he sent him straight to azkabanhe gave his own son to the dementors asked harry quietly thats right said sirius and he didnt look remotely amused now i saw the dementors bringing him in watched them through the bars in my cell door he cant have been more than nineteen they took him into a cell near mine he was screaming for his mother by nightfall he went quiet after a few days though they all went quiet in the end except when they shrieked in their sleep for a moment the deadened look in siriuss eyes became more pronounced than ever as though shutters had closed behind themso hes still in azkaban harry saidno said sirius dully no hes not in there anymore he died about a year after they brought him inhe diedhe wasnt the only one said sirius bitterly most go mad in there and plenty stop eating in the end they lose the will to live you could always tell when a death was coming because the dementors could sense it they got excited that boy looked pretty sickly when he arrived crouch being an important ministry member he and his wife were allowed a deathbed visit that was the last time i saw barty crouch half carrying his wife past my cell she died herself apparently shortly afterward grief wasted away just like the boy crouch never came for his sons body the dementors buried him outside the fortress i watched them do itsirius threw aside the bread he had just lifted to his mouth and instead picked up the flask of pumpkin juice and drained itso old crouch lost it all just when he thought he had it made he continued wiping his mouth with the back of his hand one moment a hero poised to become minister of magicnext his son dead his wife dead the family name dishonored and so ive heard since i escaped a big drop in popularity once the boy had died people started feeling a bit more sympathetic toward the son and started asking how a nice young lad from a good family had gone so badly astray the conclusion was that his father never cared much for him so cornelius fudge got the top job and crouch was shunted sideways into the department of international magical cooperationthere was a long silence harry was thinking of the way crouchs eyes had bulged as hed looked down at his disobedient houseelf back in the wood at the quidditch world cup this then must have been why crouch had overreacted to winky being found beneath the dark mark it had brought back memories of his son and the old scandal and his fall from grace at the ministrymoody says crouch is obsessed with catching dark wizards harry told siriusyeah ive heard its become a bit of a mania with him said sirius nodding if you ask me he still thinks he can bring back the old popularity by catching one more death eaterand he sneaked up here to search snapes office s aid ron triumphantly looking at hermioneyes and that doesnt make sense at all said siriusyeah it does said ron excitedly but sirius shook his headlisten if crouch wants to investigate snape why hasnt he been coming to judge the tournament it would be an ideal excuse to make regular visits to hogwarts and keep an eye on himso you think snape could be up to something then asked harry but hermione broke inlook i dont care what you say dumbledore trusts snape oh give it a rest hermione said ron impatiently i know dumbledores brilliant and everything but that doesnt mean a really clever dark wizard couldnt fool him why did snape save harrys life in the first year then why didnt he just let him diei dunno maybe he thought dumbledore would kick him outwhat dyou think sirius harry said loudly and ron and hermione stopped bickering to listeni think theyve both got a point said sirius looking thoughtfully at ron and hermione ever since i found out snape was teaching here ive wondered why dumbledore hired him snapes always been fascinated by the dark arts he was famous for it at school slimy oily greasyhaired kid he was sirius added and harry and ron grinned at each other snape knew more curses when he arrived at school than half the kids in seventh year and he was part of a gang of slytherins who nearly all turned out to be death eaterssirius held up his fingers and began ticking off namesrosier and wilkes they were both killed by aurors the year before voldemort fell the lestranges theyre a married couple theyre in azkaban avery from what ive heard he wormed his way out of trouble by saying hed been acting under the imperius curse hes still at large but as far as i know snape was never even accused of being a death eater not that that means much plenty of them were never caught and snape s certainly clever and cunning enough to keep himself out of troublesnape knows karkaroff pretty well but he wants to keep that quiet said ronyeah you shouldve seen snapes face when karkaroff turned up in potions yesterday said harry quickly karkaroff wanted to talk to snape he says snapes been avoiding him karkaroff looked really worried he showed snape something on his arm but i couldnt see what it washe showed snape something on his arm said sirius looking frankly bewildered he ran his fingers distractedly through his filthy hair then shrugged again well ive no idea what thats about but if karkaroff s genuinely worried and hes going to snape for answers sirius stared at the cave wall then made a grimace of frustrationtheres still the fact that dumbledore trusts snape and i know dumbledore trusts where a lot of other people wouldnt but i just cant see him letting snape teach at hogwarts if hed ever worked for voldemortwhy are moody and crouch so keen to get into snapes office then said ron stubbornlywell said sirius slowly i wouldnt put it past madeye to have searched every single teachers office when he got to hogwarts he takes his defense against the dark arts seriously moody im not sure he trusts anyone at all and after the things hes seen its not surprising ill say this for moody though he never killed if he could help it always brought people in alive where possible he was tough but he never descended to the level of the death eaters crouch though hes a different matter is he really ill if he is why did he make the effort to drag himself up to snapes office and if hes not whats he up to what was he doing at the world cup that was so important he didnt turn up in the top box whats he been doing while he should have been judging the tournamentsirius lapsed into silence still staring at the cave wall buckbeak was ferreting around on the rocky floor looking for bones he might have overlooked finally sirius looked up at ronyou say your brother s crouchs personal assistant any chance you could ask him if hes seen crouch latelyi can try said ron doubtfully better not make it sound like i reckon crouch is up to anything dodgy though percy loves crouchand you might try and find out whether theyve got any leads on bertha jorkins while youre at it said sirius gesturing to the second copy of the daily prophetbagman told me they hadnt said harryyes hes quoted in the article in there said sirius nodding at the paper blustering on about how bad berthas memory is well maybe shes changed since i knew her but the bertha i knew wasnt forgetful at all quite the reverse she was a bit dim but she had an excellent memory for gossip it used to get her into a lot of trouble she never knew when to keep her mouth shut i can see her being a bit of a liability at the ministry of magic maybe thats why bagman didnt bother to look for her for so long sirius heaved an enormous sigh and rubbed his shadowed eyeswhats the timeharry checked his watch then remembered it hadnt been working since it had spent over an hour in the lakeits half past three said hermioneyoud better get back to school sirius said getting to his feet now listen he looked particularly hard at harry i dont want you lot sneaking out of school to see me all right just send notes to me here i still want to hear about anything odd but youre not to go leaving hogwarts without permission it would be an ideal opportunity for someone to attack youno ones tried to attack me so far except a dragon and a couple of grindylows harry said but sirius scowled at himi dont care ill breathe freely again when this tournaments over and thats not until june and dont forget if youre talking about me among yourselves call me snuffles okayhe handed harry the empty napkin and flask and went to pat buckbeak goodbye ill walk to the edge of the village with you said sirius see if i can scrounge another paperhe transformed into the great black dog before they left the cave and they walked back down the mountainside with him across the boulderstrewn ground and back to the stile here he allowed each of them to pat him on the head before turning and setting off at a run around the outskirts of the village harry ron and hermione made their way back into hogsmeade and up toward hogwartswonder if percy knows all that stuff about crouch ron said as they walked up the drive to the castle but maybe he doesnt care itd probably just make him admire crouch even more yeah percy loves rules hed just say crouch was refusing to break them for his own sonpercy would never throw any of his family to the dementors said hermione severelyi dont know said ron if he thought we were standing in the way of his career percys really ambitious you know they walked up the stone steps into the entrance hall where the delicious smells of dinner wafted toward them from the great hallpoor old snuffles said ron breathing deeply he must really like you harry imagine having to live off ratschapter twentyeight the madness of mr crouchharry ron and hermione went up to the owlery after breakfast on sunday to send a letter to percy asking as sirius had suggested whether he had seen mr crouch lately they used hedwig because it had been so long since shed had a job when they had watched her fly out of sight through the owlery window they proceeded down to the kitchen to give dobby his new socksthe houseelves gave them a very cheery welcome bowing and curtsying and bustling around making tea again dobby was ecstatic about his presentharry potter is too good to dobby he squeaked wiping large tears out of his enormous eyesyou saved my life with that gillyweed dobby you really did said harryno chance of more of those eclairs is there said ron who was looking around at the beaming and bowing houseelvesyouve just had breakfast said hermione irritably but a great silver platter of eclairs was already zooming toward them supported by four elveswe should get some stuff to send up to snuffles harry mutteredgood idea said ron give pig something to do you couldnt give us a bit of extra food could you he said to the surrounding elves and they bowed delightedly and hurried off to get some moredobby wheres winky said hermione who was looking aroundwinky is over there by the fire miss said dobby quietly his ears drooping slightlyoh dear said hermione as she spotted winkyharry looked over at the fireplace too winky was sitting on the same stool as last time but she had allowed herself to become so filthy that she was not immediately distinguishable from the smokeblackened brick behind her her clothes were ragged and unwashed she was clutching a bottle of butterbeer and swaying slightly on her stool staring into the fire as they watched her she gave an enormous hiccupwinky is getting through six bottles a day now dobby whispered to harrywell its not strong that stuff harry saidbut dobby shook his head tis strong for a houseelf sir he saidwinky hiccuped again the elves who had brought the eclairs gave her disapproving looks as they returned to workwinky is pining harry potter dobby whispered sadly winky wants to go home winky still thinks mr crouch is her master sir and nothing dobby says will persuade her that professor dumbledore is her master nowhey winky said harry struck by a sudden inspiration walking over to her and bending down you dont know what mr crouch might be up to do you because hes stopped turning up to judge the triwizard tournamentwinkys eyes flickered her enormous pupils focused on harry she swayed slightly again and then said m master is stopped hic comingyeah said harry we havent seen him since the first task the daily prophets saying hes illwinky swayed some more staring blurrily at harrymaster hic illher bottom lip began to tremblebut were not sure if thats true said hermione quicklymaster is needing his hie winky whimpered the elf master cannot hic manage hic all by himself other people manage to do their own housework you know winky hermione said severelywinky hic is not only hic doing housework for mr crouch winky squeaked indignantly swaying worse than ever and slopping butterbeer down her already heavily stained blouse master is hic trusting winky with hic the most important hic the most secretwhat said harrybut winky shook her head very hard spilling more butterbeer down herselfwinky keeps hic her masters secrets she said mutinously swaying very heavily now frowning up at harry with

hic private and secret hic winky is a good houseelf hic winky keeps her silence hic people trying to hic pry and poke hic winkys eyelids drooped and suddenly without warning she slid off her stool into the hearth snoring loudly the empty bottle of butterbeer rolled away across the stoneflagged floor half a dozen houseelves came hurrying forward looking disgusted one of them picked up the bottle the others covered winky with a large checked tablecloth and tucked the ends in neatly hiding her from viewwe is sorry you had to see that sirs and miss squeaked a nearby elf shaking his head and looking very ashamed we is hoping you will not judge us all by winky sirs and missshes unhappy said hermione exasperated why dont you try and cheer her up instead of covering her upbegging your pardon miss said the houseelf bowing deeply again but houseelves has no right to be unhappy when there is work to be done and masters to be servedoh for heavens sake hermione cried listen to me all of you youve got just as much right as wizards to be unhappy youve got the right to wages and holidays and proper clothes you dont have to do everything youre told look at dobbymiss will please keep dobby out of this dobby mumbled looking scared the cheery smiles had vanished from the faces of the houseelves around the kitchen they were suddenly looking at hermione as though she were mad and dangerouswe has your extra food squeaked an elf at harrys elbow and he shoved a large ham a dozen cakes and some fruit into harrys arms goodbyethe houseelves crowded around harry ron and hermione and began shunting them out of the kitchen many little hands pushing in the smalls of their backsthank you for the socks harry potter dobby called miserably from the hearth where he was standing next to the lumpy tablecloth that was winkyyou couldnt keep your mouth shut could you hermione said ron angrily as the kitchen door slammed shut behind them they wont want us visiting them now we couldve tried to get more stuff out of winky about crouchoh as if you care about that scoffed hermione you only like coming down here for the foodit was an irritable sort of day after that harry got so tired of ron and hermione sniping at each other over their homework in the common room that he took siriuss food up to the owlery that evening on his ownpigwidgeon was much too small to carry an entire ham up to the mountain by himself so harry enlisted the help of two school screech owls as well when they had set off into the dusk looking extremely odd carrying the large package between them harry leaned on the windowsill looking out at the grounds at the dark rustling treetops of the forbidden forest and the rippling sails of the durmstrang ship an eagle owl flew through the coil of smoke rising from hagrids chimney it soared toward the castle around the owlery and out of sight looking down harry saw hagrid digging energetically in front of his cabin harry wondered what he was doing it looked as though he were making a new vegetable patch as he watched madame maxime emerged from the beauxbatons carriage and walked over to hagrid she appeared to be trying to engage him in conversation hagrid leaned upon his spade but did not seem keen to prolong their talk because madame maxime returned to the carriage shortly afterwardunwilling to go back to gryffindor tower and listen to ron and hermione snarling at each other harry watched hagrid digging until the darkness swallowed him and the owls around harry began to awake swooshing past him into the nightby breakfast the next day rons and hermiones bad moods had burnt out and to harrys relief rons dark predictions that the houseelves would send substandard food up to the gryffindor table because hermione had insulted them proved false the bacon eggs and kippers were quite as good as usualwhen the post owls arrived hermione looked up eagerly she seemed to be expecting somethingpercy wontve had time to answer yet said ron we only sent hedwig yesterdayno its not that said hermione ive taken out a subscription to the daily prophet im getting sick of finding everything out from the slytherinsgood thinking said harry also looking up at the owls hey hermione i think youre in luck a gray owl was soaring down toward hermioneit hasnt got a newspaper though she said looking disappointed its but to her bewilderment the gray owl landed in front of her plate closely followed by four barn owls a brown owl and a tawnyhow many subscriptions did you take out said harry seizing hermiones goblet before it was knocked over by the cluster of owls all of whom were jostling close to her trying to deliver their own letter firstwhat on earth hermione said taking the letter from the gray owl opening it and starting to read oh really she sputtered going rather redwhats up said ronits oh how ridiculous she thrust the letter at harry who saw that it was not handwritten but composed from pasted letters that seemed to have been cut out of the daily prophetyou are a wicked girl harry potter deservesbetter go back where you came from muggletheyre all like it said hermione desperately opening one letter after another harry potter can do much better than the likes of you you deserve to be boiled in frog spawn ouchshe had opened the last envelope and yellowishgreen liquid smelling strongly of petrol gushed over her hands which began to erupt in large yellow boilsundiluted bubotuber pus said ron picking up the envelope gingerly and sniffing itow said hermione tears starting in her eyes as she tried to rub the pus off her hands with a napkin but her fingers were now so thickly covered in painful sores that it looked as though she were wearing a pair of thick knobbly glovesyoud better get up to the hospital wing said harry as the owls around hermione took flight well tell professor sprout where youve gone i warned her said ron as hermione hurried out of the great hall cradling her hands i warned her not to annoy rita skeeter look at this one he read out one of the letters hermione had left behind i read in witch weekly about how you are playing harry potter false and that boy has had enough hardship and i will be sending you a curse by next post as soon as i can find a big enough envelope blimey shed better watch out for herselfhermione didnt turn up for herbology as harry and ron left the greenhouse for their care of magical creatures class they saw malfoy crabbe and goyle descending the stone steps of the castle pansy parkinson was whispering and giggling behind them with her gang of slytherin girls catching sight of harry pansy called potter have you split up with your girlfriend why was she so upset at breakfastharry ignored her he didnt want to give her the satisfaction of knowing how much trouble the witch weekly article had causedhagrid who had told them last lesson that they had finished with unicorns was waiting for them outside his cabin with a fresh supply of open crates at his feet harrys heart sank at the sight of the crates surely not another skrewt hatching but when he got near enough to see inside he found himself looking at a number of flurry black creatures with long snouts their front paws were curiously flat like spades and they were blinking up at the class looking politely puzzled at all the attentionthesere nifflers said hagrid when the class had gathered around yeh find em down mines mostly they like sparkly stuff there yeh go lookone of the nifflers had suddenly leapt up and attempted to bite pansy parkinsons watch off her wrist she shrieked and jumped backwarduseful little treasure detectors said hagrid happily thought wed have some fun with em today see over there he pointed at the large patch of freshly turned earth harry had watched him digging from the owlery window ive buried some gold coins ive got a prize fer whoever picks the niffler that digs up most jus take off all yer valuables an choose a niffler an get ready ter set em looseharry took off his watch which he was only wearing out of habit as it didnt work anymore and stuffed it into his pocket then he picked up a niffler it put its long snout in harrys ear and sniffed enthusiastically it was really quite cuddlyhang on said hagrid looking down into the crate theres a spare niffler here whos missin wheres hermioneshe had to go to the hospital wing said ronwell explain later harry muttered pansy parkinson was listeningit was easily the most fun they had ever had in care of magical creatures the nifflers dived in and out of the patch of earth as though it were water each scurrying back to the student who had released it and spitting gold into their hands rons was particularly efficient it had soon filled his lap with coinscan you buy these as pets hagrid he asked excitedly as his niffler dived back into the soil splattering his robesyer mum wouldn be happy ron said hagrid grinning they wreck houses nifflers i reckon theyve nearly got the lot now he added pacing around the patch of earth while the nifflers continued to dive i ony buried a hundred coins oh there yare hermionehermione was walking toward them across the lawn her hands were very heavily bandaged and she looked miserable pansy parkinson was watching her beadilywell lets check how yehve done said hagrid count yer coins an theres no point tryin ter steal any goyle he added his beetleblack eyes narrowed its leprechaun gold vanishes after a few hoursgoyle emptied his pockets looking extremely sulky it turned out that rons niffler had been most successful so hagrid gave him an enormous slab of honeydukes chocolate for a prize the bell rang across the grounds for lunch the rest of the class set off back to the castle but harry ron and hermione stayed behind to help hagrid put the nifflers back in their boxes harry noticed madame maxime watching them out other carriage windowwhat yeh done ter your hands hermione said hagrid looking concernedhermione told him about the hate mail she had received that morning and the envelope full of bubotuber pusaaah don worry said hagrid gendy looking down at her i got some o those letters an all after rita skeeter wrote abou me mum yehre a monster an yeh should be put down yer mother killed innocent people an if you had any decency you d jump in a lakeno said hermione looking shockedyeah said hagrid heaving the niffler crates over by his cabin wall theyre jus nutters hermione don open em if yeh get any more chuck em straigh in the fireyou missed a really good lesson harry told hermione as they headed back toward the castle theyre good nifflers arent they ronron however was frowning at the chocolate hagrid had given him he looked thoroughly put out about somethingwhats the matter said harry wrong flavorno said ron shortly why didnt you tell me about the goldwhat gold said harrythe gold i gave you at the quidditch world cup said ron the leprechaun gold i gave you for my omnioculars in the top box why didnt you tell me it disappearedharry had to think for a moment before he realized what ron was talking aboutoh he said the memory coming back to him at last i dunno i never noticed it had gone i was more worried about my wand wasnt ithey climbed the steps into the entrance hall and went into the great hall for lunchmust be nice ron said abruptly when they had sat down and started serving themselves roast beef and yorkshire puddings to have so much money you dont notice if a pocketful of galleons goes missinglisten i had other stuff on my mind that night s aid harry impatiently we all did rememberi didnt know leprechaun gold vanishes ron muttered i thought i was paying you back you shouldntve given me that chudley cannon hat for christmasforget it all right said harryron speared a roast potato on the end of his fork glaring at it then he said i hate being poorharry and hermione looked at each other neither of them really knew what to sayits rubbish said ron still glaring down at his potato i dont blame fred and george for trying to make some extra money wish i could wish i had a nifflerwell we know what to get you next christmas said hermione brightly then when ron continued to look gloomy she said come on ron it could be worse at least your fingers arent full of pus hermione was having a lot of difficulty managing her knife and fork her fingers were so stiff and swollen i hate that skeeter woman she burst out savagely ill get her back for this if its the last thing i dohate mail continued to arrive for hermione over the following week and although she followed hagrids advice and stopped opening it several of her illwishers sent howlers which exploded at the gryffindor table and shrieked insults at her for the whole hall to hear even those people who didnt read witch weekly knew all about the supposed harrykrumhermione triangle now harry was getting sick of telling people that hermione wasnt his girlfrienditll die down though he told hermione if we just ignore it people got bored with that stuff she wrote about me last timei want to know how shes listening into private conversations when shes supposed to be banned from the grounds said hermione angrilyhermione hung back in their next defense against the dark arts lesson to ask professor moody something the rest of the class was very eager to leave moody had given them such a rigorous test of hexdeflection that many of them were nursing small injuries harry had such a bad case of twitchy ears he had to hold his hands clamped over them as he walked away from the classwell ritas definitely not using an invisibility cloak hermione panted five minutes later catching up with harry and ron in the entrance hall and pulling harrys hand away from one of his wiggling ears so that he could hear her moody says he didnt see her anywhere near the judges table at the second task or anywhere near the lakehermione is there any point in telling you to drop this said ronno said hermione stubbornly i want to know how she heard me talking to viktor and how she found out about hagrids mummaybe she had you bugged said harrybugged said ron blankly what put fleas on her or somethingharry started explaining about hidden microphones and recording equipment ron was fascinated but hermione interrupted themarent you two ever going to read hogwarts a historywhats the point said ron you know it by heart we can just ask youall those substitutes for magic muggles use electricity computers and radar and all those things they all go haywire around hogwarts theres too much magic in the air no ritas using magic to eavesdrop she must be if i could just find out what it is ooh if its illegal ill have her havent we got enough to worry about ron asked her do we have to start a vendetta against rita skeeter as wellim not asking you to help hermione snapped ill do it on my ownshe marched back up the marble staircase without a backward glance harry was quite sure she was going to the librarywhats the betting she comes back with a box of hate rita skeeter badges said ronhermione however did not ask harry and ron to help her pursue vengeance against rita skeeter for which they were both grateful because their workload was mounting ever higher in the days before the easter holidays harry frankly marveled at the fact that hermione could research magical methods of eavesdropping as well as everything else they had to do he was working flatout just to get through all their homework though he made a point of sending regular food packages up to the cave in the mountain for sirius after last summer harry had not forgotten what it felt like to be continually hungry he enclosed notes to sirius telling him that nothing out of the ordinary had happened and that they were still waiting for an answer from percyhedwig didnt return until the end of the easter holidays percys letter was enclosed in a package of easter eggs that mrs weasley had sent both harrys and rons were the size of dragon eggs and full of homemade toffee hermiones however was smaller than a chicken egg her face fell when she saw ityour mum doesnt read witch weekly by any chance does she ron she asked quietlyyeah said ron whose mouth was full of toffee gets it for the recipeshermione looked sadly at her tiny eggdont you want to see what percys written harry asked her hastilypercys letter was short and irritatedas i am constantly telling the daily prophet mr crouch is taking a welldeserved break he is sending in regular owls with instructions no i havent actually seen him but i think i can be trusted to know my own superiors handwriting i have quite enough to do at the moment without trying to quash these ridiculous rumors please dont bother me again unless its something important happy easterthe start of the summer term would normally have meant that harry was training hard for the last quidditch match of the season this year however it was the third and final task in the triwizard tournament for which he needed to prepare but he still didnt know what he would have to do finally in the last week of may professor mcgonagall held him back in transfigurationyou are to go down to the quidditch field tonight at nine oclock potter she told him mr bagman will be there to tell the champions about the third taskso at half past eight that night harry left ron and hermione in gryffindor tower and went downstairs as he crossed the entrance hall cedric came up from the hufflepuff common roomwhat dyou reckon its going to be he asked harry as they went together down the stone steps out into the cloudy night fleur keeps going on about underground tunnels she reckons weve got to find treasurethat wouldnt be too bad said harry thinking that he would simply ask hagrid for a niffler to do the job for himthey walked down the dark lawn to the quidditch stadium turned through a gap in the stands and walked out onto the fieldwhatve they done to it cedric said indignantly stopping deadthe quidditch field was no longer smooth and flat it looked as though somebody had been building long low walls all over it that twisted and crisscrossed in every directiontheyre hedges said harry bending to examine the nearest onehello there called a cheery voiceludo bagman was standing in the middle of the field with krum and fleur harry and cedric made their way toward them climbing over the hedges fleur beamed at harry as he came nearer her attitude toward him had changed completely since he had saved her sister from the lakewell what dyou think said bagman happily as harry and cedric climbed over the last hedge growing nicely arent they give them a month and hagridll have them twenty feet high dont worry he added grinning spotting the lessthanhappy expressions on harrys and cedrics faces youll have your quidditch field back to normal once the task is over now i imagine you can guess what were making hereno one spoke for a moment then maze grunted krumthats right said bagman a maze the third tasks really very straightforward the triwizard cup will be placed in the center of the maze the first champion to touch it will receive full markswe seemply ave to get through the maze said fleurthere will be obstacles said bagman happily bouncing on the balls of his feet hagrid is providing a number of creatures then there will be spells that must be broken all that sort of thing you know now the champions who are leading on points will get a head start into the maze bagman grinned at harry and cedric then mr krum will enter then miss delacour but youll all be in with a fighting chance depending how well you get past the obstacles should be fun ehharry who knew only too well the kind of creatures that hagrid was likely to provide for an event like this thought it was unlikely to be any fun at all however he nodded politely like the other championsvery well if you havent got any questions well go back up to the castle shall we its a bit chilly bagman hurried alongside harry as they began to wend their way out of the growing maze harry had the feeling that bagman was going to start offering to help him again but just then krum tapped harry on the shouldercould i haff a vordyeah all right said harry slightly surprisedvill you valk vith meokay said harry curiouslybagman looked slightly perturbedill wait for you harry shall ino its okay mr bagman said harry suppressing a smile i think i can find the castle on my own thanksharry and krum left the stadium together but krum did not set a course for the durmstrang ship instead he walked toward the forestwhatre we going this way for said harry as they passed hagrid s cabin and the illuminated beauxbatons carriagedont vont to be overheard said krum shortlywhen at last they had reached a quiet stretch of ground a short way from the beauxbatons horses paddock krum stopped in the shade of the trees and turned to face harryi vant to know he said glowering vot there is between you and hermyownninnyharry who from krums secretive manner had expected something much more serious than this stared up at krum in amazementnothing he said but krum glowered at him and harry somehow struck anew by how tall krum was elaborated were friends shes not my girlfriend and she never has been its just that skeeter woman making things uphermyownninny talks about you very often said krum looking suspiciously at harryyeah said harry because were friendshe couldnt quite believe he was having this conversation with viktor krum the famous international quidditch player it was as though the eighteenyearold krum thought he harry was an equal a real rival you haff never you haff notno said harry very firmlykrum looked slightly happier he stared at harry for a few seconds then said you fly very veil i vos votching at the first taskthanks said harry grinning broadly and suddenly feeling much taller himself i saw you at the quidditch world cup the wronski feint you really but something moved behind krum in the trees and harry who had some experience of the sort of thing that lurked in the forest instinctively grabbed krums arm and pulled him aroundvot is itharry shook his head staring at the place where hed seen movement he slipped his hand inside his robes reaching for his wandsuddenly a man staggered out from behind a tall oak for a moment harry didnt recognize him then he realized it was mr crouchhe looked as though he had been traveling for days the knees of his robes were ripped and bloody his face scratched he was unshaven and gray with exhaustion his neat hair and mustache were both in need of a wash and a trim his strange appearance however was nothing to the way he was behaving muttering and gesticulating mr crouch appeared to be talking to someone that he alone could see he reminded harry vividly of an old tramp he had seen once when out shopping with the dursleys that man too had been conversing wildly with thin air aunt petunia had seized dudleys hand and pulled him across the road to avoid him uncle vernon had then treated the family to a long rant about what he would like to do with beggars and vagrantsvosnt he a judge said krum staring at mr crouch isnt he vith your ministryharry nodded hesitated for a moment then walked slowly toward mr crouch who did not look at him but continued to talk to a nearby treeand when youve done that weatherby send an owl to dumbledore confirming the number of durmstrang students who will be attending the tournament karkaroff has just sent word there will be twelve mr crouch said harry cautiouslyand then send another owl to madame maxime because she might want to up the number of students shes bringing now karkaroffs made it a round dozen do that weatherby will you will you willmr crouchs eyes were bulging he stood staring at the tree muttering soundlessly at it then he staggered sideways and fell to his kneesmr crouch harry said loudly are you all rightcrouchs eyes were rolling in his head harry looked around at krum who had followed him into the trees and was looking down at crouch in alarmvot is wrong with himno idea harry muttered listen youd better go and get someone dumbledore gasped mr crouch he reached out and seized a handful of harrys robes dragging him closer though his eyes were staring over harrys head i need see dumbledore okay said harry if you get up mr crouch we can go up to theive done stupid thing mr crouch breathed he looked utterly mad his eyes were rolling and bulging and a trickle of spittle was sliding down his chin every word he spoke seemed to cost him a terrible effort must tell dumbledore get up mr crouch said harry loudly and clearly get up ill take you to dumbledoremr crouchs eyes rolled forward onto harrywho you he whisperedim a student at the school said harry looking around at krum for some help but krum was hanging back looking extremely nervousyoure not his whispered crouch his mouth saggingno said harry without the faintest idea what crouch was talking aboutdumbledoresthats right said harrycrouch was pulling him closer harry tried to loosen crouchs grip on his robes but it was too powerfulwarn dumbledore ill get dumbledore if you let go of me said harry just let go mr crouch and ill get him thank you weatherby and when you have done that i would like a cup of tea my wife and son will be arriving shortly we are attending a concert tonight with mr and mrs fudgecrouch was now talking fluently to a tree again and seemed completely unaware that harry was there which surprised harry so much he didnt notice that crouch had released himyes my son has recently gained twelve owls most satisfactory yes thank you yes very proud indeed now if you could bring me that memo from the andorran minister of magic i think i will have time to draft a response you stay here with him harry said to krum ill get dumbledore ill be quicker i know where his office is he is mad said krum doubtfully staring down at crouch who was still gabbling to the tree apparently convinced it was percyjust stay with him said harry starting to get up but his movement seemed to trigger another abrupt change in mr crouch who seized him hard around the knees and pulled harry back to the grounddont leave me he whispered his eyes bulging again i escaped must warn must tell see dumbledore my fault all my fault bertha dead all my fault my son my fault tell dumbledore harry potter the dark lord stronger harry potter ill get dumbledore if you let me go mr crouch said harry he looked furiously around at krum help me will youlooking extremely apprehensive krum moved forward and squatted down next to mr crouchjust keep him here said harry pulling himself free of mr crouch ill be back with dumbledorehurry vont you krum called after him as harry sprinted away from the forest and up through the dark grounds they were deserted bagman cedric and fleur had disappeared harry tore up the stone steps through the oak front doors and off up the marble staircase toward the second floorfive minutes later he was hurtling toward a stone gargoyle standing halfway along an empty corridorsher sherbet lemon he panted at itthis was the password to the hidden staircase to dumbledores office or at least it had been two years ago the password had evidently changed however for the stone gargoyle did not spring to life and jump aside but stood frozen glaring at harry malevolentlymove harry shouted at it cmonbut nothing at hogwarts had ever moved just because he shouted at it he knew it was no good he looked up and down the dark corridor perhaps dumbledore was in the staffroom he started running as fast as he could toward the staircase potterharry skidded to a halt and looked around snape had just emerged from the hidden staircase behind the stone gargoyle the wall was sliding shut behind him even as he beckoned harry back toward himwhat are you doing here potteri need to see professor dumbledore said harry running back up the corridor and skidding to a standstill in front of snape instead its mr crouch hes just turned up hes in the forest hes asking what is this rubbish said snape his black eyes glittering what are you talking aboutmr crouch harry shouted from the ministry hes ill or something hes in the forest he wants to see dumbledore just give me the password up to the headmaster is busy potter said snape his thin mouth curling into an unpleasant smileive got to tell dumbledore harry yelleddidnt you hear me potterharry could tell snape was thoroughly enjoying himself denying harry the thing he wanted when he was so panickylook said harry angrily crouch isnt right hes hes out of his mind he says he wants to warn the stone wall behind snape slid open dumbledore was standing there wearing long green robes and a mildly curious expression is there a problem he said looking between harry and snapeprofessor harry said sidestepping snape before snape could speak mr crouch is here hes down in the forest he wants to speak to youharry expected dumbledore to ask questions but to his relief dumbledore did nothing of the sortlead the way he said promptly and he swept off along the corridor behind harry leaving snape standing next to the gargoyle and looking twice as uglywhat did mr crouch say harry said dumbledore as they walked swiftly down the marble staircasesaid he wants to warn you said hes done something terrible he mentioned his son and bertha jorkins and and voldemort something about voldemort getting stronger indeed said dumbledore and he quickened his pace as they hurried out into the pitchdarknesshes not acting normally harry said hurrying along beside dumbledore he doesnt seem to know where he is he keeps talking like he thinks percy weasleys there and then he changes and says he needs to see you i left him with viktor krumyou did said dumbledore sharply and he began to take longer strides still so that harry was running to keep up do you know if anybody else saw mr crouchno said harry krum and i were talking mr bagman had just finished telling us about the third task we stayed behind and then we saw mr crouch coming out of the forest where are they said dumbledore as the beauxbatons carriage emerged from the darknessover here said harry moving in front of dumbledore leading the way through the trees he couldnt hear crouchs voice anymore but he knew where he was going it hadnt been much past the beauxbatons carriage somewhere around here viktor harry shoutedno one answeredthey were here harry said to dumbledore they were definitely somewhere around here lumos dumbledore said lighting his wand and holding it upits narrow beam traveled from black trunk to black trunk illuminating the ground and then it fell upon a pair of feetharry and dumbledore hurried forward krum was sprawled on the forest floor he seemed to be unconscious there was no sign at all of mr crouch dumbledore bent over krum and gently lifted one of his eyelidsstunned he said softly his halfmoon glasses glittered in the wandlight as he peered around at the surrounding treesshould i go and get someone said harry madam pomfreyno said dumbledore swiftly stay herehe raised his wand into the air and pointed it in the direction of hagrids cabin harry saw something silvery dart out of it and streak away through the trees like a ghostly bird then dumbledore bent over krum again pointed his wand at him and muttered ennervatekrum opened his eyes he looked dazed when he saw dumbledore he tried to sit up but dumbledore put a hand on his shoulder and made him lie stillhe attacked me krum muttered putting a hand up to his head the old madman attacked me i vos looking around to see vare potter had gone and he attacked from behindlie still for a moment dumbledore saidthe sound of thunderous footfalls reached them and hagrid came panting into sight with fang at his heels he was carrying his crossbowprofessor dumbledore he said his eyes widening harry what the hagrid i need you to fetch professor karkaroff said dumbledore his student has been attacked when youve done that kindly alert professor moody no need dumbledore

until they heard the unmistakable sounds of hagrid and fang returning karkaroff was hurrying along behind them he was wearing his sleek silver furs and he looked pale and agitatedwhat is this he cried when he saw krum on the ground and dumbledore and harry beside him whats going oni vos attacked said krum sitting up now and rubbing his head mr crouch or votever his name crouch attacked you crouch attacked you the triwizard judgeigor dumbledore began but karkaroff had drawn himself up clutching his furs around him looking lividtreachery he bellowed pointing at dumbledore it is a plot you and your ministry of magic have lured me here under false pretenses dumbledore this is not an equal competition first you sneak potter into the tournament though he is underage now one of your ministry friends attempts to put my champion out of action i smell doubledealing and corruption in this whole affair and you dumbledore you with your talk of closer internationalwizarding links of rebuilding old ties of forgetting old differences heres what i think of youkarkaroff spat onto the ground at dumbledores feet in one swift movement hagrid seized the front of karkaroffs furs lifted him into the air and slammed him against a nearby treeapologize hagrid snarled as karkaroff gasped for breath hagrids massive fist at his throat his feet dangling in midairhagrid no dumbledore shouted his eyes flashinghagrid removed the hand pinning karkaroff to the tree and karkaroff slid all the way down the trunk and slumped in a huddle at its roots a few twigs and leaves showered down upon his headkindly escort harry back up to the castle hagrid said dumbledore sharplybreathing heavily hagrid gave karkaroff a glowering lookmaybe id better stay here headmaster you will take harry back to school hagrid dumbledore repeated firmly take him right up to gryffindor tower and harry i want you to stay there anything you might want to do any owls you might want to send they can wait until

trust any ofemhagrid was in such a bad mood harry was quite glad to say goodbye to him in front of the fat lady he clambered through the portrait hole into the common room and hurried straight for the corner where ron and hermione were sitting to tell them what had happenedchapter twentynine the dreamit comes down to this said hermione rubbing her forehead either mr crouch attacked viktor or somebody else attacked both of them when viktor wasnt lookingit mustve been crouch said ron at once thats why he was gone when harry and dumbledore got there hed done a runneri dont think so said harry shaking his head he seemed really weak i dont reckon he was up to disapparating or anythingyou cant disapparate on the hogwarts grounds havent i told you enough times said hermioneokay hows this for a theory said ron excitedly krum attacked crouch no wait for it and then stunned himselfand mr crouch evaporated did he said hermione coldlyoh yeah it was daybreak harry ron and hermione had crept out of their dormitories very early and hurried up to the owlery together to send a note to sirius now they were standing looking out at the misty grounds all three of them were puffyeyed and pale because they had been talking late into the night about mr crouchjust go through it again harry said hermione what did mr crouch actually sayive told you he wasnt making much sense said harry he said he wanted to warn dumbledore about something he definitely mentioned bertha jorkins and he seemed to think she was dead he kept saying stuff was his fault he mentioned his sonwell that was his fault said hermione testilyhe was out of his mind said harry half the time he seemed to think his wife and son were still alive and he kept talking to percy about work and giving him instructionsand remind me what he said about youknowwho said ron tentativelyive told you harry repeated dully he said hes getting strongerthere was a pause then ron said in a falsely confident voice but he was out of his mind like you said so half of it was probably just raving he was sanest when he was trying to talk about voldemort said harry and ron winced at the sound of the name he was having real trouble stringing two words together but that was when he seemed to know where he was and know what he wanted to do he just kept saying he had to see dumbledoreharry turned away from the window and stared up into the rafters the many perches were halfempty every now and then another owl would swoop in through one of the windows returning from its nights hunting with a mouse in its beakif snape hadnt held me up harry said bitterly we mightve got there in time the headmaster is busy potter whats this rubbish potter why couldnt he have just got out of the waymaybe he didnt want you to get there said ron quickly maybe hang on how fast dyou reckon he couldve gotten down to the forest dyou reckon he couldve beaten you and dumbledore therenot unless he can turn himself into a bat or something said harrywouldnt put it past him ron mutteredwe need to see professor moody said hermione we need to find out whether he found mr crouchif he had the marauders map on him it wouldve been easy said harryunless crouch was already outside the grounds said ron because it only shows up to the boundaries doesnt shh said hermione suddenlysomebody was climbing the steps up to the owlery harry could hear two voices arguing coming closer and closerthats blackmail that is we could get into a lot of trouble for thatweve tried being polite its time to play dirty like him he wouldnt like the ministry of magic knowing what he did im telling you if you put that in writing its blackmailyeah and you wont be complaining if we get a nice fat payoff will youthe owlery door banged open fred and george came over the threshold then froze at the sight of harry ron and hermionewhatre you doing here ron and fred said at the same timesending a letter said harry and george in unisonwhat at this time said hermione and fredfred grinnedfine we wont ask you what youre doing if you dont ask us he saidhe was holding a sealed envelope in his hands harry glanced at it but fred whether accidentally or on purpose shifted his hand so that the name on it was coveredwell dont let us hold you up fred said making a mock bow and pointing at the doorron didnt move whore you blackmailing he saidthe grin vanished from freds face harry saw george half glance at fred before smiling at rondont be stupid i was only joking he said easilydidnt sound like that said ronfred and george looked at each other then fred said abruptly ive told you before ron keep your nose out if you like it the shape it is cant see why you would but its my business if youre blackmailing someone said ron georges right you could end up in serious trouble for thattold you i was joking said george he walked over to fred pulled the letter out of his hands and began attaching it to the leg of the nearest barn owl youre starting to sound a bit like our dear older brother you are ron carry on like this and youll be made a prefectno i wont said ron hotlygeorge carried the barn owl over to the window and it took off george turned around and grinned at ronwell stop telling people what to do then see you laterhe and fred left the owlery harry ron and hermione stared at one anotheryou dont think they know something about all this do you hermione whispered about crouch and everythingno said harry if it was something that serious theyd tell someone theyd tell dumbledoreron however was looking uncomfortablewhats the matter hermione asked himwell said ron slowly i dunno if they would theyre theyre obsessed with making money lately i noticed it when i was hanging around with them when you know we werent talking harry finished the sentence for him yeah but blackmailits this joke shop idea theyve got said ron i thought they were only saying it to annoy mum but they really mean it they want to start one theyve only got a year left at hogwarts they keep going on about how its time to think about their future and dad cant help them and they need gold to get startedhermione was looking uncomfortable nowyes but they wouldnt do anything against the law to get goldwouldnt they said ron looking skeptical i dunno they dont exactly mind breaking rules do theyyes but this is the law said hermione looking scared this isnt some silly school rule theyll get a lot more than detention for blackmail ron maybe youd better tell percy are you mad said ron tell percy hed probably do a crouch and turn them in he stared at the window through which fred and georges owl had departed then said come on lets get some breakfastdyou think its too early to go and see professor moody hermione said as they went down the spiral staircaseyes said harry hed probably blast us through the door if we wake him at the crack of dawn hell think were trying to attack him while hes asleep lets give it till breakhistory of magic had rarely gone so slowly harry kept checking rons watch having finally discarded his own but rons was moving so slowly he could have sworn it had stopped working too all three of them were so tired they could happily have put their heads down on the desks and slept even hermione wasnt taking her usual notes but was sitting with her head on her hand gazing at professor binns with her eyes out of focuswhen the bell finally rang they hurried out into the corridors toward the dark arts classroom and found professor moody leaving it he looked as tired as they felt the eyelid of his normal eye was drooping giving his face an even more lopsided appearance than usualprofessor moody harry called as they made their way toward him through the crowdhello potter growled moody his magical eye followed a couple of passing first years who sped up looking nervous it rolled into the back of moodys head and watched them around the corner before he spoke againcome in herehe stood back to let them into his empty classroom limped in after them and closed the doordid you find him harry asked without preamble mr crouchno said moody he moved over to his desk sat down stretched out his wooden leg with a slight groan and pulled out his hip flaskdid you use the map harry saidof course said moody taking a swig from his flask took a leaf out of your book potter summoned it from my office into the forest he wasnt anywhere on thereso he did disapparate said ronyou cant disapparate on the grounds ron said hermione there are other ways he could have disappeared arent there professormoodys magical eye quivered as it rested on hermione youre another one who might think about a career as an auror he told her mind works the right way grangerhermione flushed pink with pleasurewell he wasnt invisible said harry the map shows invisible people he mustve left the grounds thenbut under his own steam said hermione eagerly or because someone made himyeah someone couldve couldve pulled him onto a broom and flown off with him couldnt they said ron quickly looking hopefully at moody as if he too wanted to be told he had the makings of an aurorwe cant rule out kidnap growled moodyso said ron dyou reckon hes somewhere in hogsmeadecould be anywhere said moody shaking his head only thing we know for sure is that hes not herehe yawned widely so that his scars stretched and his lopsided mouth revealed a number of missing teeth then he said now dumbledores told me you three fancy yourselves as investigators but theres nothing you can do for crouch the ministryll be looking for him now dumbledores notified them potter you just keep your mind on the third taskwhat said harry oh yeah he hadnt given the maze a single thought since hed left it with krum the previous nightshould be right up your street this one said moody looking up at harry and scratching his scarred and stubbly chin from what dumbledores said youve managed to get through stuff like this plenty of times broke your way through a series of obstacles guarding the sorcerers stone in your first year didnt youwe helped ron said quickly me and hermione helpedmoody grinnedwell help him practice for this one and ill be very surprised if he doesnt win said moody in the meantime constant vigilance potter constant vigilance he took another long draw from his hip flask and his magical eye swiveled onto the window the topmost sail of the durmstrang ship was visible through ityou two counseled moody his normal eye on ron and hermione you stick close to potter all right im keeping an eye on things but all the same you can never have too many eyes outsirius sent their owl back the very next morning it fluttered down beside harry at the same moment that a tawny owl landed in front of hermione clutching a copy of the daily prophet in its beak she took the newspaper scanned the first few pages said ha she hasnt got wind of crouch then joined ron and harry in reading what sirius had to say on the mysterious events of the night before lastharry what do you think you are playing at walking off into the forest with viktor krum i want you to swear by return owl that you are not going to go walking with anyone else at night there is somebody highly dangerous at hogwarts it is clear to me that they wanted to stop crouch from seeing dumbledore and you were probably feet away from them in the dark you could have been killedyour name didnt get into the goblet of fire by accident if someones trying to attack you theyre on their last chance stay close to ron and hermione do not leave gryffindor tower after hours and arm yourself for the third task practice stunning and disarming a few hexes wouldnt go amiss either theres nothing you can do about crouch keep your head down and look after yourself im waiting for your letter giving me your word you wont stray outofbounds againsiriuswhos he to lecture me about being outofbounds said harry in mild indignation as he folded up siriuss letter and put it inside his robes after all the stuff he did at schoolhes worried about you said hermione sharply just like moody and hagrid so listen to themno ones tried to attack me all year said harry no ones done anything to me at allexcept put your name in the goblet of fire said hermione and they mustve done that for a reason harry snuffles is right maybe theyve been biding their time maybe this is the task theyre going to get youlook said harry impatiently lets say sirius is right and someone stunned krum to kidnap crouch well they wouldve been in the trees near us wouldnt they but they waited till i was out of the way until they acted didnt they so it doesnt look like im their target does itthey couldnt have made it look like an accident if theyd murdered you in the forest said hermione but if you die during a taskthey didnt care about attacking krum did they said harry why didnt they just polish me off at the same time they couldve made it look like krum and i had a duel or somethingharry i dont understand it either said hermione desperately i just know there are a lot of odd things going on and i dont like it moodys right sirius is right youve got to get in training for the third task straight away and you make sure you write back to sirius and promise him youre not going to go sneaking off alone againthe hogwarts grounds never looked more inviting than when harry had to stay indoors for the next few days he spent all of his free time either in the library with hermione and ron looking up hexes or else in empty classrooms which they sneaked into to practice harry was concentrating on the stunning spell which he had never used before the trouble was that practicing it involved certain sacrifices on rons and hermiones partcant we kidnap mrs norris ron suggested on monday lunchtime as he lay flat on his back in the middle of their charms classroom having just been stunned and reawoken by harry for the fifth time in a row lets stun her for a bit or you could use dobby harry i bet hed do anything to help you im not complaining or anything he got gingerly to his feet rubbing his backside but im aching all over well you keep missing the cushions dont you said hermione impatiently rearranging the pile of cushions they had used for the banishing spell which flitwick had left in a cabinet just try and fall backwardonce youre stunned you cant aim too well hermione said ron angrily why dont you take a turnwell i think harrys got it now anyway said hermione hastily and we dont have to worry about disarming because hes been able to do that for ages i think we ought to start on some of these hexes this eveningshe looked down the list they had made in the libraryi like the look of this one she said this impediment curse should slow down anything thats trying to attack you harry well start with that onethe bell rang they hastily shoved the cushions back into flitwicks cupboard and slipped out of the classroomsee you at dinner said hermione and she set off for arithmancy while harry and ron headed toward north tower and divination broad strips of dazzling gold sunlight tell across the corridor from the high windows the sky outside was so brightly blue it looked as though it had been enameledits going to be boiling in trelawneys room she never puts out that fire said ron as they started up the staircase toward the silver ladder and the trapdoorhe was quite right the dimly lit room was swelteringly hot the fumes from the perfumed fire were heavier than ever harrys head swam as he made his way over to one of the curtained windows while professor trelawney was looking the other way disentangling her shawl from a lamp he opened it an inch or so and settled back in his chintz armchair so that a soft breeze played across his face it was extremely comfortablemy dears said professor trelawney sitting down in her winged armchair in front of the class and peering around at them all with her strangely enlarged eyes we have almost finished our work on planetary divination today however will be an excellent opportunity to examine the effects of mars for he is placed most interestingly at the present time if you will all look this way i will dim the lights she waved her wand and the lamps went out the fire was the only source of light now professor trelawney bent down and lifted from under her chair a miniature model of the solar system contained within a glass dome it was a beautiful thing each of the moons glimmered in place around the nine planets and the fiery sun all of them hanging in thin air beneath the glass harry watched lazily as professor trelawney began to point out the fascinating angle mars was making to neptune the heavily perfumed fumes washed over him and the breeze from the window played across his face he could hear an insect humming gently somewhere behind the curtain his eyelids began to droop he was riding on the back of an eagle owl soaring through the clear blue sky toward an old ivycovered house set high on a hillside lower and lower they flew the wind blowing pleasantly in harrys face until they reached a dark and broken window in the upper story of the house and entered now they were flying along a gloomy passageway to a room at the very end through the door they went into a dark room whose windows were boarded upharry had left the owls back he was watching now as it fluttered across the room into a chair with its back to him there were two dark shapes on the floor beside the chair both of them were stirring one was a huge snake the other was a man a short balding man a man with watery eyes and a pointed nose he was wheezing and sobbing on the hearth rug you are in luck wormtail said a cold highpitched voice from the depths of the chair in which the owl had landed you are very fortunate indeed your blunder has not ruined everything he is deadmy lord gasped the man on the floor my lord i am i am so pleased and so sorry nagini said the cold voice you are out of luck i will not be feeding wormtail to you after all but never mind never mind there is still harry potter the snake hissed harry could see its tongue flutteringnow wormtail said the cold voice perhaps one more little reminder why i will not tolerate another blunder from you my lord no i beg you the tip of a wand emerged from around the back of the chair it was pointing at wormtailcrucio said the cold voicewormtail screamed screamed as though every nerve in his body were on fire the screaming filled harrys ears as the scar on his forehead seared with pain he was yelling toovoldemort would hear him would know he was there harry harryharry opened his eyes he was lying on the floor of professor trelawneys room with his hands over his face his scar was still burning so badly that his eyes were watering the pain had been real the whole class was standing around him and ron was kneeling next to him looking terrifiedyou all right he saidof course he isnt said professor trelawney looking thoroughly excited her great eyes loomed over harry gazing at him what was it potter a premonition an apparition what did you seenothing harry lied he sat up he could feel himself shaking he couldnt stop himself from looking around into the shadows behind him voldemorts voice had sounded so close you were clutching your scar said professor trelawney you were rolling on the floor clutching your scar come now potter i have experience in these mattersharry looked up at heri need to go to the hospital wing i think he said bad headachemy dear you were undoubtedly stimulated by the extraordinary clairvoyant vibrations of my room said professor trelawney if you leave now you may lose the opportunity to see further than you have ever i dont want to see anything except a headache cure said harryhe stood up the class backed away they all looked unnervedsee you later harry muttered to ron and he picked up his bag and headed for the trapdoor ignoring professor trelawney who was wearing an expression of great frustration as though she had just been denied a real treatwhen harry reached the bottom of her stepladder however he did not set off for the hospital wing he had no intention whatsoever of going there sirius had told him what to do if his scar hurt him again and harry was going to follow his advice he was going straight to dumbledores office he marched down the corridors thinking about what he had seen in the dream it had been as vivid as the one that had awoken him on privet drive he ran over the details in his mind trying to make sure he could remember them he had heard voldemort accusing wormtail of making a blunder but the owl had brought good news the blunder had been repaired somebody was dead so wormtail was not going to be fed to the snake he harry was going to be fed to it instead harry had walked right past the stone gargoyle guarding the entrance to dumbledores office without noticing he blinked looked around realized what he had done and retraced his steps stopping in front of it then he remembered that he didnt know the passwordsherbet lemon he tried tentativelythe gargoyle did not moveokay said harry staring at it pear drop er licorice wand fizzing whizbee droobles best blowing gum bertie botts every flavor beans oh no he doesnt like them does he oh just open cant you he said angrily i really need to see him its urgentthe gargoyle remained immovableharry kicked it achieving nothing but an excruciating pain in his big toechocolate frog he yelled angrily standing on one leg sugar quill cockroach clusterthe gargoyle sprang to life and jumped aside harry blinkedcockroach cluster he said amazed i was only joking he hurried through the gap in the walls and stepped onto the foot of a spiral stone staircase which moved slowly upward as the doors closed behind him taking him up to a polished oak door with a brass door knockerhe could hear voices from inside the office he stepped off the moving staircase and hesitated listeningdumbledore im afraid i dont see the connection dont see it at all it was the voice of the minister of magic cornelius fudge ludo says berthas perfectly capable of getting herself lost i agree we would have expected to have found her by now but all the same weve no evidence of foul play dumbledore none at all as for her disappearance being linked with barty crouchsand what do you thinks happened to barty crouch minister said moodys growling voicei see two possibilities alastor said fudge either crouch has finally cracked more than likely im sure youll agree given his personal history lost his mind and gone wandering off somewhere he wandered extremely quickly if that is the case cornelius said dumbledore calmlyor else well fudge sounded embarrassed well ill reserve judgment until after ive seen the place where he was found but you say it was just past the beauxbatons carriage dumbledore you know what that woman isi consider her to be a very able headmistress and an excellent dancer said dumbledore quietlydumbledore come said fudge angrily dont you think you might be prejudiced in her favor because of hagrid they dont all turn out harmless if indeed you can call hagrid harmless with that monster fixation hes got i no more suspect madame maxime than hagrid said dumbledore just as calmly i think it possible that it is you who are prejudiced corneliuscan we wrap up this discussion growled moodyyes yes lets go down to the grounds then said fudge impatientlyno its not that said moody its just that potter wants a word with you dumbledore hes just outside the doorchapter thirty the pensieve the door of the office opened hello potter said moody come in thenharry walked inside he had been inside dumbledores office once before it was a very beautiful circular room lined with pictures of previous headmasters and headmistresses of hogwarts all of whom were fast asleep their chests rising and falling gentlycornelius fudge was standing beside dumbledores desk wearing his usual pinstriped cloak and holding his limegreen bowler hatharry said fudge jovially moving forward how are youfine harry liedwe were just talking about the night when mr crouch turned up on the grounds said fudge it was you who found him was it notyes said harry then feeling it was pointless to pretend that he hadnt overheard what they had been saying he added i didnt see madame maxime anywhere though and shed have a job hiding wouldnt shedumbledore smiled at harry behind fudges back his eyes twinklingyes well said fudge looking embarrassed were about to go for a short walk on the grounds harry if youll excuse us perhaps if you just go back to your class i wanted to talk to you professor harry said quickly looking at dumbledore who gave him a swift searching lookwait here for me harry he said our examination of the grounds will not take longthey trooped out in silence past him and closed the door after a minute or so harry heard the clunks of moodys wooden leg growing fainter in the corridor below he looked aroundhello fawkes he saidfawkes professor dumbledores phoenix was standing on his golden perch beside the door the size of a swan with magnificent scarletandgold plumage he swished his long tail and blinked benignly at harryharry sat down in a chair in front of dumbledores desk for several minutes he sat and watched the old headmasters and headmistresses snoozing in their frames thinking about what he had just heard and running his fingers over his scar it had stopped hurting nowhe felt much calmer somehow now that he was in dumbledores office knowing he would shortly be telling him about the dream harry looked up at the walls behind the desk the patched and ragged sorting hat was standing on a shelf a glass case next to it held a magnificent silver sword with large rubies set into the hilt which harry recognized as the one he himself had pulled out of the sorting hat in his second year the sword had once belonged to godric gryffindor founder of harrys house he was gazing at it remembering how it had come to his aid when he had thought all hope was lost when he noticed a patch of silvery light dancing and shimmering on the glass case he looked around for the source of the light and saw a sliver of silverwhite shining brightly from within a black cabinet behind him whose door had not been closed properly harry hesitated glanced at fawkes then got up walked across the office and pulled open the cabinet doora shallow stone basin lay there with odd carvings around the edge runes and symbols that harry did not recognize the silvery light was coming from the basins contents which were like nothing harry had ever seen before he could not tell whether the substance was liquid or gas it was a bright whitish silver and it was moving ceaselessly the surface of it became ruffled like water beneath wind and then like clouds separated and swirled smoothly it looked like light made liquid or like wind made solid harry couldnt make up his mindhe wanted to touch it to find out what it felt like but nearly four years experience of the magical world told him that sticking his hand into a bowl full of some unknown substance was a very stupid thing to do he therefore pulled his wand out of the inside of his robes cast a nervous look around the office looked back at the contents of the basin and prodded themthe surface of the silvery stuff inside the basin began to swirl very fastharry bent closer his head right inside the cabinet the silvery substance had become transparent it looked like glass he looked down into it expecting to see the stone bottom of the basin and saw instead an enormous room below the surface of the mysterious substance a room into which he seemed to be looking through a circular window in the ceilingthe room was dimly lit he thought it might even be underground for there were no windows merely torches in brackets such as the ones that illuminated the walls of hogwarts lowering his face so that his nose was a mere inch away from the glassy substance harry saw that rows and rows of witches and wizards were seated around every wall on what seemed to be benches rising in levels an empty chair stood in the very center of the room there was something about the chair that gave harry an ominous feeling chains encircled the arms of it as though its occupants were usually tied to itwhere was this place it surely wasnt hogwarts he had never seen a room like that here in the castle moreover the crowd in the mysterious room at the bottom of the basin was comprised of adults and harry knew there were not nearly that many teachers at hogwarts they seemed he thought to be waiting for something even though he could only see the tops of their hats all of their faces seemed to be pointing in one direction and none of them were talking to one anotherthe basin being circular and the room he was observing square harry could not make out what was going on in the corners of it he leaned even closer tilting his head trying to seethe tip of his nose touched the strange substance into which he was staringdumbledores office gave an almighty lurch harry was thrown forward and pitched headfirst into the substance inside the basin but his head did not hit the stone bottom he was falling through something icycold and black it was like being sucked into a dark whirlpool and suddenly harry found himself sitting on a bench at the end of the room inside the basin a bench raised high above the others he looked up at the high stone ceiling expecting to see the circular window through which he had just been staring but there was nothing there but dark solid stonebreathing hard and fast harry looked around him not one of the witches and wizards in the room and there were at least two hundred of them was looking at him not one of them seemed to have noticed that a fourteenyearold boy had just dropped from the ceiling into their midst harry turned to the wizard next to him on the bench and uttered a loud cry of surprise that reverberated around the silent roomhe was sitting right next to albus dumbledoreprofessor harry said in a kind of strangled whisper im sorry i didnt mean to i was just looking at that basin in your cabinet i where are webut dumbledore didnt move or speak he ignored harry completely like every other wizard on the benches he was staring into the far corner of the room where there was a doorharry gazed nonplussed at dumbledore then around at the silently watchful crowd then back at dumbledore and then it dawned on him once before harry had found himself somewhere that nobody could see or hear him that time he had fallen through a page in an enchanted diary right into somebody elses memory and unless he was very much mistaken something of the sort had happened againharry raised his right hand hesitated and then waved it energetically in from of dumbledores face dumbledore did not blink look around at harry or indeed move at all and that in harrys opinion settled the matter dumbledore wouldnt ignore him like that he was inside a memory and this was not the presentday dumbledore yet it couldnt be that long ago the dumbledore sitting next to him now was silverhaired just like the presentday dumbledore but what was this place what were all these wizards waiting forharry looked around more carefully the room as he had suspected when observing it from above was almost certainly underground more of a dungeon than a room he thought there was a bleak and forbidding air about the place there were no pictures on the walls no decorations at all just these serried rows of benches rising in levels all around the room all positioned so that they had a clear view of that chair with the chains on its armsbefore harry could reach any conclusions about the place in which they were he heard footsteps the door in the corner of the dungeon opened and three people entered or at least one man flanked by two dementorsharrys insides went cold the dementors tall hooded creatures whose faces were concealed were gliding slowly toward the chair in the center of the room each grasping one of the mans arms with their dead and rottenlooking hands the man between them looked as though he was about to faint and harry couldnt blame him he knew the dementors could not touch him inside a memory but he remembered their power only too well the watching crowd recoiled slightly as the dementors placed the man in the chained chair and glided back out of the room the door swung shut behind themharry looked down at the man now sitting in the chair and saw that it was karkaroffunlike dumbledore karkaroff looked much younger his hair and goatee were black he was not dressed in sleek furs but in thin and ragged robes he was shaking even as harry watched the chains on the arms of the chair glowed suddenly gold and snaked their way up karkaroffs arms binding him thereigor karkaroff said a curt voice to harrys left harry looked around and saw mr crouch standing up in the middle of the bench beside him crouchs hair was dark his face was much less lined he looked fit and alert you have been brought from azkaban to present evidence to the ministry of magic you have given us to understand that you have important information for uskarkaroff straightened himself as best he could tightly bound to the chairi have sir he said and although his voice was very scared harry could still hear the familiar unctuous note in it i wish to be of use to the ministry i wish to help i i know that the ministry is trying to to round up the last of the dark lords supporters i am eager to assist in any way i can there was a murmur around the benches some of the wizards and witches were surveying karkaroff with interest others with pronounced mistrust then harry heard quite distinctly from dumbledores other side a familiar growling voice saying filthharry leaned forward so that he could see past dumbledore madeye moody was sitting there except that there was a very noticeable difference in his appearance he did not have his magical eye but two normal ones both were looking down upon karkaroff and both were narrowed in intense dislikecrouch is going to let him out moody breathed quietly to dumbledore hes done a deal with him took me six months to track him down and crouch is going to let him go if hes got enough new names lets hear his information i say and throw him straight back to the dementorsdumbledore made a small noise of dissent through his long crooked noseah i was forgetting you dont like the dementors do you albus said moody with a sardonic smileno said dumbledore calmly im afraid i dont i have long felt the ministry is wrong to ally itself with such creaturesbut for filth like this moody said softlyyou say you have names for us karkaroff said mr crouch let us hear them pleaseyou must understand said karkaroff hurriedly that hewhomustnotbenamed operated always in the greatest secrecy he preferred that we i mean to say his supporters and i regret now very deeply that i ever counted myself among them get on with it sneered moodywe never knew the names of every one of our fellows he alone knew exactly who we all were which was a wise move wasnt it as it prevented someone like you karkaroff from turning all of them in muttered moodyyet you say you have some names for us said mr crouchi i do said karkaroff breathlessly and these were important supporters mark you people i saw with my own eyes doing his bidding i give this information as a sign that i fully and totally renounce him and am filled with a remorse so deep i can barely these names are said mr crouch sharplykarkaroff drew a deep breaththere was antonin dolohov he said i i saw him torture countless muggles and and nonsupporters of the dark lordand helped him do it murmured moodywe have already apprehended dolohov said crouch he was caught shortly after yourselfindeed said karkaroff his eyes widening i i am delighted to hear itbut he didnt look it harry could tell that this news had come as a real blow to him one of his names was worthlessany others said crouch coldlywhy yes there was rosier said karkaroff hurriedly evan rosierrosier is dead said crouch he was caught shortly after you were too he preferred to fight rather than come quietly and was killed in the struggletook a bit of me with him though whispered moody to harrys right harry looked around at him once more and saw him indicating the large chunk out of his nose to dumbledoreno no more than rosier deserved said karkaroff a real note of panic in his voice now harry could see that he was starting to worry that none of his information would be of any use to the ministry karkaroffs eyes darted toward the door in the corner behind which the dementors undoubtedly still stood waitingany more said crouchyes said karkaroff there was travers he helped murder the mckinnons mulciber he specialized in the imperius curse forced countless people to do horrific things rookwood who was a spy and passed hewhomustnotbenamed useful information from inside the ministry itselfharry could tell that this time karkaroff had struck gold the watching crowd was all murmuring togetherrookwood said mr crouch nodding to a witch sitting in front of him who began scribbling upon her piece of parchment augustus rookwood of the department of mysteriesthe very same said karkaroff eagerly i believe he used a network of wellplaced wizards both inside the ministry and out to collect information but travers and mulciber we have said mr crouch very well karkaroff if that is all you will be returned to azkaban while we decide not yet cried karkaroff looking quite desperate wait i have moreharry could see him sweating in the torchlight his white skin contrasting strongly with the black of his hair and beardsnape he shouted severus snapesnape has been cleared by this council said crouch disdainfully he has been vouched for by albus dumbledoreno shouted karkaroff straining at the chains that bound him to the chair i assure you severus snape is a death eaterdumbledore had gotten to his feeti have given evidence already on this matter he said calmly severus snape was indeed a death eater however he rejoined our side before lord voldemorts downfall and turned spy for us at great personal risk he is now no more a death eater than i amharry turned to look at madeye moody he was wearing a look of deep skepticism behind dumbledores backvery well karkaroff crouch said coldly you have been of assistance i shall review your case you will return to azkaban in the meantime mr crouchs voice faded harry looked around the dungeon was dissolving as though it were made of smoke everything was fading he could see only his own body all else was swirling darkness and then the dungeon returned harry was sitting in a different seat still on the highest bench but now to the left side of mr crouch the atmosphere seemed quite different relaxed even cheerful the witches and wizards all around the walls were talking to one another almost as though they were at some sort of sporting event harry noticed a witch halfway up the rows of benches opposite she had short blonde hair was wearing magenta robes and was sucking the end of an acidgreen quill it was unmistakably a younger rita skeeter harry looked around dumbledore was sitting beside him again wearing different robes mr crouch looked more tired and somehow fiercer gaunter harry understood it was a different memory a different day a different trialthe door in the corner opened and ludo bagman walked into the roomthis was not however a ludo bagman gone to seed but a ludo bagman who was clearly at the height of his quidditchplaying fitness his nose wasnt broken now he was tall and lean and muscular bagman looked nervous as he sat down in the chained chair but it did not bind him there as it had bound karkaroff and bagman perhaps taking heart from this glanced around at the watching crowd waved at a couple of them and managed a small smileludo bagman you have been brought here in front of the council of magical law to answer charges relating to the activities of the death eaters said mr crouch we have heard the evidence against you and are about to reach our verdict do you have anything to add to your testimony before we pronounce judgmentharry couldnt believe his ears ludo bagman a death eateronly said bagman smiling awkwardly well i know ive been a bit of an idiot one or two wizards and witches in the surrounding seats smiled indulgently mr crouch did not appear to share their feelings he was staring down at ludo bagman with an expression of the utmost severity and dislikeyou never spoke a truer word boy someone muttered dryly to dumbledore behind harry he looked around and saw moody sitting there again if i didnt know hed always been dim id have said some of those bludgers had permanently affected his brain ludovic bagman you were caught passing information to lord voldemorts supporters said mr crouch for this i suggest a term of imprisonment in azkaban lasting no less than but there was an angry outcry from the surrounding benches several of the witches and wizards around the walls stood up shaking their heads and even their fists at mr crouchbut ive told you i had no idea bagman called earnestly over the crowds babble his round blue eyes widening none at all old rookwood was a friend of my dads never crossed my mind he was in with youknowwho i thought i was collecting information for our side and rookwood kept talking about getting me a job in the ministry later on once my quidditch days are over you know i mean i cant keep getting hit by bludgers for the rest of my life can ithere were titters from the crowdit will be put to the vote said mr crouch coldly he turned to the righthand side of the dungeon the jury will please raise their hands those in favor of imprisonmentharry looked toward the righthand side of the dungeon not one person raised their hand many of the witches and wizards around the walls began to clap one of the witches on the jury stood upyes barked crouchwed just like to congratulate mr bagman on his splendid performance for england in the quidditch match against turkey last saturday the witch said breathlesslymr crouch looked furious the dungeon was ringing with applause now bagman got to his feet and bowed beamingdespicable mr crouch spat at dumbledore sitting down as bagman walked out of the dungeon rookwood get him a job indeed the day ludo bagman joins us will be a sad day indeed for the ministry and the dungeon dissolved again when it had returned harry looked around he and dumbledore were still sitting beside mr crouch but the atmosphere could not have been more different there was total silence broken only by the dry sobs of a frail wispylooking witch in the seat next to mr crouch she was clutching a handkerchief to her mouth with trembling handsharry looked up at crouch and saw that he looked gaunter and grayer than ever before a nerve was twitching in his templebring them in he said and his voice echoed through the silent dungeonthe door in the corner opened yet again six dementors entered this time flanking a group of four people harry saw the people in the crowd turn to look up at mr crouch a few of them whispered to one anotherthe dementors placed each of the four people in the four chairs with chained arms that now stood on the dungeon floor there was a thickset man who stared blankly up at crouch a thinner and more nervouslooking man whose eyes were darting around the crowd a woman with thick shining dark hair and heavily hooded eyes who was sitting in the chained chair as though it were a throne and a boy in his late teens who looked nothing short of petrified he was shivering his strawcolored hair all over his face his freckled skin milkwhite the wispy little witch beside crouch began to rock backward and forward in her seat whimpering into her handkerchiefcrouch stood up he looked down upon the four in front of him and there was pure hatred in his faceyou have been brought here before the council of magical law he said clearly so that we may pass judgment on you for a crime so heinous father said the boy with the strawcolored hair father please that we have rarely heard the like of it within this court said crouch speaking more loudly drowning out his sons voicewe have heard the evidence against you the four of you stand accused of capturing an auror frank longbottom and subjecting him to the cruciatus curse believing him to have knowledge of the present whereabouts of your exiled master hewhomustnotbenamed father i didnt shrieked the boy in chains below i didnt i swear it father dont send me back to the dementors you are further accused bellowed mr crouch of using the cruciatus curse on frank longbottoms wife when he would not give you information you planned to restore hewhomustnotbenamed to power and to resume the lives of violence you presumably led while he was strong i now ask the jury mother screamed the boy below and the wispy little witch beside crouch began to sob rocking backward and forward mother stop him mother i didnt do it it wasnt mei now ask the jury shouted mr crouch to raise their hands if they believe as i do that these crimes deserve a life sentence in azkabanin unison the witches and wizards along the righthand side of the dungeon raised their hands the crowd around the walls began to clap as it had for bagman their faces full of savage triumph the boy began to screamno mother no i didnt do it i didnt do it i didnt know dont send me there dont let himthe dementors were gliding back into the room the boys three companions rose quietly from their seats the woman with the heavylidded eyes looked up at crouch and called the dark lord will rise again crouch throw us into azkaban we will wait hewill rise again and will come for us he will reward us beyond any of his other supporters we alone were faithful we alone tried to find himbut the boy was trying to fight off the dementors even though harry could see their cold draining power starting to affect him the crowd was jeering some of them on their feet as the woman swept out of the dungeon and the boy continued to struggleim your son he screamed up at crouch im your sonyou are no son of mine bellowed mr crouch his eyes bulging suddenly i have no sonthe wispy witch beside him gave a great gasp and slumped in her seat she had fainted crouch appeared not to have noticedtake them away crouch roared at the dementors spit flying from his mouth take them away and may they rot therefather father i wasnt involved no no father pleasei think harry it is time to return to my office said a quiet voice in harrys earharry started he looked around then he looked on his other sidethere was an albus dumbledore sitting on his right watching crouchs son being dragged away by the dementors and there was an albus dumbledore on his left looking right at himcome said the dumbledore on his left and he put his hand under harrys elbow harry felt himself rising into the air the dungeon dissolved around him for a moment all was blackness and then he felt as though he had done a slowmotion somersault suddenly landing flat on his feet in what seemed like the dazzling light of dumbledores sunlit office the stone basin was shimmering in the cabinet in front of him and albus dumbledore was standing beside himprofessor harry gasped i know i shouldntve i didnt mean the cabinet door was sort of open and i quite understand said dumbledore he lifted the basin carried it over to his desk placed it upon the polished top and sat down in the chair behind it he motioned for harry to sit down opposite himharry did so staring at the stone basin the contents had returned to their original silverywhite state swirling and rippling beneath his gazewhat is it harry asked shakilythis it is called a pensieve said dumbledore i sometimes find and i am sure you know the feeling that i simply have too many thoughts and memories crammed into my minder said harry who couldnt truthfully say that he had ever felt anything of the sortat these times said dumbledore indicating the stone basin i use the pensieve one simply siphons the excess thoughts from ones mind pours them into the basin and examines them at ones leisure it becomes easier to spot patterns and links you understand when they are in this formyou mean that stuffs your thoughts harry said staring at the swirling white substance in the basincertainly said dumbledore let me show youdumbledore drew his wand out of the inside of his robes and placed the tip into his own silvery hair near his temple when he took the wand away hair seemed to be clinging to it but then harry saw that it was in fact a glistening strand of the same strange silverywhite substance that filled the pensieve dumbledore added this fresh thought to the basin and harry astonished saw his own face swimming around the surface of the bowl dumbledore placed his long hands on either side of the pensieve and swirled it rather as a gold prospector would pan for fragments of gold and harry saw his own face change smoothly into snapes who opened his mouth and spoke to the ceiling his voice echoing slightlyits coming back karkaroffs too stronger and clearer than evera connection i could have made without assistance dumbledore sighed but never mind he peered over the top of his halfmoon spectacles at harry who was gaping at snapes face which was continuing to swirl around the bowl i was using the pensieve when mr fudge arrived for our meeting and put it away rather hastily undoubtedly i did not fasten the cabinet door properly naturally it would have attracted your attentionim sorry harry mumbleddumbledore shook his head curiosity is not a sin he said but we should exercise caution with our curiosity yes indeed frowning slightly he prodded the thoughts within the basin with the tip of his wand instantly a figure rose out of it a plump scowling girl of about sixteen who began to revolve slowly with her feet still in the basin she took no notice whatsoever of harry or professor dumbledore when she spoke her voice echoed as snapes had done as though it were coming from the depths of the stone basin he put a hex on me professor dumbledore and iwas only teasing him sir i only said id seen him kissing florence behind the greenhouses last thursday but why bertha said dumbledore sadly looking up at the now silently revolving girl why did you have to follow him in the first placebertha harry whispered looking up at her is that was that bertha jorkinsyes said dumbledore prodding the thoughts in the basin again bertha sank back into them and they became silvery and opaque once more that was bertha as i remember her at schoolthe silvery light from the pensieve illuminated dumbledores face and it struck harry suddenly how very old he was looking he knew of course that dumbledore was getting on in years but somehow he never really thought of dumbledore as an old manso harry said dumbledore quietly before you got lost in my thoughts you wanted to tell me somethingyes said harry professor i was in divination just now and er i fell asleephe hesitated here wondering if a reprimand was coming but dumbledore merely said quite understandable continuewell i had a dream said harry a dream about lord voldemort he was torturing wormtail you know who wormtaili do know said dumbledore promptly please continuevoldemort got a letter from an owl he said something like wormtails blunder had been repaired he said someone was dead then he said wormtail wouldnt be fed to the snake there was a snake beside his chair he said he said hed be feeding me to itinstead then he did the cruciatus curse on wormtail and my scar hurt harry said it woke me up it hurt so badlydumbledore merely looked at himer thats all said harryi see said dumbledore quietly i see now has your scar hurt at any other time this year excepting the time it woke you up over the summerno i how did you know it woke me up over the summer said harry astonishedyou are not siriuss only correspondent said dumbledore i have also been in contact with him ever since he left hogwarts last year it was i who suggested the mountainside cave as the safest place for him to staydumbledore got up and began walking up and down behind his desk every now and then he placed his wand tip to his temple removed another shining silver thought and added it to the pensieve the thoughts inside began to swirl so fast that harry couldnt make out anything clearly it was merely a blur of colorprofessor he said quietly after a couple of minutesdumbledore stopped pacing and looked at harrymy apologies he said quietly he sat back down at his deskdyou dyou know why my scars hurting medumbledore looked very intently at harry for a moment and then said i have a theory no more than that it is my belief that your scar hurts both when lord voldemort is near you and when he is feeling a particularly strong surge of hatredbut whybecause you and he are connected by the curse that failed said dumbledore that is no ordinary scarso you think that dream did it really happenit is possible said dumbledore i would say probable harry did you see voldemortno said harry just the back of his chair but there wouldnt have been anything to see would there i mean he hasnt got a body has he but but then how could he have held the wand harry said slowlyhow indeed muttered dumbledore how indeed neither dumbledore nor harry spoke for a while dumbledore was gazing across the room and every now and then placing his wand tip to his temple and adding another shining silver thought to the seething mass within the pensieveprofessor harry said at last do you think hes getting strongervoldemort said dumbledore looking at harry over the pensieve it was the characteristic piercing look dumbledore had given him on other occasions and always made harry feel as though dumbledore were seeing right through him in a way that even moodys magical eye could not once again harry i can only give you my suspicionsdumbledore sighed again and he looked older and wearier than everthe years of voldemorts ascent to power he said were marked with disappearances bertha jorkins has vanished without a trace in the place where voldemort was certainly known to be last mr crouch too has disappeared within these very grounds and there was a third disappearance one which the ministry i regret to say do not consider of any importance for it concerns a muggle his name was frank bryce he lived in the village where voldemorts father grew up and he has not been seen since last august you see i read the muggle newspapers unlike most of my ministry friendsdumbledore looked very seriously at harrythese disappearances seem to me to be linked the ministry disagrees as you may have heard while waiting outside my officeharry nodded silence fell between them again dumbledore extracting thoughts every now and then harry felt as though he ought to go but his curiosity held him in his chairprofessor he said againyes harry said dumbledoreer could i ask you about that court thing i was in in the pensieveyou could said dumbledore heavily i attended it many times but some trials come back to me more clearly than others particularly now you know you know the trial you found me in the one with crouchs son wellwere they talking about nevilles parentsdumbledore gave harry a very sharp look has neville never told you why he has been brought up by his grandmother he saidharry shook his head wondering as he did so how he could have failed to ask neville this in almost four years of knowing himyes they were talking about nevilles parents said dumbledore his father frank was an auror just like professor moody he and his wife were tortured for information about voldemorts whereabouts after he lost his powers as you heardso theyre dead said harry quietlyno said dumbledore his voice full of a bitterness harry had never heard there before they are insane they are both in st mungos hospital for magical maladies and injuries i believe neville visits them with his grandmother during the holidays they do not recognize himharry sat there horrorstruck he had never known never in four years bothered to find out the longbottoms were very popular said dumbledore the attacks on them came after voldemorts fall from power just when everyone thought they were safe those attacks caused a wave of fury such as i have never known the ministry was under great pressure to catch those who had done it unfortunately the longbottoms evidence was given their condition none too reliablethen mr crouchs son might not have been involved said harry slowlydumbledore shook his headas to that i have no ideaharry sat in silence once more watching the contents of the pensieve swirl there were two more questions he was burning to ask but they concerned the guilt of living people er he said mr bagman has never been accused of any dark activity since said dumbledore calmlyright said harry hastily staring at the contents of the pensieve again which were swirling more slowly now that dumbledore had stopped adding thoughts and er but the pensieve seemed to be asking his question for himsnapes face was swimming on the surface again dumbledore glanced down into it and then up at harryno more has professor snape he saidharry looked into dumbledores light blue eyes and the thing he really wanted to know spilled out of his mouth before he could stop itwhat made you think hed really stopped supporting voldemort professordumbledore held harrys gaze for a few seconds and then said that harry is a matter between professor snape and myselfharry knew that the interview was over dumbledore did not look angry yet there was a finality in his tone that told harry it was time to go he stood up and so did dumbledoreharry he said as harry reached the door please do not speak about nevilles parents to anybody else he has the right to let people know when he is readyyes professor said harry turning to goandharry looked back dumbledore was standing over the pensieve his face lit from beneath by its silvery spots of light looking older than ever he stared at harry for a moment and then said good luck with the third taskchapter thirtyone the third taskdumbledore reckons youknowwhos getting stronger again as well ron whisperedeverything harry had seen in the pensieve nearly everything dumbledore had told and shown him afterward he had now shared with ron and hermione and of course with sirius to whom harry had sent an owl the moment he had left dumbledores office harry ron and hermione sat up late in the common room once again that night talking it all over until harrys mind was reeling until he understood what dumbledore had meant about a head becoming so full of thoughts that it would have been a relief to siphon them offron stared into the common room fire harry thought he saw ron shiver slightly even though the evening was warmand he trusts snape ron said he really trusts snape even though he knows he was a death eateryes said harryhermione had not spoken for ten minutes she was sitting with her forehead in her hands staring at her knees harry thought she too looked as though she could have done with a pensieverita skeeter she muttered finallyhow can you be worrying about her now said ron in utter disbeliefim not worrying about her hermione said to her knees im just thinking remember what she said to me in the three broomsticks i know things about ludo bagman that would make your hair curl this is what she meant isnt it she reported his trial she knew hed passed information to the death eaters and winky too remember ludo bagmans a bad wizard mr crouch would have been furious he got off he would have talked about it at homeyeah but bagman didnt pass information on purpose did hehermione shruggedand fudge reckons madame maxime attacked crouch ron said turning back to harryyeah said harry but hes only saying that because crouch disappeared near the beauxbatons carriagewe never thought of her did we said ron slowly mind you shes definitely got giant blood and she doesnt want to admit itof course she doesnt said hermione sharply looking up look what happened to hagrid when rita found out about his mother look at fudge jumping to conclusions about her just because shes part giant who needs that sort of prejudice id probably say i had big bones if i knew thats what id get for telling the truthhermione looked at her watch we havent done any practicing she said looking shocked we were going to do the impediment curse well have to really get down to it tomorrow come on harry you need to get some sleepharry and ron went slowly upstairs to their dormitory as harry pulled on his pajamas he looked over at nevilles bed true to his word to dumbledore he had not told ron and hermione about neville s parents as harry took off his glasses and climbed into his fourposter he imagined how it must feel to have parents still living but unable to recognize you he often got sympathy from strangers for being an orphan but as he listened to nevilles snores he thought that neville deserved it more than he did lying in the darkness harry felt a rush of anger and hate toward the people who had tortured mr and mrs longbottom he remembered the jeers of the crowd as crouchs son and his companions had been dragged from the court by the dementors he understood how they had felt then he remembered the milkwhite face of the screaming boy and realized with a jolt that he had died a year later it was voldemort harry thought staring up at the canopy of his bed in the darkness it all came back to voldemort he was the one who had torn these families apart who had ruined all these lives ron and hermione were supposed to be studying for their exams which would finish on the day of the third task but they were putting most of their efforts into helping harry preparedont worry about it hermione said shortly when harry pointed this out to them and said he didnt mind practicing on his own for a while at least well get top marks in defense against the dark arts wed never have found out about all these hexes in classgood training for when were all aurors said ron excitedly attempting the impediment curse on a wasp that had buzzed into the room and making it stop dead in midairthe mood in the castle as they entered june became excited and tense again everyone was looking forward to the third task which would take place a week before the end of term harry was practicing hexes at every available moment he felt more confident about this task than either of the others difficult and dangerous though it would undoubtedly be moody was right harry had managed to find his way past monstrous creatures and enchanted barriers before now and this time he had some notice some chance to prepare himself for what lay aheadtired of walking in on harry hermione and ron all over the school professor mcgonagall had given them permission to use the empty transfiguration classroom at lunchtimes harry had soon mastered the impediment curse a spell to slow down and obstruct attackers the reductor curse which would enable him to blast solid objects out of his way and the fourpoint spell a useful discovery of hermiones that would make his wand point due north therefore enabling him to check whether he was going in the right direction within the maze he was still having trouble with the shield charm though this was supposed to cast a temporary invisible wall around himself that deflected minor curses hermione managed to shatter it with a wellplaced jellylegs jinx and harry wobbled around the room for ten minutes afterward before she had looked up the counterjinxyoure still doing really well though hermione said encouragingly looking down her list and crossing off those spells they had already learned some of these are bound to come in handycome and look at this said ron who was standing by the window he was staring down onto the grounds whats malfoy doingharry and hermione went to see malfoy crabbe and goyle were standing in the shadow of a tree below crabbe and goyle seemed to be keeping a lookout both were smirking malfoy was holding his hand up to his mouth and speaking into ithe looks like hes using a walkietalkie said harry curiouslyhe cant be said hermione ive told you those sorts of things dont work around hogwarts come on harry she added briskly turning away from the window and moving back into the middle of the room lets try that shield charm againsirius was sending daily owls now like hermione he seemed to want to concentrate on getting harry through the last task before they concerned themselves with anything else he reminded harry in every letter that whatever might be going on outside the walls of hogwarts was not harrys responsibility nor was it within his power to influence itif voldemort is really getting stronger again he wrote my priority is to ensure your safety he cannot hope to lay hands on you while you are under dumbledores protection but all the same take no risks concentrate on getting through that maze safely and then we can turn our attention to other mattersharrys nerves mounted as june the twentyfourth drew closer but they were not as bad as those he had felt before the first and second tasks for one thing he was confident that this time he had done everything in his power to prepare for the task for another this was the final hurdle and however well or badly he did the tournament would at last be over which would be an enormous reliefbreakfast was a very noisy affair at the gryffindor table on the morning of the third task the post owls appeared bringing harry a goodluck card from sirius it was only a piece of parchment folded over and bearing a muddy paw print on its front but harry appreciated it all the same a screech owl arrived for hermione carrying her morning copy of the daily prophet as usual she unfolded the paper glanced at the front page and spat out a mouthful of pumpkin juice all over itwhat said harry and ron together staring at her nothing said hermione quickly trying to shove the paper out of sight but ron grabbed it he stared at the headline and said no way not today that old cowwhat said harry rita skeeter again no said ron and just like hermione he attempted to push the paper out of sightits about me isnt it said harry no said ron in an entirely unconvincing tone but before harry could demand to see the paper draco malfoy shouted across the great hall from the slytherin tablehey potter potter hows your head you feeling all right sure youre not going to go berserk on usmalfoy was holding a copy of the daily prophet too slytherins up and down the table were sniggering twisting in their seats to see harrys reactionlet me see it harry said to ron give it here very reluctantly ron handed over the newspaper harry turned it over and found himself staring at his own picture beneath the banner headlineharry potter disturbed and dangerousthe boy who defeated hewhomustnotbenamed is unstable and possibly dangerous writes rita skeeter special correspondent alarming evidence has recently come to light about harry potters strange behavior which casts doubts upon his suitability to compete in a demanding competition like the triwizard tournament or even to attend hogwarts schoolpotter the daily prophet can exclusively reveal regularly collapses at school and is often heard to complain of pain in the scar on his forehead relic of the curse with which youknowwho attempted to kill him on monday last midway through a divination lesson your daily prophet reporter witnessed potter storming from the class claiming that his scar was hurting too badly to continue studyingit is possible say top experts at st mungos hospital for magical maladies and injuries that potters brain was affected by the attack inflicted upon him by youknowwho and that his insistence that the scar is still hurting is an expression of his deepseated confusionhe might even be pretending said one specialist this could be a plea for attentionthe daily prophet however has unearthed worrying facts about harry potter that albus dumbledore headmaster of hogwarts has carefully concealed from the wizarding publicpotter can speak parseltongue reveals draco malfoy a hogwarts fourth year there were a lot of attacks on students a couple of years ago and most people thought potter was behind them after they saw him lose his temper at a dueling club and set a snake on another boy it was all hushed up though but hes made friends with werewolves and giants too we think hed do anything for a bit of powerparseltongue the ability to converse with snakes has long been considered a dark art indeed the most famous parselmouth of our times is none other than youknowwho himself a member of the dark force defense league who wished to remain unnamed stated that he would regard any wizard who could speak parseltongue as worthy of investigation personally i would be highly suspicious of anybody who could converse with snakes as serpents are often used in the worst kinds of dark magic and are historically associated with evildoers similarly anyone who seeks out the company of such vicious creatures as werewolves and giants would appear to have a fondness for violencealbus dumbledore should surely consider whether a boy such as this should be allowed to compete in the triwizard

the side chamber and entered krum slouched off to join them shortly afterward harry stayed where he was he really didnt want to go into the chamber he had no family no family who would turn up to see him risk his life anyway but just as he was getting up thinking that he might as well go up to the library and do a spot more hex research the door of the side chamber opened and cedric stuck his head outharry come on theyre waiting for youutterly perplexed harry got up the dursleys couldnt possibly be here could they he walked across the hall and opened the door into the chambercedric and his parents were just inside the door viktor krum was over in a corner conversing with his darkhaired mother and father in rapid bulgarian he had inherited his fathers hooked nose on the other side of the room fleur was jabbering away in french to her mother fleurs little sister gabrielle was holding her mothers hand she waved at harry who waved back grinning then he saw mrs weasley and bill standing in front of the fireplace beaming at himsurprise mrs weasley said excitedly as he smiled broadly and walked over to them thought wed come and watch you harry she bent down and kissed him on the cheekyou all right said bill grinning at harry and shaking his hand charlie wanted to come but he couldnt get time off he said you were incredible against the horntailfleur delacour harry noticed was

said angrily i would have thought youd know that working at the ministrymr diggory looked as though he was going to say something angry but his wife laid a hand on his arm and he merely shrugged and turned awayharry had a very enjoyable morning walking over the sunny grounds with bill and mrs weasley showing them the beauxbatons carriage and the durmstrang ship mrs weasley was intrigued by the whomping willow which had been planted after she had left school and reminisced at length about the gamekeeper before hagrid a man called ogghows percy harry asked as they walked around the greenhousesnot good said billhes very upset said mrs weasley lowering her voice and glancing around the ministry wants to keep mr crouchs disappearance quiet but percys been hauled in for questioning

so i invented a few its all right he said helping himself to a cornish pasty while mrs weasley looked stern theyre all called stuff like bodrod the bearded and urg the unclean it wasnt hardfred george and ginny came to sit next to them too and harry was having such a good time he felt almost as though he were back at the burrow he had forgotten to worry about that evenings task and not until hermione turned up halfway through lunch did he remember that she had had a brainwave about rita skeeterare you going to tell us hermione shook her head warningly and glanced at mrs weasleyhello hermione said mrs weasley much more stiffly than usualhello said hermione her smile faltering at the cold expression on mrs weasleys faceharry looked between them then said mrs weasley you didnt believe that rubbish rita skeeter wrote in witch weekly did you because hermiones not my girlfriendoh said mrs weasley no of course i didntbut she became considerably warmer toward hermione after thatharry bill and mrs weasley whiled away the afternoon with a long walk around the castle and then returned to the great hall for the evening feast ludo bagman and cornelius fudge had joined the staff table now bagman looked quite cheerful but cornelius fudge who was sitting next to madame maxime looked stern and was not talking madame maxime was concentrating on her plate and harry thought her eyes looked red hagrid kept glancing along the table at herthere were more courses than usual but harry who was starting to feel really nervous now didnt eat much as the enchanted ceiling overhead began to fade from blue to a dusky purple dumbledore rose to his feet at the staff table and silence fellladies and gentlemen in five minutes time i will be asking you to make your way down to the quidditch field for the third and final task of the triwizard tournament will the champions please follow mr bagman down to the stadium nowharry got up the gryffindors all along the table were applauding him the weasleys and hermione all wished him good luck and he headed off out of the great hall with cedric fleur and viktorfeeling all right harry bagman asked as they went down the stone steps onto the grounds confidentim okay said harry it was sort of true he was nervous but he kept running over all the hexes and spells he had been practicing in his mind as they walked and the knowledge that he could remember them all made him feel betterthey walked onto the quidditch field which was now completely unrecognizable a twentyfoothigh hedge ran all the way around the edge of it there was a gap right in front of them the entrance to the vast maze the passage beyond it looked dark and creepyfive minutes later the stands had begun to fill the air was full of excited voices and the rumbling of feet as the hundreds of students filed into their seats the sky was a deep clear blue now and the first stars were starting to appear hagrid professor moody professor mcgonagall and professor flitwick came walking into the stadium and approached bagman and the champions they were wearing large red luminous stars on their hats all except hagrid who had his on the back of his moleskin vestwe are going to be patrolling the outside of the maze said professor mcgonagall to the champions if you get into difficulty and wish to be rescued send red sparks into the air and one of us will come and get you do you understandthe champions noddedoff you go then said bagman brightly to the four patrollersgood luck harry hagrid whispered and the four of them walked away in different directions to station themselves around the maze bagman now pointed his wand at his throat muttered sonorus and his magically magnified voice echoed into the standsladies and gentlemen the third and final task of the triwizard tournament is about to begin let me remind you how the points currently stand tied in first place with eightyfive points each mr cedric diggory and mr harry potter both of hogwarts school the cheers and applause sent birds from the forbidden forest fluttering into the darkening sky in second place with eighty points mr viktor krum of durmstrang institute more applause and in third place miss fleur delacour of beauxbatons academyharry could just make out mrs weasley bill ron and hermione applauding fleur politely halfway up the stands he waved up at them and they waved back beaming at himso on my whistle harry and cedric said bagman three two one he gave a short blast on his whistle and harry and cedric hurried forward into the mazethe towering hedges cast black shadows across the path and whether because they were so tall and thick or because they had been enchanted the sound of the surrounding crowd was silenced the moment they entered the maze harry felt almost as though he were underwater again he pulled out his wand muttered lumos and heard cedric do the same just behind himafter about fifty yards they reached a fork they looked at each othersee you harry said and he took the left one while cedric took the rightharry heard bagmans whistle for the second time krum had entered the maze harry sped up his chosen path seemed completely deserted he turned right and hurried on holding his wand high over his head trying to see as far ahead as possible still there was nothing in sightbagmans whistle blew in the distance for the third time all of the champions were now insideharry kept looking behind him the old feeling that he was being watched was upon him the maze was growing darker with every passing minute as the sky overhead deepened to navy he reached a second forkpoint me he whispered to his wand holding it flat in his palmthe wand spun around once and pointed toward his right into solid hedge that way was north and he knew that he needed to go northwest for the center of the maze the best he could do was to take the left fork and go right again as soon as possiblethe path ahead was empty too and when harry reached a right turn and took it he again found his way unblocked harry didnt know why but the lack of obstacles was unnerving him surely he should have met something by now it felt as though the maze were luring him into a false sense of security then he heard movement right behind him he held out his wand ready to attack but its beam fell only upon cedric who had just hurried out of a path on the righthand side cedric looked severely shaken the sleeve of his robe was smokinghagrids blastended skrewts he hissed theyre enormous i only just got awayhe shook his head and dived out of sight along another path keen to put plenty of distance between himself and the skrewts harry hurried off again then as he turned a corner he saw a dementor gliding toward him twelve feet tall its face hidden by its hood its rotting scabbed hands outstretched it advanced sensing its way blindly toward him harry could hear its rattling breath he felt clammy coldness stealing over him but knew what he had to dohe summoned the happiest thought he could concentrated with all his might on the thought of getting out of the maze and celebrating with ron and hermione raised his wand and cried expecto patronuma silver stag erupted from the end of harrys wand and galloped toward the dementor which fell back and tripped over the hem of its robes harry had never seen a dementor stumblehang on he shouted advancing in the wake of his silver patronus youre a boggart riddikulusthere was a loud crack and the shapeshifter exploded in a wisp of smoke the silver stag faded from sight harry wished it could have stayed he could have used some companybut he moved on quickly and quietly as possible listening hard his wand held high once moreleft right left again twice he found himself facing dead ends he did the fourpoint spell again and found that he was going too far east he turned back took a right turn and saw an odd golden mist floating ahead of himharry approached it cautiously pointing the wands beam at it this looked like some kind of enchantment he wondered whether he might be able to blast it out of the wayreducio he saidthe spell shot straight through the mist leaving it intact he supposed he should have known better the reductor curse was for solid objects what would happen if he walked through the mist was it worth chancing it or should he double backhe was still hesitating when a scream shattered the silencefleur harry yelledthere was silence he stared all around him what had happened to her her scream seemed to have come from somewhere ahead he took a deep breath and ran through the enchanted mistthe world turned upside down harry was hanging from the ground with his hair on end his glasses dangling off his nose threatening to fall into the bottomless sky he clutched them to the end of his nose and hung there terrified it felt as though his feet were glued to the grass which had now become the ceiling below him the dark starspangled heavens stretched endlessly he felt as though if he tried to move one of his feet he would fall away from the earth completelythink he told himself as all the blood rushed to his head think but not one of the spells he had practiced had been designed to combat a sudden reversal of ground and sky did he dare move his foot he could hear the blood pounding in his ears he had two choices try and move or send up red sparks and get rescued and disqualified from the taskhe shut his eyes so he wouldnt be able to see the view of endless space below him and pulled his right foot as hard as he could away from the grassy ceilingimmediately the world righted itself harry fell forward onto his knees onto the wonderfully solid ground he felt temporarily limp with shock he took a deep steadying breath then got up again and hurried forward looking back over his shoulder as he ran away from the golden mist which twinkled innocently at him in the moonlighthe paused at a junction of two paths and looked around for some sign of fleur he was sure it had been she who had screamed what had she met was she all right there was no sign of red sparks did that mean she had got herself out of trouble or was she in such trouble that she couldnt reach her wand harry took the right fork with a feeling of increasing unease but at the same time he couldnt help thinking one champion down the cup was somewhere close by and it sounded as though fleur was no longer in the running hed got this far hadnt he what if he actually managed to win fleetingly and for the first time since hed found himself champion he saw again that image of himself raising the triwizard cup in front of the rest of the school he met nothing for ten minutes but kept running into dead ends twice he took the same wrong turning finally he found a new route and started to jog along it his wandlight waving making his shadow flicker and distort on the hedge walls then he rounded another corner and found himself facing a blastended skrewtcedric was right it was enormous ten feet long it looked more like a giant scorpion than anything its long sting was curled over its back its thick armor glinted in the light from harrys wand which he pointed at itstupefythe spell hit the skrewts armor and rebounded harry ducked just in time but could smell burning hair it had singed the top of his head the skrewt issued a blast of fire from its end and flew forward toward himimpedimenta harry yelled the spell hit the skrewts armor again and ricocheted off harry staggered back a few paces and fell over impedimentathe skrewt was inches from him when it froze he had managed to hit it on its fleshy shellless underside panting harry pushed himself away from it and ran hard in the opposite direction the impediment curse was not permanent the skrewt would be regaining the use of its legs at any momenthe took a left path and hit a dead end a right and hit another forcing himself to stop heart hammering he performed the fourpoint spell again backtracked and chose a path that would take him northwesthe had been hurrying along the new path for a few minutes when he heard something in the path running parallel to his own that made him stop deadwhat are you doing yelled cedrics voice what the hell dyou think youre doingand then harry heard krums voicecruciothe air was suddenly full of cedrics yells horrified harry began sprinting up his path trying to find a way into cedrics when none appeared he tried the reductor curse again it wasnt very effective but it burned a small hole in the hedge through which harry forced his leg kicking at the thick brambles and branches until they broke and made an opening he struggled through it tearing his robes and looking to his right saw cedric jerking and twitching on the ground krum standing over himharry pulled himself up and pointed his wand at krum just as krum looked up krum turned and began to runstupefy harry yelledthe spell hit krum in the back he stopped dead in his tracks fell forward and lay motionless facedown in the grass harrydashed over to cedric who had stopped twitching and was lying there panting his hands over his faceare you all right harry said roughly grabbing cedrics armyeah panted cedric yeah i dont believe it he crept up behind me i heard him i turned around and he had his wand on me cedric got up he was still shaking he and harry looked down at krumi cant believe this i thought he was all right harry said staring at krumso did i said cedricdid you hear fleur scream earlier said harryyeah said cedric you dont think krum got her tooi dont know said harry slowlyshould we leave him here cedric mutteredno said harry i reckon we should send up red sparks someonell come and collect him otherwise hell probably be eaten by a skrewthed deserve it cedric muttered but all the same he raised his wand and shot a shower of red sparks into the air which hovered high above krum marking the spot where he layharry and cedric stood there in the darkness for a moment looking around them then cedric said well i spose wed better go on what said harry oh yeah right it was an odd moment he and cedric had been briefly united against krum now the fact that they were opponents came back to harry the two of them proceeded up the dark path without speaking then harry turned left and cedric right cedrics footsteps soon died awayharry moved on continuing to use the fourpoint spell making sure he was moving in the right direction it was between him and cedric now his desire to reach the cup first was now burning stronger than ever but he could hardly believe what hed just seen krum do the use of an unforgivable curse on a fellow human being meant a life term in azkaban that was what moody had told them krum surely couldnt have wanted the triwizard cup that badlyharry sped upevery so often he hit more dead ends but the increasing darkness made him feel sure he was getting near the heart of the maze then as he strode down a long straight path he saw movement once again and his beam of wandlight hit an extraordinary creature one which he had only seen in picture form in his monster book of monstersit was a sphinx it had the body of an overlarge lion great clawed paws and a long yellowish tail ending in a brown tuft its head however was that of a woman she turned her long almondshaped eyes upon harry as he approached he raised his wand hesitating she was not crouching as if to spring but pacing from side to side of the path blocking his progress then she spoke in a deep hoarse voiceyou are very near your goal the quickest way is past meso so will you move please said harry knowing what the answer was going to beno she said continuing to pace not unless you can answer my riddle answer on your first guess i let you pass answer wrongly i attack remain silent i will let you walk away from me unscathedharrys stomach slipped several notches it was hermione who was good at this sort of thing not him he weighed his chances if the riddle was too hard he could keep silent get away from the sphinx unharmed and try and find an alternative route to the centerokay he said can i hear the riddlethe sphinx sat down upon her hind legs in the very middle of the path and recitedfirst think of the person who lives in disguisewho deals in secrets and tells naught but liesnext tell me whats always the last thing to mendthe middle of middle and end of the endand finally give me the sound often heardduring the search for a hardtofind wordnow string them together and answer me thiswhich creature would you be unwilling to kissharry gaped at hercould i have it again more slowly he asked tentatively she blinked at him smiled and repeated the poem all the clues add up to a creature i wouldnt want to kiss harry askedshe merely smiled her mysterious smile harry took that for a yes harry cast his mind around there were plenty of animals he wouldnt want to kiss his immediate thought was a blastended skrewt but something told him that wasnt the answer hed have to try and work out the clues a person in disguise harry muttered staring at her who lies er thatd be a an impostor no thats not my guess a a spy ill come back to that could you give me the next clue again pleaseshe repeated the next lines of the poemthe last thing to mend harry repeated er no idea middle of middle could i have the last bit againshe gave him the last four linesthe sound often heard during the search for a hardtofind word said harry er thatd be er hang on er ers a soundthe sphinx smiled at himspy er spy er said harry pacing up and down a creature i wouldnt want to kiss a spiderthe sphinx smiled more broadly she got up stretched her front legs and then moved aside for him to passthanks said harry and amazed at his own brilliance he dashed forwardhe had to be close now he had to be his wand was telling him he was bang on course as long as he didnt meet anything too horrible he might have a chance harry broke into a run he had a choice of paths up ahead point me he whispered again to his wand and it spun around and pointed him to the righthand one he dashed up this one and saw light aheadthe triwizard cup was gleaming on a plinth a hundred yards away suddenly a dark figure hurtled out onto the path in front of himcedric was going to get there first cedric was sprinting as fast as he could toward the cup and harry knew he would never catch up cedric was much taller had much longer legs then harry saw something immense over a hedge to his left moving quickly along a path that intersected with his own it was moving so fast cedric was about to run into it and cedric his eyes on the cup had not seen it cedric harry bellowed on your leftcedric looked around just in time to hurl himself past the thing and avoid colliding with it but in his haste he tripped harry saw cedrics wand fly out of his hand as a gigantic spider stepped into the path and began to bear down upon cedricstupefy harry yelled the spell hit the spiders gigantic hairy black body but for all the good it did he might as well have thrown a stone at it the spider jerked scuttled around and ran at harry insteadstupefy impedimenta stupefybut it was no use the spider was either so large or so magical that the spells were doing no more than aggravating it harry had one horrifying glimpse of eight shining black eyes and razorsharp pincers before it was upon himhe was lifted into the air in its front legs struggling madly he tried to kick it his leg connected with the pincers and next moment he was in excruciating pain he could hear cedric yelling stupefy too but his spell had no more effect than harrys harry raised his wand as the spider opened its pincers once more and shouted expelliarmusit worked the disarming spell made the spider drop him but that meant that harry fell twelve feet onto his already injured leg which crumpled beneath him without pausing to think he aimed high at the spiders underbelly as he had done with the skrewt and shouted stupefyjust as cedric yelled the same thingthe two spells combined did what one alone had not the spider keeled over sideways flattening a nearby hedge and strewing the path with a tangle of hairy legsharry he heard cedric shouting you all right did it fall on youno harry called back panting he looked down at his leg it was bleeding freely he could see some sort of thick gluey secretion from the spiders pincers on his torn robes he tried to get up but his leg was shaking badly and did not want to support his weight he leaned against the hedge gasping for breath and looked aroundcedric was standing feet from the triwizard cup which was gleaming behind himtake it then harry panted to cedric go on take it youre therebut cedric didnt move he merely stood there looking at harry then he turned to stare at the cup harry saw the longing expression on his face in its golden light cedric looked around at harry again who was now holding onto the hedge to support himself cedric took a deep breathyou take it you should win thats twice youve saved my neck in herethats not how its supposed to work harry said he felt angry his leg was very painful he was aching all over from trying to throw off the spider and after all his efforts cedric had beaten him to it just as hed beaten harry to ask cho to the ball the one who reaches the cup first gets the points thats you im telling you im not going to win any races on this legcedric took a few paces nearer to the stunned spider away from the cup shaking his headno he saidstop being noble said harry irritably just take it then we can get out of herecedric watched harry steadying himself holding tight to the hedgeyou told me about the dragons cedric said i wouldve gone down in the first task if you hadnt told me what was comingi had help on that too harry snapped trying to mop up his bloody leg with his robes you helped me with the egg were squarei had help on the egg in the first place said cedricwere still square said harry testing his leg gingerly it shook violently as he put weight on it he had sprained his ankle when the spider had dropped himyou shouldve got more points on the second task said cedric mulishly you stayed behind to get all the hostages i shouldve done thati was the only one who was thick enough to take that song seriously said harry bitterly just take the cupno said cedriche stepped over the spiders tangled legs to join harry who stared at him cedric was serious he was walking away from the sort of glory hufflepuff house hadnt had in centuriesgo on cedric said he looked as though this was costing him every ounce of resolution he had but his face was set his arms were folded he seemed decidedharry looked from cedric to the cup for one shining moment he saw himself emerging from the maze holding it he saw himself holding the triwizard cup aloft heard the roar of the crowd saw chos face shining with admiration more clearly than he had ever seen it before and then the picture faded and he found himself staring at cedrics shadowy stubborn faceboth of us harry saidwhatwell take it at the same time its still a hogwarts victory well tie for itcedric stared at harry he unfolded his armsyou you sureyeah said harry yeah weve helped each other out havent we we both got here lets just take it togetherfor a moment cedric looked as though he couldnt believe his ears then his face split in a grinyoure on he said come herehe grabbed harrys arm below the shoulder and helped harry limp toward the plinth where the cup stood when they had reached it they both held a hand out over one of the cups gleaming handleson three right said harry one two three he and cedric both grasped a handleinstantly harry felt a jerk somewhere behind his navel his feet had left the ground he could not unclench the hand holding the triwizard cup it was pulling him onward in a howl of wind and swirling color cedric at his sidechapter thirtytwo flesh blood and boneharry felt his feet slam into the ground his injured leg gave way and he fell forward his hand let go of the triwizard cup at last he raised his headwhere are we he saidcedric shook his head he got up pulled harry to his feet and they looked aroundthey had left the hogwarts grounds completely they had obviously traveled miles perhaps hundreds of miles for even the mountains surrounding the castle were gone they were standing instead in a dark and overgrown graveyard the black outline of a small church was visible beyond a large yew tree to their right a hill rose above them to their left harry could just make out the outline of a fine old house on the hillsidecedric looked down at the triwizard cup and then up at harrydid anyone tell you the cup was a portkey he askednope said harry he was looking around the graveyard it was completely silent and slightly eerie is this supposed to be part of the taski dunno said cedric he sounded slightly nervous wands out dyou reckonyeah said harry glad that cedric had made the suggestion rather than himthey pulled out their wands harry kept looking around him he had yet again the strange feeling that they were being watchedsomeones coming he said suddenlysquinting tensely through the darkness they watched the figure drawing nearer walking steadily toward them between the graves harry couldnt make out a face but from the way it was walking and holding its arms he could tell that it was carrying something whoever it was he was short and wearing a hooded cloak pulled up over his head to obscure his face and several paces nearer the gap between them closing all the time harry saw that the thing in the persons arms looked like a baby or was it merely a bundle of robesharry lowered his wand slightly and glanced sideways at cedric cedric shot him a quizzical look they both turned back to watch the approaching figureit stopped beside a towering marble headstone only six feet from them for a second harry and cedric and the short figure simply looked at one anotherand then without warning harrys scar exploded with pain it was agony such as he had never felt in all his life his wand slipped from his fingers as he put his hands over his face his knees buckled he was on the ground and he could see nothing at all his head was about to split openfrom far away above his head he heard a high cold voice say kill the sparea swishing noise and a second voice which screeched the words to the night avada kedavraa blast of green light blazed through harrys eyelids and he heard something heavy fall to the ground beside him the pain in his scar reached such a pitch that he retched and then it diminished terrified of what he was about to see he opened his stinging eyescedric was lying spreadeagled on the ground beside him he was deadfor a second that contained an eternity harry stared into cedrics face at his open gray eyes blank and expressionless as the windows of a deserted house at his halfopen mouth which looked slightly surprised and then before harrys mind had accepted what he was seeing before he could feel anything but numb disbelief he felt himself being pulled to his feetthe short man in the cloak had put down his bundle lit his wand and was dragging harry toward the marble headstone harry saw the name upon it flickering in the wandlight before he was forced around and slammed against ittom riddlethe cloaked man was now conjuring tight cords around harry tying him from neck to ankles to the headstone harry could hear shallow fast breathing from the depths of the hood he struggled and the man hit him hit him with a hand that had a finger missing and harry realized who was under the hood it was wormtailyou he gaspedbut wormtail who had finished conjuring the ropes did not reply he was busy checking the tightness of the cords his fingers trembling uncontrollably rumbling over the knots once sure that harry was bound so tightly to the headstone that he couldnt move an inch wormtail drew a length of some black material from the inside of his cloak and stuffed it roughly into harrys mouth then without a word he turned from harry and hurried away harry couldnt make a sound nor could he see where wormtail had gone he couldnt turn his head to see beyond the headstone he could see only what was right in front of himcedrics body was lying some twenty feet away some way beyond him glinting in the starlight lay the triwizard cup harrys wand was on the ground at cedrics feet the bundle of robes that harry had thought was a baby was close by at the foot of the grave it seemed to be stirring fretfully harry watched it and his scar seared with pain again and he suddenly knew that he didnt want to see what was in those robes he didnt want that bundle openedhe could hear noises at his feet he looked down and saw a gigantic snake slithering through the grass circling the headstone where he was tied wormtails fast wheezy breathing was growing louder again it sounded as though he was forcing something heavy across the ground then he came back within harrys range of vision and harry saw him pushing a stone cauldron to the foot of the grave it was full of what seemed to be water harry could hear it slopping around and it was larger than any cauldron harry had ever used a great stone belly large enough for a fullgrown man to sit inthe thing inside the bundle of robes on the ground was stirring more persistently as though it was trying to free itself now wormtail was busying himself at the bottom of the cauldron with a wand suddenly there were crackling names beneath it the large snake slithered away into the darknessthe liquid in the cauldron seemed to heat very fast the surface began not only to bubble but to send out fiery sparks as though it were on fire steam was thickening blurring the outline of wormtail tending the fire the movements beneath the robes became more agitated and harry heard the high cold voice againhurrythe whole surface of the water was alight with sparks now it might have been encrusted with diamondsit is ready masternow said the cold voicewormtail pulled open the robes on the ground revealing what was inside them and harry let out a yell that was strangled in the wad of material blocking his mouthit was as though wormtail had flipped over a stone and revealed something ugly slimy and blind but worse a hundred times worse the thing wormtail had been carrying had the shape of a crouched human child except that harry had never seen anything less like a child it was hairless and scalylooking a dark raw reddish black its arms and legs were thin and feeble and its face no child alive ever had a face like that flat and snakelike with gleaming red eyesthe thing seemed almost helpless it raised its thin arms put them around wormtails neck and wormtail lifted it as he did so his hood fell back and harry saw the look of revulsion on wormtails weak pale face in the firelight as he carried the creature to the rim of the cauldron for one moment harry saw the evil flat face illuminated in the sparks dancing on the surface of the potion and then wormtail lowered the creature into the cauldron there was a hiss and it vanished below the surface harry heard its frail body hit the bottom with a soft thudlet it drown harry thought his scar burning almost past endurance please let it drown wormtail was speaking his voice shook he seemed frightened beyond his wits he raised his wand closed his eyes and spoke to the nightbone of the father unknowingly given you wil lrenew your sonthe surface of the grave at harrys feet cracked horrified harry watched as a fine trickle of dust rose into the air at wormtails command and fell softly into the cauldron the diamond surface of the water broke and hissed it sent sparks in all directions and turned a vivid poisonouslooking blueand now wormtail was whimpering he pulled a long thin shining silver dagger from inside his cloak his voice broke into petrified sobsflesh of the servant wwillingly given you will revive your master he stretched his right hand out in front of him the hand with the missing finger he gripped the dagger very tightly in his left hand and swung it upwardharry realized what wormtail was about to do a second before it happened he closed his eyes as tightly as he could but he could not block the scream that pierced the night that went through harry as though he had been stabbed with the dagger too he heard something fall to the ground heard wormtails anguished panting then a sickening splash as something was dropped into the cauldron harry couldnt stand to look but the potion had turned a burning red the light of it shone through harrys closed eyelids wormtail was gasping and moaning with agony not until harry felt wormtails anguished breath on his face did he realize that wormtail was right in front of himbblood of the enemy forcibly taken you will resurrect your foeharry could do nothing to prevent it he was tied too tightly squinting down struggling hopelessly at the ropes binding him he saw the shining silver dagger shaking in wormtails remaining hand he felt its point penetrate the crook of his right arm and blood seeping down the sleeve of his torn robes wormtail still panting with pain rumbled in his pocket for a glass vial and held it to harrys cut so that a dribble of blood fell into ithe staggered back to the cauldron with harrys blood he poured it inside the liquid within turned instantly a blinding white wormtail his job done dropped to his knees beside the cauldron then slumped sideways and lay on the ground cradling the bleeding stump of his arm gasping and sobbingthe cauldron was simmering sending its diamond sparks in all directions so blindingly bright that it turned all else to velvety blackness nothing happened let it have drowned harry thought let it have gone wrong Ã¯Â¿Â½and then suddenly the sparks emanating from the cauldron were extinguished a surge of white steam billowed thickly from the cauldron instead obliterating everything in front of harry so that he couldnt see wormtail or cedric or anything but vapor hanging in the air its gone wrong he thought its drowned please please let it be dead but then through the mist in front of him he saw with an icy surge of terror the dark outline of a man tall and skeletally thin rising slowly from inside the cauldronrobe me said the high cold voice from behind the steam and wormtail sobbing and moaning still cradling his mutilated arm scrambled to pick up the black robes from the ground got to his feet reached up and pulled them onehanded over his masters headthe thin man stepped out of the cauldron staring at harry and harry stared back into the face that had haunted his nightmares for three years whiter than a skull with wide livid scarlet eyes and a nose that was flat as a snakes with slits for nostrils lord voldemort had risen againchapter thirtythree the death eatersvoldemort looked away from harry and began examining his own body his hands were like large pale spiders his long white fingers caressed his own chest his arms his face the red eyes whose pupils were slits like a cats gleamed still more brightly through the darkness he held up his hands and flexed the fingers his expression rapt and exultant he took not the slightest notice of wormtail who lay twitching and bleeding on the ground nor of the great snake which had slithered back into sight and was circling harry again hissing voldemort slipped one of those unnaturally longfingered hands into a deep pocket and drew out a wand he caressed it gently too and then he raised it and pointed it at wormtail who was lifted off the ground and thrown against the headstone where harry was tied he fell to the foot of it and lay there crumpled up and crying voldemort turned his scarlet eyes upon harry laughing a high cold mirthless laughwormtails robes were shining with blood now he had wrapped the stump of his arm in themmy lord he choked my lord you promised you did promise hold out your arm said voldemort lazilyoh master thank you master he extended the bleeding stump but voldemort laughed againthe other arm wormtailmaster please please voldemort bent down and pulled out wormtails left arm he forced the sleeve of wormtails robes up past his elbow and harry saw something upon the skin there something like a vivid red tattoo a skull with a snake protruding from its mouth the image that had appeared in the sky at the quidditch world cup the dark mark voldemort examined it carefully ignoring wormtails uncontrollable weepingit is back he said softly they will all have noticed it and now we shall see now we shall know he pressed his long white forefinger to the brand on wormtails armthe scar on harry s forehead seared with a sharp pain again and wormtail let out a fresh howl voldemort removed his fingers from wormtails mark and harry saw that it had turned jet blacka look of cruel satisfaction on his face voldemort straightened up threw back his head and stared around at the dark graveyardhow many will be brave enough to return when they feel it he whispered his gleaming red eyes fixed upon the stars and how many will be foolish enough to stay awayhe began to pace up and down before harry and wormtail eyes sweeping the graveyard all the while after a minute or so he looked down at harry again a cruel smile twisting his snakelike faceyou stand harry potter upon the remains of my late father he hissed softly a muggle and a fool very like your dear mother but they both had their uses did they not your mother died to defend you as a child and i killed my father and see how useful he has proved himself in death voldemort laughed again up and down he paced looking all around him as he walked and the snake continued to circle in the grassyou see that house upon the hillside potter my father lived there my mother a witch who lived here in this village fell in love with him but he abandoned her when she told him what she was he didnt like magic my father he left her and returned to his muggle parents before i was even born potter and she died giving birth to me leaving me to be raised in a muggle orphanage but i vowed to find him i revenged myself upon him that fool who gave me his name tom riddle still he paced his red eyes darting from grave to gravelisten to me reliving family history he said quietly why i am growing quite sentimental but look harry my true family returns the air was suddenly full of the swishing of cloaks between graves behind the yew tree in every shadowy space wizards were apparating all of them were hooded and masked and one by one they moved forward slowly cautiously as though they couldhardly believe their eyes voldemort stood in silence waiting for them then one of the death eaters fell to his knees crawled toward voldemort and kissed the hem of his black robesmaster master he murmuredthe death eaters behind him did the same each of them approaching voldemort on his knees and kissing his robes before backing away and standing up forming a silent circle which enclosed tom riddle s grave harry voldemort and the sobbing and twitching heap that was wormtail yet they left gaps in the circle as though waiting for more people voldemort however did not seem to expect more he looked around at the hooded faces and though there was no wind rustling seemed to run around the circle as though it had shiveredwelcome death eaters said voldemort quietly thirteen years thirteen years since last we met yet you answer my call as though it were yesterday we are still united under the dark mark then or are wehe put back his terrible face and sniffed his slitlike nostrils wideningi smell guilt he said there is a stench or guilt upon the aira second shiver ran around the circle as though each member of it longed but did not dare to step back from himi see you all whole and healthy with your powers intact such prompt appearances and i ask myself why did this band of wizards never come to the aid of their master to whom they swore eternal loyaltyno one spoke no one moved except wormtail who was upon the ground still sobbing over his bleeding arm and i answer myself whispered voldemort they must have believed me broken they thought i was gone they slipped back among my enemies and they pleaded innocence and ignorance and bewitchment and then i ask myself but how could they have believed i would not rise again they who knew the steps i took long ago to guard myself against mortal death they who had seen proofs of the immensity of my power in the times when i was mightier than any wizard livingand i answer myself perhaps they believed a still greater power could exist one that could vanquish even lord voldemort perhaps they now pay allegiance to another perhaps that champion of commoners of mudbloods and muggles albus dumbledoreat the mention of dumbledores name the members of the circle stirred and some muttered and shook their heads voldemort ignored themit is a disappointment to me i confess myself disappointed one of the men suddenly flung himself forward breaking the circle trembling from head to foot he collapsed at voldemorts feetmaster he shrieked master forgive me forgive us allvoldemort began to laugh he raised his wandcruciothe death eater on the ground writhed and shrieked harry was sure the sound must carry to the houses around let the police come he thought desperately anyone anything voldemort raised his wand the tortured death eater lay flat upon the ground gaspingget up avery said voldemort softly stand up you ask for forgiveness i do not forgive i do not forget thirteen long years i want thirteen years repayment before i forgive you wormtail here has paid some of his debt already have you not wormtailhe looked down at wormtail who continued to sobyou returned to me not out of loyalty but out of fear of your old friends you deserve this pain wormtail you know that dont youyes master moaned wormtail please master please yet you helped return me to my body said voldemort coolly watching wormtail sob on the ground worthless and traitorous as you are you helped me and lord voldemort rewards his helpers voldemort raised his wand again and whirled it through the air a streak of what looked like molten silver hung shining in the wands wake momentarily shapeless it writhed and then formed itself into a gleaming replica of a human hand bright as moonlight which soared downward and fixed itself upon wormtails bleeding wristwormtails sobbing stopped abruptly his breathing harsh and ragged he raised his head and stared in disbelief at the silver hand now attached seamlessly to his arm as though he were wearing a dazzling glove he flexed the shining fingers then trembling picked up a small twig on the ground and crushed it into powdermy lord he whispered master it is beautiful thank you thank you he scrambled forward on his knees and kissed the hem of voldemorts robesmay your loyalty never waver again wormtail said voldemortno my lord never my lord wormtail stood up and took his place in the circle staring at his powerful new hand his face still shining with tears voldemort now approached the man on wormtails rightlucius my slippery friend he whispered halting before him i am told that you have not renounced the old ways though to the world you present a respectable face you are still ready to take the lead in a spot of muggletorture i believe yet you never tried to find me lucius your exploits at the quidditch world cup were fun i daresay but might not your energies have been better directed toward finding and aiding your mastermy lord i was constantly on the alert came lucius malfoys voice swiftly from beneath the hood had there been any sign from you any whisper of your whereabouts i would have been at your side immediately nothing could have prevented me and yet you ran from my mark when a faithful death eater sent it into the sky last summer said voldemort lazily and mr malfoy stopped talking abruptly yes i know all about that lucius you have disappointed me i expect more faithful service in the futureof course my lord of course you are merciful thank you voldemort moved on and stopped staring at the space large enough for two people that separated malfoy and the next manthe lestranges should stand here said voldemort quietly but they are entombed in azkaban they were faithful they went to azkaban rather than renounce me when azkaban is broken open the lestranges will be honored beyond their dreams the dementors will join us they are our natural allies we will recall the banished giants i shall have all my devoted servants returned to me and an army of creatures whom all fear he walked on some of the death eaters he passed in silence but he paused before others and spoke to themmacnair destroying dangerous beasts for the ministry of magic now wormtail tells me you shall have better victims than that soon macnair lord voldemort will provide thank you master thank you murmured macnairand here voldemort moved on to the two largest hooded figures we have crabbe you will do better this time will you not crabbe and you goylethey bowed clumsily muttering dullyyes master we will masterthe same goes for you nott said voldemort quietly as he walked past a stooped figure in mr goyles shadowmy lord i prostrate myself before you i am your most faithful that will do said voldemorthe had reached the largest gap of all and he stood surveying it with his blank red eyes as though he could see people standing thereand here we have six missing death eaters three dead in my service one too cowardly to return he will pay one who i believe has left me forever he will be killed of course and one who remains my most faithful servant and who has already reentered my servicethe death eaters stirred and harry saw their eyes dart sideways at one another through their maskshe is at hogwarts that faithful servant and it was through his efforts that our young friend arrived here tonight yes said voldemort a grin curling his lipless mouth as the eyes of the circle flashed in harrys direction harry potter has kindly joined us for my rebirthing party one might go so far as to call him my guest of honorthere was a silence then the death eater to the right of wormtail stepped forward and lucius malfoys voice spoke from under the maskmaster we crave to know we beg you to tell us how you have achieved this this miracle how you managed to return to us ah what a story it is lucius said voldemort and it begins and ends with my young friend herehe walked lazily over to stand next to harry so that the eyes of the whole circle were upon the two of them the snake continued to circleyou know of course that they have called this boy my downfall voldemort said softly his red eyes upon harry whose scar began to burn so fiercely that he almost screamed in agony you all know that on the night i lost my powers and my body i tried to kill him his mother died in the attempt to save him and unwittingly provided him with a protection i admit i had not foreseen i could not touch the boyvoldemort raised one of his long white fingers and put it very close to harrys cheekhis mother left upon him the traces other sacrifice this is old magic i should have remembered it i was foolish to overlook it but no matter i can touch him nowharry felt the cold tip of the long white finger touch him and thought his head would burst with the pain voldemort laughed softly in his ear then took the finger away and continued addressing the death eatersi miscalculated my friends i admit it my curse was deflected by the womans foolish sacrifice and it rebounded upon myself aaah pain beyond pain my friends nothing could have prepared me for it i was ripped from my body i was less than spirit less than the meanest ghost but still i was alive what i was even i do not know i who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality you know my goal to conquer death and now i was tested and it appeared that one or more of my experiments had worked for i had not been killed though the curse should have done it nevertheless i was as powerless as the weakest creature alive and without the means to help myself for i had no body and every spell that might have helped me required the use of a wand i remember only forcing myself sleeplessly endlessly second by second to exist i settled in a faraway place in a forest and i waited surely one of my faithful death eaters would try and find me one of them would come and perform the magic i could not to restore me to a body but i waited in vain the shiver ran once more around the circle of listening death eaters voldemort let the silence spiral horribly before continuingonly one power remained to me i could possess the bodies of others but i dared not go where other humans were plentiful for i knew that the aurors were still abroad and searching for mei sometimes inhabited animals snakes of course being my preference but i was little better off inside them than as pure spirit for their bodies were ill adapted to perform magic and my possession of them shortened their lives none of them lasted long then four years ago the means for my return seemed assured a wizard young foolish and gullible wandered across my path in the forest i had made my home oh he seemed the very chance i had been dreaming of for he was a teacher at dumbledores school he was easy to bend to my will he brought me back to this country and after a while i took possession of his body to supervise him closely as he carried out my orders but my plan failed i did not manage to steal the sorcerers stone i was not to be assured immortal life i was thwarted thwarted once again by harry potter silence once more nothing was stirring not even the leaves on the yew tree the death eaters were quite motionless the glittering eyes in their masks fixed upon voldemort and upon harrythe servant died when i left his body and i was left as weak as ever i had been voldemort continued i returned to my hiding place far away and i will not pretend to you that i didnt then fear that i might never regain my powers yes that was perhaps my darkest hour i could not hope that i would be sent another wizard to possess and i had given up hope now that any of my death eaters cared what had become of me one or two of the masked wizards in the circle moved uncomfortably but voldemort took no noticeand then not even a year ago when i had almost abandoned hope it happened at last a servant returned to me wormtail here who had faked his own death to escape justice was driven out of hiding by those he had once counted friends and decided to return to his master he sought me in the country where it had long been rumored i was hiding helped of course by the rats he met along the way wormtail has a curious affinity with rats do you not wormtail his filthy little friends told him there was a place deep in an albanian forest that they avoided where small animals like themselves had met their deaths by a dark shadow that possessed them but his journey back to me was not smooth was it wormtail for hungry one night on the edge of the very forest where he had hoped to find me he foolishly stopped at an inn for some food and who should he meet there but one bertha jorkins a witch from the ministry of magicnow see the way that fate favors lord voldemort this might have been the end of wormtail and of my last hope for regeneration but wormtail displaying a presence of mind i would never have expected from him convinced bertha jorkins to accompany him on a nighttime stroll he overpowered her he brought her to me and bertha jorkins who might have ruined all proved instead to be a gift beyond my wildest dreams for with a little persuasion she became a veritable mine of informationshe told me that the triwizard tournament would be played at hogwarts this year she told me that she knew of a faithful death eater who would be only too willing to help me if i could only contact him she told me many things but the means i used to break the memory charm upon her were powerful and when i had extracted all useful information from her her mind and body were both damaged beyond repair she had now served her purpose i could not possess her i disposed of hervoldemort smiled his terrible smile his red eyes blank and pitilesswormtails body of course was ill adapted for possession as all assumed him dead and would attract far too much attention if noticed however he was the ablebodied servant i needed and poor wizard though he is wormtail was able to follow the instructions i gave him which would return me to a rudimentary weak body of my own a body i would be able to inhabit while awaiting the essential ingredients for true rebirth a spell or two of my own invention a little help from my dear nagini voldemorts red eyes fell upon the continually circling snake a potion concocted from unicorn blood and the snake venom nagini provided i was soon returned to an almost human form and strong enough to travelthere was no hope of stealing the sorcerers stone anymore for i knew that dumbledore would have seen to it that it was destroyed but i was willing to embrace mortal life again before chasing immortality i set my sights lower i would settle for my old body back again and my old strengthi knew that to achieve this it is an old piece of dark magic the potion that revived me tonight i would need three powerful ingredients well one of them was already at hand was it not wormtail flesh given by a servant my fathers bone naturally meant that we would have to come here where he was buried but the blood of a foe wormtail would have had me use any wizard would you not wormtail any wizard who had hated me as so many of them still do but i knew the one i must use if i was to rise again more powerful than i had been when i had fallen i wanted harry potters blood i wanted the blood of the one who had stripped me of power thirteen years ago for the lingering protection his mother once gave him would then reside in my veins too but how to get at harry potter for he has been better protected than i think even he knows protected in ways devised by dumbledore long ago when it fell to him to arrange the boys future dumbledore invoked an ancient magic to ensure the boys protection as long as he is in his relations care not even i can touch him there then of course there was the quidditch world cup i thought his protection might be weaker there away from his relations and dumbledore but i was not yet strong enough to attempt kidnap in the midst of a horde of ministry wizards and then the boy would return to hogwarts where he is under the crooked nose of that muggleloving fool from morning until night so how could i take himwhy by using bertha jorkinss information of course use my one faithful death eater stationed at hogwarts to ensure that the boys name was entered into the goblet of fire use my death eater to ensure that the boy won the tournament that he touched the triwizard cup first the cup which my death eater had turned into a portkey which would bring him here beyond the reach of dumbledores help and protection and into my waiting arms and here he is the boy you all believed had been my downfall voldemort moved slowly forward and turned to face harry he raised his wandcrucioit was pain beyond anything harry had ever experienced his very bones were on fire his head was surely splitting along his scar his eyes were rolling madly in his head he wanted it to end to black out to die and then it was gone he was hanging limply in the ropes binding him to the headstone of voldemorts father looking up into those bright red eyes through a kind of mist the night was ringing with the sound of the death eaters laughteryou see i think how foolish it was to suppose that this boy could ever have been stronger than me said voldemort but i want there to be no mistake in anybodys mind harry potter escaped me by a lucky chance and i am now going to prove my power by killing him here and now in front of you all when there is no dumbledore to help him and no mother to die for him i will give him his chance he will be allowed to fight and you will be left in no doubt which of us is the stronger just a little longer nagini he whispered and the snake glided away through the grass to where the death eaters stood watchingnow untie him wormtail and give him back his wandchapter thirtyfour priori incantatemwormtail approached harry who scrambled to find his feet to support his own weight before the ropes were untied wormtail raised his new silver hand pulled out the wad of material gagging harry and then with one swipe cut through the bonds tying harry to the gravestonethere was a split second perhaps when harry might have considered running for it but his injured leg shook under him as he stood on the overgrown grave as the death eaters closed ranks forming a tighter circle around him and voldemort so that the gaps where the missing death eaters should have stood were filled wormtail walked out of the circle to the place where cedrics body lay and returned with harrys wand which he thrust roughly into harrys hand without looking at him then wormtail resumed his place in the circle of watching death eatersyou have been taught how to duel harry potter said voldemort softly his red eyes glinting through the darknessat these words harry remembered as though from a former life the dueling club at hogwarts he had attended briefly two years ago all he had learned there was the disarming spell expelliarmus and what use would it be to deprive voldemort of his wand even if he could when he was surrounded by death eaters outnumbered by at least thirty to one he had never learned anything that could possibly fit him for this he knew he was facing the thing against which moody had always warned the unblockable avada kedavra curse and voldemort was right his mother was not here to die for him this time he was quite unprotected we bow to each other harry said voldemort bending a little but keeping his snakelike face upturned to harry come the niceties must be observed dumbledore would like you to show manners bow to death harry the death eaters were laughing again voldemorts lipless mouth was smiling harry did not bow he was not going to let voldemort play with him before killing him he was not going to give him that satisfaction i said bow voldemort said raising his wand and harry felt his spine curve as though a huge invisible hand were bending him ruthlessly forward and the death eaters laughed harder than eververy good said voldemort softly and as he raised his wand the pressure bearing down upon harry lifted too and now you face me like a man straightbacked and proud the way your father died and now we duelvoldemort raised his wand and before harry could do anything to defend himself before he could even move he had been hit again by the cruciatus curse the pain was so intense so allconsuming that he no longer knew where he was whitehot knives were piercing every inch of his skin his head was surely going to burst with pain he was screaming more loudly than hed ever screamed in his life and then it stopped harry rolled over and scrambled to his feet he was shaking as uncontrollably as wormtail had done when his hand had been cut off he staggered sideways into the wall of watching death eaters and they pushed him away back toward voldemorta little break said voldemort the slitlike nostrils dilating with excitement a little pause that hurt didnt it harry you dont want me to do that again do youharry didnt answer he was going to die like cedric those pitiless red eyes were telling him so he was going to die and there was nothing he could do about it but he wasnt going to play along he wasnt going to obey voldemort he wasnt going to beg i asked you whether you want me to do that again said voldemort softly answer me imperialand harry felt for the third time in his life the sensation that his mind had been wiped of all thought ah it was bliss not to think it was as though he were floating dreaming just answer no say no just answer no i will not said a stronger voice in the back of his head i wont answer just answer no i wont do it i wont say it just answer no i wontand these words burst from harrys mouth they echoed through the graveyard and the dream state was lifted as suddenly as though cold water had been thrown over him back rushed the aches that the cruciatus curse had left all over his body back rushed the realization of where he was and what he was facing you wont said voldemort quietly and the death eaters were not laughing now you wont say no harry obedience is a virtue i need to teach you before you die perhaps another little dose of painvoldemort raised his wand but this time harry was ready with the reflexes born of his quidditch training he flung himself sideways onto the ground he rolled behind the marble headstone of voldemort s father and he heard it crack as the curse missed himwe are not playing hideandseek harry said voldemorts soft cold voice drawing nearer as the death eaters laughed you cannot hide from me does this mean you are tired of our duel does this mean that you would prefer me to finish it now harry come out harry come out and play then it will be quick it might even be painless i would not know i have never died harry crouched behind the headstone and knew the end had come there was no hope no help to be had and as he heard voldemort draw nearer still he knew one thing only and it was beyond fear or reason he was not going to die crouching here like a child playing hideandseek he was not going to die kneeling at voldemort s feet he was going to die upright like his father and he was going to die trying to defend himself even if no defense was possible before voldemort could stick his snakelike face around the headstone harry stood up he gripped his wand tightly in his hand thrust it out in front of him and threw himself around the headstone facing voldemortvoldemort was ready as harry shouted expelliarmus voldemort cried avada kedavraa jet of green light issued from voldemorts wand just as a jet of red light blasted from harrys they met in midair and suddenly harrys wand was vibrating as though an electric charge were surging through it his hand seized up around it he couldnt have released it if hed wanted to and a narrow beam of light connected the two wands neither red nor green but bright deep gold harry following the beam with his astonished gaze saw that voldemorts long white fingers too were gripping a wand that was shaking and vibratingand then nothing could have prepared harry for this he felt his feet lift from the ground he and voldemort were both being raised into the air their wands still connected by that thread of shimmering golden light they glided away from the tombstone of voldemorts father and then came to rest on a patch of ground that was clear and free of graves the death eaters were shouting they were asking voldemort for instructions they were closing in reforming the circle around harry and voldemort the snake slithering at their heels some of them drawing their wands the golden thread connecting harry and voldemort splintered though the wands remained connected a thousand more beams arced high over harry and voldemort crisscrossing all around them until they were enclosed in a golden domeshaped web acage of light beyond which the death eaters circled like jackals their cries strangely muffled now do nothing voldemort shrieked to the death eaters and harry saw his red eyes wide with astonishment at what was happening saw him fighting to break the thread of light still connecting his wand with harrys harry held onto his wand more tightly with both hands and the golden thread remained unbroken do nothing unless i command you voldemort shouted to the death eatersand then an unearthly and beautiful sound filled the air it was coming from every thread of the lightspun web vibrating around harry and voldemort it was a sound harry recognized though he had heard it only once before in his life phoenix songit was the sound of hope to harry the most beautiful and welcome thing he had ever heard in his life he felt as though the song were inside him instead of just around him it was the sound he connected with dumbledore and it was almost as though a friend were speaking in his ear dont break the connectioni know harry told the music i know i mustnt but no sooner had he thought it than the thing became much harder to do his wand began to vibrate more powerfully than ever and now the beam between him and voldemort changed too it was as though large beads of light were sliding up and down the thread connecting the wands harry felt his wand give a shudder under his hand as the light beads began to slide slowly and steadily his way the direction of the beams movement was now toward him from voldemort and he felt his wand shudder angrily as the closest bead of light moved nearer to harrys wand tip the wood beneath his fingers grew so hot he feared it would burst into flame the closer that bead moved the harder harrys wand vibrated he was sure his wand would not survive contact with it it felt as though it was about to shatter under his fingers he concentrated every last particle of his mind upon forcing the bead back toward voldemort his ears full of phoenix song his eyes furious fixed and slowly very slowly the beads quivered to a halt and then just as slowly they began to move the other way and it was voldemorts wand that was vibrating extrahard now voldemort who looked astonished and almost fearful one of the beads of light was quivering inches from the tip of voldemorts wand harry didnt understand why he was doing it didnt know what it might achieve but he now concentrated as he had never done in his life on forcing that bead of light right back into voldemort s wand and slowly very slowly it moved along the golden thread it trembled for a moment and then it connected at once voldemorts wand began to emit echoing screams of pain then voldemorts red eyes widened with shock a dense smoky hand flew out of the tip of it and vanished the ghost of the hand he had made wormtail more shouts of pain and then something much larger began to blossom from voldemorts wand tip a great grayish something that looked as though it were made of the solidest densest smoke it was a head now a chest and arms the torso of cedric diggoryif ever harry might have released his wand from shock it would have been then but instinct kept him clutching his wand tightly so that the thread of golden light remained unbroken even though the thick gray ghost of cedric diggory was it a ghost it looked sosolid emerged in its entirety from the end of voldemort s wand as though it were squeezing itself out of a very narrow tunnel and this shade of cedric stood up and looked up and down the golden thread of light and spokehold on harry it saidits voice was distant and echoing harry looked at voldemort his wide red eyes were still shocked he had no more expected this than harry had and very dimly harry heard the frightened yells of the death eaters prowling around the edges of the golden dome more screams of pain from the wand and then something else emerged from its tip the dense shadow of a second head quickly followed by arms and torso an old man harry had seen only in a dream was now pushing himself out of the end of the wand just as cedric had done and his ghost or his shadow or whatever it was fell next to cedrics and surveyed harry and voldemort and the golden web and the connected wands with mild surprise leaning on his walking stick he was a real wizard then the old man said his eyes on voldemort killed me that one did you fight him boy but already yet another head was emerging and this head gray as a smoky statue was a womans harry both arms shaking now as he fought to keep his wand still saw her drop to the ground and straighten up like the others staring the shadow of bertha jorkins surveyed the battle before her with wide eyesdont let go now she cried and her voice echoed like cedrics as though from very far away dont let him get you harry dont let goshe and the other two shadowy figures began to pace around the inner walls of the golden web while the death eaters flitted around the outside of it and voldemorts dead victims whispered as they circled the duelers whispered words of encouragement to harry and hissed words harry couldnt hear to voldemortand now another head was emerging from the tip of voldemorts wand and harry knew when he saw it who it would be he knew as though he had expected it from the moment when cedric had appeared from the wand knew because the man appearing was the one hed thought of more than any other tonight the smoky shadow of a tall man with untidy hair fell to the ground as bertha had done straightened up and looked at him and harry his arms shaking madly now looked back into the ghostly face of his fatheryour mothers coming he said quietly she wants to see you it will be all right hold on and she came first her head then her body a young woman with long hair the smoky shadowy form of lily potter blossomed from the end of voldemorts wand fell to the ground and straightened like her husband she walked close to harry looking down at him and she spoke in the same distant echoing voice as the others but quietly so that voldemort his face now livid with fear as his victims prowled around him could not hear when the connection is broken we will linger for only moments but we will give you time you must get to the portkey it will return you to hogwarts do you understand harryyes harry gasped fighting now to keep a hold on his wand which was slipping and sliding beneath his fingersharry whispered the figure of cedric take my body back will you take my body back to my parents i will said harry his face screwed up with the effort of holding the wanddo it now whispered his fathers voice be ready to run do it now now harry yelled he didnt think he could have held on for another moment anyway he pulled his wand upward with an almighty wrench and the golden thread broke the cage of light vanished the phoenix song died but the shadowy figures of voldemorts victims did not disappear they were closing in upon voldemort shielding harry from his gaze and harry ran as he had never run in his life knocking two stunned death eaters aside as he passed he zigzagged behind headstones feeling their curses following him hearing them hit the headstones he was dodging curses and graves pelting toward cedrics body no longer aware of the pain in his leg his whole being concentrated on what he had to do stun him he heard voldemort screamten feet from cedric harry dived behind a marble angel to avoid the jets of red light and saw the tip of its wing shatter as the spells hit it gripping his wand more tightly he dashed out from behind the angel impedimenta he bellowed pointing his wand wildly over his shoulder at the death eaters running at himfrom a muffled yell he thought he had stopped at least one of them but there was no time to stop and look he jumped over the cup and dived as he heard more wand blasts behind him more jets of light flew over his head as he fell stretching out his hand to grab cedrics armstand aside i will kill him he is mine shrieked voldemort harrys hand had closed on cedrics wrist one tombstone stood between him and voldemort but cedric was too heavy to carry and the cup was out of reach voldemorts red eyes flamed in the darkness harry saw his mouth curl into a smile saw him raise his wandaccio harry yelled pointing his wand at the triwizard cup it flew into the air and soared toward him harry caught it by the handle he heard voldemort s scream of fury at the same moment that he felt the jerk behind his navel that meant the portkey had worked it was speeding him away in a whirl of wind and color and cedric along with him they were going backchapter thirtyfive veritaserumharry felt himself slam flat into the ground his face was pressed into grass the smell of it filled his nostrils he had closed his eyes while the portkey transported him and he kept them closed now he did not move all the breath seemed to have been knocked out of him his head was swimming so badly he felt as though the ground beneath him were swaying like the deck of a ship to hold himself steady he tightened his hold on the two things he was still clutching the smooth cold handle of the triwizard cup and cedrics body he felt as though he would slide away into the blackness gathering at the edges of his brain if he let go of either of them shock and exhaustion kept him on the ground breathing in the smell of the grass waiting waiting for someone to do something something to happen and all the while his scar burned dully on his forehead a torrent of sound deafened and confused him there were voices everywhere footsteps screams he remained where he was his face screwed up against the noise as though it were a nightmare that would pass then a pair of hands seized him roughly and turned him overharry harryhe opened his eyeshe was looking up at the starry sky and albus dumbledore was crouched over him the dark shadows of a crowd of people pressed in around them pushing nearer harry felt the ground beneath his head reverberating with their footstepshe had come back to the edge of the maze he could see the stands rising above him the shapes of people moving in them the stars aboveharry let go of the cup but he clutched cedric to him even more tightly he raised his free hand and seized dumbledores wrist while dumbledores face swam in and out of focushes back harry whispered hes back voldemortwhats going on whats happenedthe face of cornelius fudge appeared upside down over harry it looked white appalledmy god diggory it whispered dumbledore hes deadthe words were repeated the shadowy figures pressing in on them gasped it to those around them and then others shouted it screeched it into the night hes dead hes dead cedric diggory deadharry let go of him he heard fudges voice say and he felt fingers trying to pry him from cedrics limp body but harry wouldnt let him go then dumbledores face which was still blurred and misted came closer harry you cant help him now its over let gohe wanted me to bring him back harry muttered it seemed important to explain this he wanted me to bring him back to his parents thats right harry just let go now dumbledore bent down and with extraordinary strength for a man so old and thin raised harry from the ground and set him on his feet harry swayed his head was pounding his injured leg would no longer support his weight the crowd around them jostled fighting to get closer pressing darkly in on him whats happened whats wrong with him diggorys deadhell need to go to the hospital wing fudge was saying loudly hes ill hes injured dumbledore diggorys parents theyre here theyre in the stands ill take harry dumbledore ill take him no i would preferdumbledore amos diggorys running hes coming over dont you think you should tell him before he sees harry stay here girls were screaming sobbing hysterically the scene flickered oddly before harrys eyes its all right son ive got you come on hospital wing dumbledore said stay said harry thickly the pounding in his scar making him feel as though he was about to throw up his vision was blurring worse than everyou need to lie down come on nowsomeone larger and stronger than he was was half pulling half carrying him through the frightened crowd harry heard people gasping screaming and shouting as the man supporting him pushed a path through them taking him back to the castle across the lawn past the lake and the durmstrang ship harry heard nothing but the heavy breathing of the man helping him walkwhat happened harry the man asked at last as he lifted harry up the stone steps clunk clunk clunk it was madeye moodycup was a portkey said harry as they crossed the entrance hall took me and cedric to a graveyard and voldemort was there lord voldemortclunk clunk clunk up the marble stairs the dark lord was

this harry heard a key scrape in a lock and felt a cup being pushed into his handsdrink it youll feel better come on now harry i need to know exactly what happened moody helped tip the stuff down harrys throat he coughed a peppery taste burning his throat moodys office came into sharper focus and so did moody himself he looked as white as fudge had looked and both eyes were fixed unblinkingly upon harrys facevoldemorts back harry youre sure hes back how did he do ithe took stuff from his fathers grave and from wormtail and me said harry his head felt clearer his scar wasnt hurting so badly he could now see moodys face distinctly even though the office was dark he could still hear screaming and shouting from the distant quidditch fieldwhat did the dark lord take from you said moodyblood said harry raising his arm his sleeve was ripped where wormtails dagger had torn itmoody let out his breath in a long low hissand the death eaters they returnedyes said harry loads of them how did he treat them moody asked quietly did he forgive thembut harry had suddenly remembered he should have told dumbledore he should have said it straightaway theres a death eater at hogwarts theres a death eater here they put my name in the goblet of fire they made sure i got through to the end harry tried to get up but moody pushed him back downi know who the death eater is he said quietlykarkaroff said harry wildly where is he have you got him is he locked upkarkaroff said moody with an odd laugh karkaroff fled tonight when he felt the dark mark burn upon his arm he betrayed too many faithful supporters of the dark lord to wish to meet them but i doubt he will get far the dark lord has ways of tracking his enemieskarkaroffs gone he ran away but then he didnt put my name in the gobletno said moody slowly no he didnt it was i who did thatharry heard but didnt believeno you didnt he said you didnt do that you cant have donei assure you i did said moody and his magical eye swung around and fixed upon the door and harry knew he was making sure that there was no one outside it at the same time moody drew out his wand and pointed it at harryhe forgave them then he said the death eaters who went free the ones who escaped azkabanwhat said harryhe was looking at the wand moody was pointing at him this was a bad joke it had to bei asked you said moody quietly whether he forgave the scum who never even went to look for him those treacherous cowards who wouldnt even brave azkaban for him the faithless worthless bits of filth who were brave enough to cavort in masks at the quidditch world cup but fled at the sight of the dark mark when i fired it into the skyyou fired what are you talking about i told you harry i told you if theres one thing i hate more than any other its a death eater who walked free they turned their backs on my master when he needed them most i expected him to punish them i expected him to torture them tell me hehurt them harry moodys face was suddenly lit with an insane smile tell me he told them that i i alone remained faithful prepared to risk everything to deliver to him the one thing he wanted above all youyou didnt it it cant be you who put your name in the goblet of fire under the name of a different school i did who frightened off every person i thought might try to hurt you or prevent you from winning the tournament i did who nudged hagrid into showing you the dragons i did who helped you see the only way you could beat the dragon i didmoodys magical eye had now left the door it was fixed upon harry his lopsided mouth leered more widely than everit hasnt been easy harry guiding you through these tasks without arousing suspicion i have had to use every ounce of cunning i possess so that my hand would not be detectable in your success dumbledore would have been very suspicious if you had managed everything too easily as long as you got into that maze preferably with a decent head start then i knew i would have a chance of getting rid of the other champions and leaving your way clear but i also had to contend with your stupidity the second task that was when i was most afraid we would fail i was keeping watch on you potter i knew you hadnt worked out the eggs clue so i had to give you another hint you didnt harry said hoarsely cedric gave me the clue who told cedric to open it underwater i did i trusted that he would pass the information on to you decent people are so easy to manipulate potter i was sure cedric would want to repay you for telling him about the dragons and so he did but even thenpotter even then you seemed likely to fail i was watching all the time all those hours in the library didnt you realize that the book you needed was in your dormitory all along i planted it there early on i gave it to the longbottom boy dont you remember magical water plants of the mediterranean it would have told you all you needed to know about gillyweed i expected you to ask everyone and anyone you could for help longbottom would have told you in an instant but you did not you did not you have a streak of pride and independence that might have ruined allso what could i do feed you information from another innocent source you told me at the yule ball a houseelf called dobby had given you a christmas present i called the elf to the staffroom to collect some robes for cleaning i staged a loud conversation with professor mcgonagall about the hostages who had been taken and whether potter would think to use gillyweed and your little elf friend ran straight to snapes office and then hurried to find youmoodys wand was still pointing directly at harrys heart over his shoulder foggy shapes were moving in the foeglass on the wallyou were so long in that lake potter i thought you had drowned but luckily dumbledore took your idiocy for nobility and marked you high for it i breathed againyou had an easier time of it than you should have in that maze tonight of course said moody i was patrolling around it able to see through the outer hedges able to curse many obstacles out of your way i stunned fleur delacour as she passed i put the imperius curse on krum so that he would finish diggory and leave your path to the cup clearharry stared at moody he just didnt see how this could be dumbledores friend the famous auror the one who had caught so many death eaters it made no sense no sense at all the foggy shapes in the foeglass were sharpening had become more distinct harry could see the outlines of three people over moodys shoulder moving closer and closer but moody wasnt watching them his magical eye was upon harrythe dark lord didnt manage to kill you potter and he so wanted to whispered moody imagine how he will reward me when he finds i have done it for him i gave you to him the thing he needed above all to regenerate and then i killed you for him i will be honored beyond all other death eaters i will be his dearest his closest supporter closer than a son moodys normal eye was bulging the magical eye fixed upon harry the door was barred and harry knew he would never reach his own wand in time the dark lord and i said moody and he looked completely insane now towering over harry leering down at him have much in common both of us for instance had very disappointing fathers very disappointing indeed both of us suffered the indignity harry of being named after those fathers and both of us had the pleasure the very great pleasure of killing our fathers to ensure the continued rise of the dark orderyoure mad harry said he couldnt stop himself youre madmad am i said moody his voice rising uncontrollably well see well see whos mad now that the dark lord has returned with me at his side he is back harry potter you did not conquer him and now i conquer youmoody raised his wand he opened his mouth harry plunged his own hand into his robes stupefy there was a blinding flash of red light and with a great splintering and crashing the door of moodys office was blasted apart moody was thrown backward onto the office floor harry still staring at the place where moodys face had been saw albus dumbledore professor snape and professor mcgonagall looking back at him out of the foeglass he looked around and saw the three of them standing in the doorway dumbledore in front his wand outstretchedat that moment harry fully understood for the first time why people said dumbledore was the only wizard voldemort had ever feared the look upon dumbledores face as he stared down at the unconscious form of madeye moody was more terrible than harry could have ever imagined there was no benign smile upon dumbledores face no twinkle in the eyes behind the spectacles there was cold fury in every line of the ancient face a sense of power radiated from dumbledore as though he were giving off burning heathe stepped into the office placed a foot underneath moodys unconscious body and kicked him over onto his back so that his face was visible snape followed him looking into the foeglass where his own face was still visible glaring into the room professor mcgonagall went straight to harrycome along potter she whispered the thin line of her mouth was twitching as though she was about to cry come along hospital wing no said dumbledore sharplydumbledore he ought to look at him hes been through enough tonight he will stay minerva because he needs to understand said dumbledore curtly understanding is the first step to acceptance and only with acceptance can there be recovery he needs to know who has put him through the ordeal he has suffered tonight and whymoody harry said he was still in a state of complete disbelief how can it have been moodythis is not alastor moody said dumbledore quietly you have never known alastor moody the real moody would not have removed you from my sight after what happened tonight the moment he took you i knew and i followeddumbledore bent down over moodys limp form and put a hand inside his robes he pulled out moodys hip flask and a set of keys on a ring then he turned to professors mcgonagall and snapeseverus please fetch me the strongest truth potion you possess and then go down to the kitchens and bring up the houseelf called winky minerva kindly go down to hagrids house where you will find a large black dog sitting in the pumpkin patch take the dog up to my office tell him i will be with him shortly then come back hereif either snape or mcgonagall found these instructions peculiar they hid their confusion both turned at once and left the office dumbledore walked over to the trunk with seven locks fitted the first key in the lock and opened it it contained a mass of spellbooks dumbledore closed the trunk placed a second key in the second lock and opened the trunk again the spellbooks had vanished this time it contained an assortment of broken sneakoscopes some parchment and quills and what looked like a silvery invisibility cloak harry watched astounded as dumbledore placed the third fourth fifth and sixth keys in their respective locks reopening the trunk each time and revealing different contents each time then he placed the seventh key in the lock threw open the lid and harry let out a cry of amazementhe was looking down into a kind of pit an underground room and lying on the floor some ten feet below apparently fast asleep thin and starved in appearance was the real madeye moody his wooden leg was gone the socket that should have held the magical eye looked empty beneath its lid and chunks of his grizzled hair were missing harry stared thunderstruck between the sleeping moody in the trunk and the unconscious moody lying on the floor of the officedumbledore climbed into the trunk lowered himself and fell lightly onto the floor beside the sleeping moody he bent over himstunned controlled by the imperius curse very weak he said of course they would have needed to keep him alive harry throw down the imposters cloak hes freezing madam pomfrey will need to see him but he seems in no immediate dangerharry did as he was told dumbledore covered moody in the cloak tucked it around him and clambered out of the trunk again then he picked up the hip flask that stood upon the desk unscrewed it and turned it over a thick glutinous liquid splattered onto the office floorpolyjuice potion harry said dumbledore you see the simplicity of it and the brilliance for moody never does drink except from his hip flask hes well known for it the imposter needed of course to keep the real moody close by so that he could continue making the potion you see his hair dumbledore looked down on the moody in the trunk the imposter has been cutting it off all year see where it is uneven but i think in the excitement of tonight our fake moody might have forgotten to take it as frequendy as he should have done on the hour every hour we shall seedumbledore pulled out the chair at the desk and sat down upon it his eyes fixed upon the unconscious moody on the floor harry stared at him too minutes passed in silence then before harrys very eyes the face of the man on the floor began to change the scars were disappearing the skin was becoming smooth the mangled nose became whole and started to shrink the long mane of grizzled gray hair was withdrawing into the scalp and turning the color of straw suddenly with a loud clunk the wooden leg fell away as a normal leg regrew in its place next moment the magical eyeball had popped out of the mans face as a real eye replaced it it rolled away across the floor and continued to swivel in every directionharry saw a man lying before him paleskinned slightly freckled with a mop of fair hair he knew who he was he had seen him in dumbledores pensieve had watched him being led away from court by the dementors trying to convince mr crouch that he was innocent but he was lined around the eyes now and looked much older there were hurried footsteps outside in the corridor snape had returned with winky at his heels professor mcgonagall was right behind themcrouch snape said stopping dead in the doorway barty crouchgood heavens said professor mcgonagall stopping dead and staring down at the man on the floorfilthy disheveled winky peered around snapes legs her mouth opened wide and she let out a piercing shriekmaster barty master barty what is you doing hereshe flung herself forward onto the young mans chestyou is killed him you is killed him you is killed masters sonhe is simply stunned winky said dumbledore step aside please severus you have the potionsnape handed dumbledore a small glass bottle of completely clear liquid the veritaserum with which he had threatened harry in class dumbledore got up bent over the man on the floor and pulled him into a sitting position against the wall beneath the foeglass in which the reflections of dumbledore snape and mcgonagall were still glaring down upon them all winky remained on her knees trembling her hands over her face dumbledore forced the mans mouth open and poured three drops inside it then he pointed his wand at the mans chest and said ennervatecrouchs son opened his eyes his face was slack his gaze unfocused dumbledore knelt before him so that their faces were levelcan you hear me dumbledore asked quietlythe mans eyelids flickeredyes he mutteredi would like you to tell us said dumbledore softly how you came to be here how did you escape from azkabancrouch took a deep shuddering breath then began to speak in a flat expressionless voicemy mother saved me she knew she was dying she persuaded my father to rescue me as a last favor to her he loved her as he had never loved me he agreed they came to visit me they gave me a draft of polyjuice potion containing one of my mothers hairs she took a draft of polyjuice potion containing one of my hairs we took on each others appearancewinky was shaking her head tremblingsay no more master barty say no more you is getting your father into troublebut crouch took another deep breath and continued in the same flat voicethe dementors are blind they sensed one healthy one dying person entering azkaban they sensed one healthy one dying person leaving it my father smuggled me out disguised as my mother in case any prisoners were watching through their doorsmy mother died a short while afterward in azkaban she was careful to drink polyjuice potion until the end she was buried under my name and bearing my appearance everyone believed her to be methe mans eyelids flickeredand what did your father do with you when he had got you home said dumbledore quietlystaged my mothers death a quiet private funeral that grave is empty the houseelf nursed me back to health then i had to be concealed i had to be controlled my father had to use a number of spells to subdue me when i had recovered my strength i thought only of finding my master of returning to his servicehow did your father subdue you said dumbledorethe imperius curse moody said i was under my fathers control i was forced to wear an invisibility cloak day and night i was always with the houseelf she was my keeper and caretaker she pitied me she persuaded my father to give me occasional treats rewards for my good behaviormaster barty master barty sobbed winky through her hands you isnt ought to tell them we is getting in trouble did anybody ever discover that you were still alive said dumbledore softly did anyone know except your father and the houseelfyes said crouch his eyelids flickering again a witch in my fathers office bertha jorkins she came to the house with papers for my father s signature he was not at home winky showed her inside and returned to the kitchen to me but bertha jorkins heard winky talking to me she came to investigate she heard enough to guess who was hiding under the invisibility cloak my father arrived home she confronted him he put a very powerful memory charm on her to make her forget what shed found out too powerful he said it damaged her memory permanentlywhy is she coming to nose into my masters private business sobbed winky why isnt she leaving us betell me about the quidditch world cup said dumbledorewinky talked my father into it said crouch still in the same monotonous voice she spent months persuading him i had not left the house for years i had loved quidditch let him go she said he will be in his invisibility cloak he can watch let him smell fresh air for once she said my mother would have wanted it she told my father that my mother had died to give me freedom she had not saved me for a life of imprisonment he agreed in the endit was carefully planned my father led me and winky up to the top box early in the day winky was to say that she was saving a seat for my father i was to sit there invisible when everyone had left the box we would emerge winky would appear to be alone nobody would ever knowbut winky didnt know that i was growing stronger i was starting to fight my fathers imperius curse there were times when i was almost myself again there were brief periods when i seemed outside his control it happened there in the top box it was like waking from a deep sleep i found myself out in public in the middle of the match and i saw in front of me a wand sticking out of a boys pocket i had not been allowed a wand since before azkaban i stole it winky didnt know winky is frightened of heights she had her face hiddenmaster barty you bad boy whispered winky tears trickling between her fingersso you took the wand said dumbledore and what did you do with itwe went back to the tent said crouch then we heard them we heard the death eaters the ones who had never been to azkaban the ones who had never suffered for my master they had turned their backs on him they were not enslaved as i was they were free to seek him but they did not they were merely making sport of muggles the sound of their voices awoke me my mind was clearer than it had been in years i was angry i had the wandi wanted to attack them for their disloyalty to my master my father had left the tent he had gone to free the muggles winky was afraid to see me so angry she used her own brand of magic to bind me to her she pulled me from the tent pulled me into the forest away from the death eaters i tried to hold her back i wanted to return to the campsite i wanted to show those death eaters what loyalty to the dark lord meant and to punish them for their lack of it i used the stolen wand to cast the dark mark into the skyministry wizards arrived they shot stunning spells everywhere one of the spells came through the trees where winky and i stood the bond connecting us was broken we were both stunnedwhen winky was discovered my father knew i must be nearby he searched the bushes where she had been found and felt me lying there he waited until the other ministry members had left the forest he put me back under the imperius curse and took me home he dismissed winky she had failed him she had let me acquire a wand she had almost let me escapewinky let out a wail of despairnow it was just father and i alone in the house and then and then crouchs head rolled on his neck and an insane grin spread across his face my master came for mehe arrived at our house late one night in the arms of his servant wormtail my master had found out that i was still alive he had captured bertha jorkins in albania he had tortured her she told him a great deal she told him about the triwizard tournament she told him the old auror moody was going to teach at hogwarts he tortured her until he broke through the memory charm my father had placed upon her she told him i had escaped from azkaban she told him my father kept me imprisoned to prevent me from seeking my master and so my master knew that i was still his faithful servant perhaps the most faithful of all my master conceived a plan based upon the information bertha had given him he needed me he arrived at our house near midnight my father answered the doorthe smile spread wider over crouchs face as though recalling the sweetest memory of his life winkys petrified brown eyes were visible through her fingers she seemed too appalled to speakit was very quick my father was placed under the imperius curse by my master now my father was the one imprisoned controlled my master forced him to go about his business as usual to act as though nothing was wrong and i was released i awoke i was myself again alive as i hadnt been in yearsand what did lord voldemort ask you to do said dumbledorehe asked me whether i was ready to risk everything for him i was ready it was my dream my greatest ambition to serve him to prove myself to him he told me he needed to place a faithful servant at hogwarts a servant who would guide harry potter through the triwizard tournament without appearing to do so a servant who would watch over harry potter ensure he reached the triwizard cup turn the cup into a portkey which would take the first person to touch it to my master but first you needed alastor moody said dumbledore his blue eyes were blazing though his voice remained calmwormtail and i did it we had prepared the polyjuice potion beforehand we journeyed to his house moody put up a struggle there was a commotion we managed to subdue him just in time forced him into a compartment of his own magical trunk took some of his hair and added it to the potion i drank it i became moodys double i took his leg and his eye i was ready to face arthur weasley when he arrived to sort out the muggles who had heard a disturbance i made the dustbins move around the yard i told arthur weasley i had heard intruders in my yard who had set off the dustbins then i packed up moodys clothes and dark detectors put them in the trunk with moody and set off for hogwarts i kept him alive under the imperius curse i wanted to be able to question him to find out about his past learn his habits so that i could fool even dumbledore i also needed his hair to make the polyjuice potion the other ingredients were easy i stole boomslang skin from the dungeons when the potions master found me in his office i said i was under orders to search itand what became of wormtail after you attacked moody said dumbledorewormtail returned to care for my master in my fathers house and to keep watch over my fatherbut your father escaped said dumbledoreyes after a while he began to fight the imperius curse just as i had done there were periods when he knew what was happening my master decided it was no longer safe for my father to leave the house he forced him to send letters to the ministry instead he made him write and say he was ill but wormtail neglected his duty he was not watchful enough my father escaped my master guessed that he was heading for hogwarts my father was going to tell dumbledore everything to confess he was going to admit that he had smuggled me from azkabanmy master sent me word of my fathers escape he told me to stop him at all costs so i waited and watched i used the map i had taken from harry potter the map that had almost ruined everythingmap said dumbledore quickly what map is thispotters map of hogwarts potter saw me on it potter saw me stealing more ingredients for the polyjuice potion from snapes office one night he thought i was my father we have the same first name i took the map from potter that night i told him my father hated dark wizards potter believed my father was after snapefor a week i waited for my father to arrive at hogwarts at last one evening the map showed my father entering the grounds i pulled on my invisibility cloak and went down to meet him he was walking around the edge of the forest then potter came and krum i waited i could not hurt potter my master needed him potter ran to get dumbledore i stunned krum i killed my fathernoooo wailed winky master barty master barty what is you sayingyou killed your father dumbledore said in the same soft voice what did you do with the bodycarried it into the forest covered it with the invisibility cloak i had the map with me i watched potter run into the castle he met snape dumbledore joined them i watched potter bringing dumbledore out of the castle i walked back out of the forest doubled around behind them went to meet them i told dumbledore snape had told me where to comedumbledore told me to go and look for my father i went back to my fathers body watched the map when everyone was gone i transfigured my fathers body he became a bone i buried it while wearing the invisibility cloak in the freshly dug earth in front of hagrids cabinthere was complete silence now except for winkys continued sobs then dumbledore said and tonight i offered to carry the triwizard cup into the maze before dinner whispered barty crouch turned it into a portkey my masters plan worked he is returned to power and i will be honored by him beyond the dreams of wizardsthe insane smile lit his features once more and his head drooped onto his shoulder as winky wailed and sobbed at his sidechapter thirtysix the parting of the waysdumbledore stood up he stared down at barty crouch for a moment with disgust on his face then he raised his wand once more and ropes flew out of it ropes that twisted themselves around barty crouch binding him tightly he turned to professor mcgonagallminerva could i ask you to stand guard here while i take harry upstairsof course said professor mcgonagall she looked slightly nauseous as though she had just watched someone being sick however when she drew out her wand and pointed it at barty crouch her hand was quite steadyseverus dumbledore turned to snape please tell madam pomfrey to come down here we need to get alastor moody into the hospital wing then go down into the grounds find cornelius fudge and bring him up to this office he will undoubtedly want to question crouch himself tell him i will be in the hospital wing in half an hours time if he needs mesnape nodded silently and swept out of the roomharry dumbledore said gentlyharry got up and swayed again the pain in his leg which he had not noticed all the time he had been listening to crouch now returned in full measure he also realized that he was shaking dumbledore gripped his arm and helped him out into the dark corridori want you to come up to my office first harry he said quiedy as they headed up the passageway sirius is waiting for us thereharry nodded a kind of numbness and a sense of complete unreality were upon him but he did not care he was even glad of it he didnt want to have to think about anything that had happened since he had first touched the triwizard cup he didnt want to have to examine the memories fresh and sharp as photographs which kept flashing across his mind madeye moody inside the trunk wormtail slumped on the ground cradling his stump of an arm voldemort rising from the steaming cauldron cedric dead cedric asking to be returned to his parents professor harry mumbled where are mr and mrs diggorythey are with professor sprout said dumbledore his voice which had been so calm throughout the interrogation of barty crouch shook very slightly for the first time she was head of cedrics house and knew him bestthey had reached the stone gargoyle dumbledore gave the password it sprang aside and he and harry went up the moving spiral staircase to the oak door dumbledore pushed it open sirius was standing there his face was white and gaunt as it had been when he had escaped azkaban in one swift moment he had crossed the roomharry are you all right i knew it i knew something like this what happenedhis hands shook as he helped harry into a chair in front of the deskwhat happened he asked more urgentlydumbledore began to tell sirius everything barty crouch had said harry was only half listening so tired every bone in his body was aching he wanted nothing more than to sit here undisturbed for hours and hours until he fell asleep and didnt have to think or feel anymorethere was a soft rush of wings fawkes the phoenix had left his perch flown across the office and landed on harrys kneelo fawkes said harry quietly he stroked the phoenixs beautiful scarletandgold plumage fawkes blinked peacefully up at him there was something comforting about his warm weightdumbledore stopped talking he sat down opposite harry behind his desk he was looking at harry who avoided his eyes dumbledore was going to question him he was going to make harry relive everythingi need to know what happened after you touched the portkey in the maze harry said dumbledorewe can leave that till morning cant we dumbledore said sirius harshly he had put a hand on harrys shoulder let him have a sleep let him restharry felt a rush of gratitude toward sirius but dumbledore took no notice of siriuss words he leaned forward toward harryvery unwillingly harry raised his head and looked into those blue eyesif i thought i could help you dumbledore said gently by putting you into an enchanted sleep and allowing you to postpone the moment when you would have to think about what has happened tonight i would do it but i know better numbing the pain for a while will make it worse when you finally feel it you have shown bravery beyond anything i could have expected of you i ask you to demonstrate your courage one more time i ask you to tell us what happenedthe phoenix let out one soft quavering note it shivered in the air and harry felt as though a drop of hot liquid had slipped down his throat into his stomach warming him and strengthening himhe took a deep breath and began to tell them as he spoke visions of everything that had passed that night seemed to rise before his eyes he saw the sparkling surface of the potion that had revived voldemort he saw the death eaters apparating between the graves around them he saw cedrics body lying on the ground beside the cuponce or twice sirius made a noise as though about to say something his hand still tight on harrys shoulder but dumbledore raised his hand to stop him and harry was glad of this because it was easier to keep going now he had started it was even a relief he felt almost as though something poisonous were being extracted from him it was costing him every bit of determination he had to keep talking yet he sensed that once he had finished he would feel betterwhen harry told of wormtail piercing his arm with the dagger however sirius let out a vehement exclamation and dumbledore stood up so quickly that harry started dumbledore walked around the desk and told harry to stretch out his arm harry showed them both the place where his robes were torn and the cut beneath themhe said my blood would make him stronger than if hed used someone elses harry told dumbledore he said the protection my my mother left in me hed have it too and he was right he could touch me without hurting himself he touched my facefor a fleeting instant harry thought he saw a gleam of something like triumph in dumbledores eyes but next second harry was sure he had imagined it for when dumbledore had returned to his seat behind the desk he looked as old and weary as harry had ever seen himvery well he said sitting down again voldemort has overcome that particular barrier harry continue pleaseharry went on he explained how voldemort had emerged from the cauldron and told them all he could remember of voldemorts speech to the death eaters then he told how voldemort had untied him returned his wand to him and prepared to duelbut when he reached the part where the golden beam of light had connected his and voldemorts wands he found his throat obstructed he tried to keep talking but the memories of what had come out of voldemorts wand were flooding into his mind he could see cedric emerging see the old man bertha jorkins his father his mother he was glad when sirius broke the silencethe wands connected he said looking from harry to dumbledore whyharry looked up at dumbledore again on whose face there was an arrested lookpriori incantatem he mutteredhis eyes gazed into harrys and it was almost as though an invisible beam of understanding shot between themthe reverse spell effect said sirius sharplyexactly said dumbledore harrys wand and voldemorts wand share cores each of them contains a feather from the tail of the same phoenix this phoenix in fact he added and he pointed at the scarletandgold bird perching peacefully on harrys kneemy wands feather came from fawkes harry said amazedyes said dumbledore mr ollivander wrote to tell me you had bought the second wand the moment you left his shop four years agoso what happens when a wand meets its brother said siriusthey will not work properly against each other said dumbledore if however the owners of the wands force the wands to do battle a very rare effect will take place one of the wands will force the other to regurgitate spells it has performed in reverse the most recent first and then those which preceded it he looked interrogatively at harry and harry noddedwhich means said dumbledore slowly his eyes upon harrys face that some form of cedric must have reappearedharry nodded againdiggory came back to life said sirius sharplyno spell can reawaken the dead said dumbledore heavily all that would have happened is a kind of reverse echo a shadow of the living cedric would have emerged from the wand am i correct harryhe spoke to me harry said he was suddenly shaking again the the ghost cedric or whatever he was spokean echo said dumbledore which retained cedrics appearance and character i am guessing other such forms appeared less recent victims of voldemorts wandan old man harry said his throat still constricted bertha jorkins and your parents said dumbledore quietlyyes said harrysiriuss grip on harrys shoulder was now so tight it was painfulthe last murders the wand performed said dumbledore nodding in reverse order more would have appeared of course had you maintained the connection very well harry these echoes these shadows what did they doharry described how the figures that had emerged from the wand had prowled the edges of the golden web how voldemort had seemed to fear them how the shadow of harrys mother had told him what to do how cedrics had made its final requestat this point harry found he could not continue he looked around at sirius and saw that he had his face in his handsharry suddenly became aware that fawkes had left his knee the phoenix had fluttered to the floor it was resting its beautiful head against harrys injured leg and thick pearly tears were falling from its eyes onto the wound left by the spider the pain vanished the skin mended his leg was repairedi will say it again said dumbledore as the phoenix rose into the air and resettled itself upon the perch beside the door you have shown bravery beyond anything i could have expected of you tonight harry you have shown bravery equal to those who died fighting voldemort at the height of his powers you have shouldered a grown wizards burden and found yourself equal to it and you have now given us all we have a right to expect you will come with me to the hospital wing i do not want you returning to the dormitory tonight a sleeping potion and some peace sirius would you like to stay with himsirius nodded and stood up he transformed back into the great black dog and walked with harry and dumbledore out of the office accompanying them down a flight of stairs to the hospital wingwhen dumbledore pushed open the door harry saw mrs weasley bill ron and hermione grouped around a harassedlooking madam pomfrey they appeared to be demanding to know where harry was and what had happened to him all of them whipped around as harry dumbledore and the black dog entered and mrs weasley let out a kind of muffled screamharry oh harryshe started to hurry toward him but dumbledore moved between themmolly he said holding up a hand please listen to me for a moment harry has been through a terrible ordeal tonight he has just had to relive it for me what he needs now is sleep and peace and quiet if he would like you all to stay with him he added looking around at ron hermione and bill too you may do so but i do not want you questioning him until he is ready to answer and certainly not this eveningmrs weasley nodded she was very white she rounded on ron hermione and bill as though they were being noisy and hissed did you hear he needs quietheadmaster said madam pomfrey staring at the great black dog that was sirius may i ask what this dog will be remaining with harry for a while said dumbledore simply i assure you he is extremely well trained harry i will wait while you get into bedharry felt an inexpressible sense of gratitude to dumbledore for asking the others not to question him it wasnt as though he didnt want them there but the thought of explaining it all over again the idea of reliving it one more time was more than he could standi will be back to see you as soon as i have met with fudge harry said dumbledore i would like you to remain here tomorrow until i have spoken to the school he leftas madam pomfrey led harry to a nearby bed he caught sight of the real moody lying motionless in a bed at the far end of the room his wooden leg and magical eye were lying on the bedside tableis he okay harry askedhell be fine said madam pomfrey giving harry some pajamas and pulling screens around him he took off his robes pulled on the pajamas and got into bed ron hermione bill mrs weasley and the black dog came around the screen and settled themselves in chairs on either side of him ron and hermione were looking at him almost cautiously as though scared of him im all right he told them just tiredmrs weasleys eyes filled with tears as she smoothed his bedcovers unnecessarilymadam pomfrey who had bustled off to her office returned holding a small bottle of some purple potion and a gobletyoull need to drink all of this harry she said its a potion for dreamless sleepharry took the goblet and drank a few mouthfuls he felt himself becoming drowsy at once everything around him became hazy the lamps around the hospital wing seemed to be winking at him in a friendly way through the screen around his bed his body felt as though it was sinking deeper into the warmth of the feather matress before he could finish the potion before he could say another word his exhaustion had carried him off to sleepharry woke up so warm so very sleepy that he didnt open his eyes wanting to drop off again the room was still dimly lit he was sure it was still nighttime and had a feeling that he couldnt have been asleep very longthen he heard whispering around himtheyll wake him if they dont shut upwhat are they shouting about nothing else can have happened can itharry opened his eyes blearily someone had removed his glasses he could see the fuzzy outlines of mrs weasley and bill close by mrs weasley was on her feetthats fudges voice she whispered and thats minerva mcgonagalls isnt it but what are they arguing aboutnow harry could hear them too people shouting and running toward the hospital wingregrettable but all the same minerva cornelius fudge was saying loudlyyou should never have brought it inside the castle yelled professor mcgonagall when dumbledore finds out harry heard the hospital doors burst open unnoticed by any of the people around his bed all of whom were staring at the door as bill pulled back the screens harry sat up and put his glasses back onfudge came striding up the ward professors mcgonagall and snape were at his heelswheres dumbledore fudge demanded of mrs weasleyhes not here said mrs weasley angrily this is a hospital wing minister dont you think youd do better to but the door opened and dumbledore came sweeping up the wardwhat has happened said dumbledore sharply looking from fudge to professor mcgonagall why are you disturbing these people minerva im surprised at you i asked you to stand guard over barty crouch there is no need to stand guard over him anymore dumbledore she shrieked the minister has seen to thatharry had never seen professor mcgonagall lose control like this there were angry blotches of color in her cheeks and a hands were balled into fists she was trembling with furywhen we told mr fudge that we had caught the death eater responsible for tonights events said snape in a low voice he seemed to feel his personal safety was in question he insisted on summoning a dementor to accompany him into the castle he brought it up to the office where barty crouch i told him you would not agree dumbledore mcgonagall fumed i told him you would never allow dementors to set foot inside the castle but my dear woman roared fudge who likewise looked angrier than harry had ever seen him as minister of magic it is my decision whether i wish to bring protection with me when interviewing a possibly dangerous but professor mcgonagalls voice drowned fudgesthe moment that that thing entered the room she screamed pointing at fudge trembling all over it swooped down on crouch and and harry felt a chill in his stomach as professor mcgonagall struggled to find words to describe what had happened he did not need her to finish her sentence he knew what the dementor must have done it had administered its fatal kiss to barty crouch it had sucked his soul out through his mouth he was worse than deadby all accounts he is no loss blustered fudge it seems he has been responsible for several deathsbut he cannot now give testimony cornelius said dumbledore he was staring hard at fudge as though seeing him plainly for the first time he cannot give evidence about why he killed those peoplewhy he killed them well thats no mystery is it blustered fudge he was a raving lunatic from what minerva and severus have told me he seems to have thought he was doing it all on youknowwhos instructionslord voldemort was giving him instructions cornelius dumbledore said those peoples deaths were mere byproducts of a plan to restore voldemort to full strength again the plan succeeded voldemort has been restored to his bodyfudge looked as though someone had just swung a heavy weight into his face dazed and blinking he stared back at dumbledore as if he couldnt quite believe what he had just heard he began to sputter still goggling at dumbledoreyouknowwho returned preposterous come now dumbledore as minerva and severus have doubtless told you said dumbledore we heard barty crouch confess under the influence of veritaserum he told us how he was smuggled out of azkaban and how voldemort learning of his continued existence from bertha jorkins went to free him from his father and used him to capture harry the plan worked i tell you crouch has helped voldemort to returnsee here dumbledore said fudge and harry was astonished to see a slight smile dawning on his face you you cant seriously believe that youknowwho back come now come now certainly crouch may have believed himself to be acting upon youknowwhos orders but to take the word of a lunatic like that dumbledore when harry touched the triwizard cup tonight he was transported straight to voldemort said dumbledore steadily he witnessed lord voldemorts rebirth i will explain it all to you if you will step up to my officedumbledore glanced around at harry and saw that he was awake but shook his head and said i am afraid i cannot permit you to question harry tonightfudges curious smile lingered he too glanced at harry then looked back at dumbledore and said you are er prepared to take harrys word on this are you dumbledore there was a moments silence which was broken by sirius growling his hackles were raised and he was baring his teeth at fudgecertainly i believe harry said dumbledore his eyes were blazing now i heard crouchs confession and i heard harrys account of what happened after he touched the triwizard cup the two stories make sense they explain everything that has happened since bertha jorkins disappeared last summerfudge still had that strange smile on his face once again he glanced at harry before answeringyou are prepared to believe that lord voldemort has returned on the word of a lunatic murderer and a boy who wellfudge shot harry another look and harry suddenly understoodyouve been reading rita skeeter mr fudge he said quietlyron hermione mrs weasley and bill all jumped none of them had realized that harry was awakefudge reddened slightly but a defiant and obstinate look came over his faceand if i have he said looking at dumbledore if i have discovered that youve been keeping certain facts about the boy very quiet a parselmouth eh and having funny turns all over the place i assume that you are referring to the pains harry has been experiencing in his scar said dumbledore coollyyou admit that he has been having these pains then said fudge quickly headaches nightmares possibly hallucinationslisten to me cornelius said dumbledore taking a step toward fudge and once again he seemed to radiate that indefinable sense of power that harry had felt after dumbledore had stunned young crouch harry is as sane as you or i that scar upon his forehead has not addled his brains i believe it hurts him when lord voldemort is close by or feeling particularly murderousfudge had taken half a step back from dumbledore but he looked no less stubbornyoull forgive me dumbledore but ive never heard of a curse scar acting as an alarm bell before look i saw voldemort come back harry shouted he tried to get out of bed again but mrs weasley forced him back i saw the death eaters i can give you their names lucius malfoy snape made a sudden movement but as harry looked at him snapes eyes flew back to fudgemalfoy was cleared said fudge visibly affronted a very old family donations to excellent causes macnair harry continuedalso cleared now working for the ministryavery nott crabbe goyle you are merely repeating the names of those who were acquitted of being death eaters thirteen years ago said fudge angrily you could have found those names in old reports of the trials for heavens sake dumbledore the boy was full of some crackpot story at the end of last year too his tales are getting taller and youre still swallowing them the boy can talk to snakes dumbledore and you still think hes trustworthy you fool professor mcgonagall cried cedric diggory mr crouch these deaths were not the random work of a lunatic i see no evidence to the contrary shouted fudge now matching her anger his face purpling it seems to me that you are all determined to start a panic that will destabilize everything we have worked for these last thirteen yearsharry couldnt believe what he was hearing he had always thought of fudge as a kindly figure a little blustering a little pompous but essentially goodnatured but now a short angry wizard stood before him refusing pointblank to accept the prospect of disruption in his comfortable and ordered world to believe that voldemort could have risenvoldemort has returned dumbledore repeated if you accept that fact straightaway fudge and take the necessary measures we may still be able to save the situation the first and most essential step is to remove azkaban from the control of the dementors preposterous shouted fudge again remove the dementors id be kicked out of office for suggesting it half of us only feel safe in our beds at night because we know the dementors are standing guard at azkabanthe rest of us sleep less soundly in our beds cornelius knowing that you have put lord voldemorts most dangerous supporters in the care of creatures who will join him the instant he asks them said dumbledore they will not remain loyal to you fudge voldemort can offer them much more scope for their powers and their pleasures than you can with the dementors behind him and his old supporters returned to him you will be hardpressed to stop him regaining the sort of power he had thirteen years agofudge was opening and closing his mouth as though no words could express his outragethe second step you must take and at once dumbledore pressed on is to send envoys to the giantsenvoys to the giants fudge shrieked finding his tongue again what madness is thisextend them the hand of friendship now before it is too late said dumbledore or voldemort will persuade them as he did before that he alone among wizards will give them their rights and their freedomyou you cannot be serious fudge gasped shaking his head and retreating further from dumbledore if the magical community got wind that i had approached the giants people hate them dumbledore end of my career you are blinded said dumbledore his voice rising now the aura of power around him palpable his eyes blazing once more by the love of the office you hold cornelius you place too much importance and you always have done on the socalled purity of blood you fail to recognize that it matters not what someone is born but what they grow to be your dementor has just destroyed the last remaining member of a pureblood family as old as any and see what that man chose to make of his life i tell you now take the steps i have suggested and you will be remembered in office or out as one of the bravest and greatest ministers of magic we have ever known fail to act and history will remember you as the man who stepped aside and allowed voldemort a second chance to destroy the world we have tried to rebuildinsane whispered fudge still backing away mad and then there was silence madam pomfrey was standing frozen at the foot of harrys bed her hands over her mouth mrsweasley was still standing over harry her hand on his shoulder to prevent him from rising bill ron and hermione were staring at fudgeif your determination to shut your eyes will carry you as far as this cornelius said dumbledore we have reached a parting of the ways you must act as you see fit and i i shall act as i see fitdumbledores voice carried no hint of a threat it sounded like a mere statement but fudge bristled as though dumbledore were advancing upon him with a wandnow see here dumbledore he said waving a threatening finger ive given you free rein always ive had a lot of respect for you i might not have agreed with some of your decisions but ive kept quiet there arent many whod have let you hire werewolves or keep hagrid or decide what to teach your students without reference to the ministry but if youre going to work against me the only one against whom i intend to work said dumbledore is lord voldemort if you are against him then we remain cornelius on the same sideit seemed fudge could think of no answer to this he rocked backward and forward on his small feet for a moment and spun his bowler hat in his hands finally he said with a hint of a plea in his voice he cant be back dumbledore he just cant be snape strode forward past dumbledore pulling up the left sleeve of his robes as he went he stuck out his forearm and showed it to fudge who recoiledthere said snape harshly there the dark mark it is not as clear as it was an hour or so ago when it burned black but you can still see it every death eater had the sign burned into him by the dark lord it was a means of distinguishing one another and his means of summoning us to him when he touched the mark of any death eater we were to disapparate and apparate instantly at his side this mark has been growing clearer all year karkaroff s too why do you think karkaroff fled tonight we both felt the mark burn we both knew he had returned karkaroff fears the dark lords vengeance he betrayed too many of his fellow death eaters to be sure of a welcome back into the foldfudge stepped back from snape too he was shaking his head he did not seem to have taken in a word snape had said he stared apparently repelled by the ugly mark on snapes arm then looked up at dumbledore and whispered i dont know what you and your staff are playing at dumbledore but i have heard enough i have no more to add i will be in touch with you tomorrow dumbledore to discuss the running of this school i must return to the ministryhe had almost reached the door when he paused he turned around strode back down the dormitory and stopped at harrys bedyour winnings he said shortly taking a large bag of gold out of his pocket and dropping it onto harrys bedside table one thousand galleons there should have been a presentation ceremony but under the circumstances he crammed his bowler hat onto his head and walked out of the room slamming the door behind him the moment he had disappeared dumbledore turned to look at the group around harrys bedthere is work to be done he said molly am i right in thinking that i can count on you and arthurof course you can said mrs weasley she was white to the lips but she looked resolute we know what fudge is its arthurs fondness for muggles that has held him back at the ministry all these years fudge thinks he lacks proper wizarding pridethen i need to send a message to arthur said dumbledore all those that we can persuade of the truth must be notified immediately and he is well placed to contact those at the ministry who are not as shortsighted as corneliusill go to dad said bill standing up ill go nowexcellent said dumbledore tell him what has happened tell him i will be in direct contact with him shortly he will need to be discreet however if fudge thinks i am interfering at the ministry leave it to me said billhe clapped a hand on harrys shoulder kissed his mother on the cheek pulled on his cloak and strode quickly from the roomminerva said dumbledore turning to professor mcgonagall i want to see hagrid in my office as soon as possible also if she will consent to come madame maximeprofessor mcgonagall nodded and left without a wordpoppy dumbledore said to madam pomfrey would you be very kind and go down to professor moodys office where i think you will find a houseelf called winky in considerable distress do what you can for her and take her back to the kitchens i think dobby will look after her for usvery very well said madam pomfrey looking startled and she too leftdumbledore made sure that the door was closed and that madam pomfreys footsteps had died away before he spoke againand now he said it is time for two of our number to recognize each other for what they are sirius if you could resume your usual formthe great black dog looked up at dumbledore then in an instant turned back into a manmrs weasley screamed and leapt back from the bedsirius black she shrieked pointing at himmum shut up ron yelled its okaysnape had not yelled or jumped backward but the look on his face was one of mingled fury and horrorhim he snarled staring at sirius whose face showed equal dislike what is he doing herehe is here at my invitation said dumbledore looking between them as are you severus i trust you both it is time for you to lay aside your old differences and trust each otherharry thought dumbledore was asking for a near miracle sirius and snape were eyeing each other with the utmost loathingi will settle in the short term said dumbledore with a bite of impatience in his voice for a lack of open hostility you will shake hands you are on the same side now time is short and unless the few of us who know the truth do not stand united there is no hopefor any usvery slowly but still glaring at each other as though each wished the other nothing but ill sirius and snape moved toward each other and shook hands they let go extremely quickly that will do to be going on with said dumbledore stepping between them once more now i have work for each of you fudges attitude though not unexpected changes everything sirius i need you to set off at once you are to alert remus lupin arabella figg mundungus fletcher the old crowd lie low at lupins for a while i will contact you therebut said harryhe wanted sirius to stay he did not want to have to say goodbye again so quicklyyoull see me very soon harry said sirius turning to him i promise you but i must do what i can you understand dont youyeah said harry yeah of course i dosirius grasped his hand briefly nodded to dumbledore transformed again into the black dog and ran the length of the room to the door whose handle he turned with a paw then he was goneseverus said dumbledore turning to snape you know what i must ask you to do if you are ready if you are prepared i am said snapehe looked slightly paler than usual and his cold black eyes glittered strangelythen good luck said dumbledore and he watched with a trace of apprehension on his face as snape swept wordlessly after siriusit was several minutes before dumbledore spoke againi must go downstairs he said finally i must see the diggorys harry take the rest of your potion i will see all of you laterharry slumped back against his pillows as dumbledore disappeared hermione ron and mrs weasley were all looking at him none of them spoke for a very long timeyouve got to take the rest of your potion harry mrs weasley said at last her hand nudged the sack of gold on his bedside cabinet as she reached for the bottle and the goblet you have a good long sleep try and think about something else for a while think about what youre going to buy with your winningsi dont want that gold said harry in an expressionless voice you have it anyone can have it i shouldnt have won it it shouldve been cedricsthe thing against which he had been fighting on and off ever since he had come out of the maze was threatening to overpower him he could feel a burning prickling feeling in the inner corners of his eyes he blinked and stared up at the ceilingit wasnt your fault harry mrs weasley whisperedi told him to take the cup with me said harrynow the burning feeling was in his throat too he wished ron would look awaymrs weasley set the potion down on the bedside cabinet bent down and put her arms around harry he had no memory of ever being hugged like this as though by a mother the full weight of everything he had seen that night seemed to fall in upon him as mrs weasley held him to her his mother s face his fathers voice the sight of cedric dead on the ground all started spinning in his head until he could hardly bear it until he was screwing up his face against the howl of misery fighting to get out of himthere was a loud slamming noise and mrs weasley and harry broke apart hermione was standing by the window she was holding something tight in her handsorry she whisperedyour potion harry said mrs weasley quickly wiping her eyes on the back of her handharry drank it in one gulp the effect was instantaneous heavy irresistible waves of dreamless sleep broke over him he fell back onto his pillows and thought no morechapter thirtyseven the beginningwhen he looked back even a month later harry found he had only scattered memories of the next few days it was as though he had been through too much to take in any more the recollections he did have were very painful the worst perhaps was the meeting with the diggorys that took place the following morningthey did not blame him for what had happened on the contrary both thanked him for returning cedrics body to them mr diggory sobbed through most of the interview mrs diggorys grief seemed to be beyond tearshe suffered very little then she said when harry had told her how cedric had died and after all amos he died just when hed won the tournament he must have been happywhen they got to their feet she looked down at harry and said you look after yourself nowharry seized the sack of gold on the bedside tableyou take this he muttered to her it shouldve been cedrics he got there first you take it but she backed away from himoh no its yours dear i couldnt you keep itharry returned to gryffindor tower the following evening from what hermione and ron told him dumbledore had spoken to the school that morning at breakfast he had merely requested that they leave harry alone that nobody ask him questions or badger him to tell the story of what had happened in the maze most people he noticed were skirting him in the corridors avoiding his eyes some whispered behind their hands as he passed he guessed that many of them had believed rita skeeters article about how disturbed and possibly dangerous he was perhaps they were formulating their own theories about how cedric had died he found he didnt care very much he liked it best when he was with ron and hermione and they were talking about other things or else letting him sit in silence while they played chess he felt as though all three of them had reached an understanding they didnt need to put into words that each was waiting for some sign some word of what was going on outside hogwarts and that it was useless to speculate about what might be coming until they knew anything for certain the only time they touched upon the subject was when ron told harry about a meeting mrs weasley had had with dumbledore before going homeshe went to ask him if you could come straight to us this summer he said but he wants you to go back to the dursleys at least at firstwhy said harryshe said dumbledores got his reasons said ron shaking his head darkly i suppose weve got to trust him havent wethe only person apart from ron and hermione that harry felt able to talk to was hagrid as there was no longer a defense against the dark arts teacher they had those lessons free they used the one on thursday afternoon to go down and visit hagrid in his cabin it was a bright and sunny day fang bounded out of the open door as they approached barking and wagging his tail madlywhos that called hagrid coming to the door harryhe strode out to meet them pulled harry into a onearmed hug ruffled his hair and said good ter see yeh mate good ter see yehthey saw two bucketsize cups and saucers on the wooden table in front of the fireplace when they entered hagrids cabinbin havin a cuppa with olympe hagrid said shes jus leftwho said ron curiouslymadame maxime o course said hagridyou two made up have you said rondunno what yehre talkin about said hagrid airily fetching more cups from the dresser when he had

bidin his time it had ter happen well now it has an well jus have ter get on with it well fight migh be able ter stop him before he gets a good hold thats dumbledores plan anyway great man dumbledore s long as weve got him im not too worriedhagrid raised his bushy eyebrows at the disbelieving expressions on their facesno good sittin worryin abou it he said whats comin will come an well meet it when it does dumbledore told me wha you did harryhagrids chest swelled as he looked at harryyeh did as much as yer father wouldve done an i can give yeh no higher praise than thatharry smiled back at him it was the first time hed smiled in days whats dumbledore asked you to do hagrid he asked he sent professor mcgonagall to ask you and madame maxime to meet him that nightgot a little job fer me over the summer said hagrid secret though im not spposed ter talk abou it no not even ter you lot olympe madame maxime ter you might be comin with me i think she will think i got her persuadedis it to do with voldemorthagrid flinched at the sound of the namemigh be he said evasively now whod like ter come an visit the las skrewt with me i was jokin jokin he added hastily seeing the looks on their facesit was with a heavy heart that harry packed his trunk up in the dormitory on the night before his return to privet drive he was dreading the leaving feast which was usually a cause for celebration when the winner of the interhouse championship would be announced he had avoided being in the great hall when it was full ever since he had left the hospital wing preferring to eat when it was nearly empty to avoid the stares of his fellow studentswhen he ron and hermione entered the hall they saw at once that the usual decorations were missing the great hall was normally decorated with the winning houses colors for the leaving feast tonight however there were black drapes on the wall behind the teachers table harry knew instantly that they were there as a mark of respect to cedricthe real madeye moody was at the staff table now his wooden leg and his magical eye back in place he was extremely twitchy jumping every time someone spoke to him harry couldnt blame him moodys fear of attack was bound to have been increased by his tenmonth imprisonment in his own trunk professor karkaroff s chair was empty harry wondered as he sat down with the other gryffindors where karkaroff was now and whether voldemort had caught up with himmadame maxime was still there she was sitting next to hagrid they were talking quietly together further along the table sitting next to professor mcgonagall was snape his eyes lingered on harry for a moment as harry looked at him his expression was difficult to read he looked as sour and unpleasant as ever harry continued to watch him long after snape had looked awaywhat was it that snape had done on dumbledores orders the night that voldemort had returned and why why was dumbledore so convinced that snape was truly on their side he had been their spy dumbledore had said so in the pensieve snape had turned spy against voldemort at great personal risk was that the job he had taken up again had he made contact with the death eaters perhaps pretended that he had never really gone over to dumbledore that he had been like voldemort himself biding his timeharrys musings were ended by professor dumbledore who stood up at the staff table the great hall which in any case had been less noisy than it usually was at the leaving feast became very quietthe end said dumbledore looking around at them all of another yearhe paused and his eyes fell upon the hufflepuff table theirs had been the most subdued table before he had gotten to his feet and theirs were still the saddest and palest faces in the hallthere is much that i would like to say to you all tonight said dumbledore but i must first acknowledge the loss of a very fine person who should be sitting here he gestured toward the hufflepuffs enjoying our feast with us i would like you all please to stand and raise your glasses to cedric diggorythey did it all of them the benches scraped as everyone in the hall stood and raised their goblets and echoed in one loud low rumbling voice cedric diggoryharry caught a glimpse of cho through the crowd there were tears pouring silently down her face he looked down at the table as they all sat down againcedric was a person who exemplified many of the qualities that distinguish hufflepuff house dumbledore continued he was a good and loyal friend a hard worker he valued fair play his death has affected you all whether you knew him well or not i think that you have the right therefore to know exactly how it came aboutharry raised his head and stared at dumbledorecedric diggory was murdered by lord voldemorta panicked whisper swept the great hall people were staring at dumbledore in disbelief in horror he looked perfectly calm as he watched them mutter themselves into silencethe ministry of magic dumbledore continued does not wish me to tell you this it is possible that some of your parents will be horrified that i have done so either because they will not believe that lord voldemort has returned or because they think i should not tell you so young as you are it is my belief however that the truth is generally preferable to lies and that any attempt to pretend that cedric died as the result of an accident or some sort of blunder of his own is an insult to his memorystunned and frightened every face in the hall was turned toward dumbledore now or almost every face over at the slytherin table harry saw draco malfoy muttering something to crabbe and goyle harry felt a hot sick swoop of anger in his stomach he forced himself to look back at dumbledorethere is somebody else who must be mentioned in connection with cedrics death dumbledore went on i am talking of course about harry pottera kind of ripple crossed the great hall as a few heads turned in harrys direction before flicking back to face dumbledoreharry potter managed to escape lord voldemort said dumbledore he risked his own life to return cedrics body to hogwarts he showed in every respect the sort of bravery that few wizards have ever shown in facing lord voldemort and for this i honor himdumbledore turned gravely to harry and raised his goblet once more nearly everyone in the great hall followed suit they murmured his name as they had murmured cedrics and drank to him but through a gap in the standing figures harry saw that malfoy crabbe goyle and many of the other slytherins had remained defiantly in their seats their goblets untouched dumbledore who after all possessed no magical eye did not see themwhen everyone had once again resumed their seats dumbledore continued the triwizard tournaments aim was to further and promote magical understanding in the light of what has happened of lord voldemorts return such ties are more important than ever beforedumbledore looked from madame maxime and hagrid to fleur delacour and her fellow beauxbatons students to viktor krum and the durmstrangs at the slytherin table krum harry saw looked wary almost frightened as though he expected dumbledore to say something harshevery guest in this hall said dumbledore and his eyes lingered upon the durmstrang students will be welcomed back here at any time should they wish to come i say to you all once again in the light of lord voldemorts return we are only as strong as we are united as weak as we are divided lord voldemorts gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great we can fight it only by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust differences of habit and language are nothing at all if our aims are identical and our hearts are openit is my belief and never have i so hoped that i am mistaken that we are all facing dark and difficult times some of you in this hall have already suffered directly at the hands of lord voldemort many of your families have been torn asunder a week ago a student was taken from our midstremember cedric remember if the time should come when you have to make a choice between what is right and what is easy remember what happened to a boy who was good and kind and brave because he strayed across the path of lord voldemort remember cedric diggoryharrys trunk was packed hedwig was back in her cage on top of it he ron and hermione were waiting in the crowded entrance hall with the rest of the fourth years for the carriages that would take them back to hogsmeade station it was another beautiful summers day he supposed that privet drive would be hot and leafy its flower beds a riot of color when he arrived there that evening the thought gave him no pleasure at allarryhe looked around fleur delacour was hurrying up the stone steps into the castle beyond her far across the grounds harry could see hagrid helping madame maxime to back two of the giant horses into their harness the beauxbatons carriage was about to take offwe will see each uzzer again i ope said fleur as she reached him holding out her hand i am oping to get a job ere to improve my eenglishits very good already said ron in a strangled sort of voice fleur smiled at him hermione scowledgoodbye arry said fleur turning to go it az been a pleasure meeting youharrys spirits couldnt help but lift slightly as he watched fleur hurry back across the lawns to madame maxime her silvery hair rippling in the sunlightwonder how the durmstrang students are getting back said ron d you reckon they can steer that ship without karkaroffkarkaroff did not steer said a gruff voice he stayed in his cabin and let us do the vorkkrum had come to say goodbye to hermione could i have a vord he asked heroh yes all right said hermione looking slightly flustered and following krum through the crowd and out of sightyoud better hurry up ron called loudly after her the carriagesll be here in a minutehe let harry keep a watch for the carriages however and spent the next few minutes craning his neck over the crowd to try and see what krum and hermione might be up to they returned quite soon ron stared at hermione but her face was quite impassivei liked diggory said krum abruptly to harry he vos alvays polite to me alvays even though i vos from durmstrang with karkaroff he added scowlinghave you got a new headmaster yet said harrykrum shrugged he held out his hand as fleur had done shook harrys hand and then rons ron looked as though he was suffering some sort of painful internal struggle krum had already started walking away when ron burst out can i have your autographhermione turned away smiling at the horseless carriages that were now trundling toward them up the drive as krum looking surprised but gratified signed a fragment of parchment for ronthe weather could not have been more different on the journey back to kings cross than it had been on their way to hogwarts the previous september there wasnt a single cloud in the sky harry ron and hermione had managed to get a compartment to themselves pigwidgeon was once again hidden under rons dress robes to stop him from hooting continually hedwig was dozing her head under her wing and crookshanks was curled up in a spare seat like a large furry ginger cushion harry ron and hermione talked more fully and freely than they had all week as the train sped them southward harry felt as though dumbledores speech at the leaving feast had unblocked him somehow it was less painful to discuss what had happened now they broke off their conversation about what action dumbledore might be taking even now to stop voldemort only when the lunch trolley arrivedwhen hermione returned from the trolley and put her money back into her schoolbag she dislodged a copy of the daily prophet that she had been carrying in there harry looked at it unsure whether he really wanted to know what it might say but hermione seeing him looking at it said calmly theres nothing in there you can look for yourself but theres nothing at all ive been checking every day just a small piece the day after the third task saying you won the tournament they didnt even mention cedric nothing about any of it if you ask me fudge is forcing them to keep quiethell never keep rita quiet said harry not on a story like thisoh rita hasnt written anything at all since the third task said hermione in an oddly constrained voice as a matter of fact she added her voice now trembling slightly rita skeeter isnt going to be writing anything at all for a while not unless she wants me to spill the beans on herwhat are you talking about said roni found out how she was listening in on private conversations when she wasnt supposed to be coming onto the grounds said hermione in a rushharry had the impression that hermione had been dying to tell them this for days but that she had restrained herself in light of everything else that had happenedhow was she doing it said harry at oncehow did you find out said ron staring at herwell it was you really who gave me the idea harry she saiddid i said harry perplexed howbugging said hermione happilybut you said they didnt work oh not electronic bugs said hermione no you see rita skeeter hermiones voice trembled with quiet triumph is an unregistered animagus she can turn hermione pulled a small sealed glass jar out other baginto a beetleyoure kidding said ron you havent shes notoh yes she is said hermione happily brandishing the jar at theminside were a few twigs and leaves and one large fat beetlethats never youre kidding ron whispered lifting the jar to his eyesno im not said hermione beaming i caught her on the windowsill in the hospital wing look very closely and youll notice the markings around her antennae are exactly like those foul glasses she wearsharry looked and saw that she was quite right he also remembered somethingthere was a beetle on the statue the night we heard hagrid telling madame maxime about his mumexactly said hermione and viktor pulled a beetle out of my hair after wed had our conversation by the lake and unless im very much mistaken rita was perched on the windowsill of the divination class the day your scar hurt shes been buzzing around for stories all yearwhen we saw malfoy under that tree said ron slowlyhe was talking to her in his hand said hermione he knew of course thats how shes been getting all those nice little interviews with the slytherins they wouldnt care that she was doing something illegal as long as they were giving her horrible stuff about us and hagridhermione took the glass jar back from ron and smiled at the beetle which buzzed angrily against the glassive told her ill let her out when we get back to london said hermione ive put an unbreakable charm on the jar you see so she cant transform and ive told her shes to keep her quill to herself for a whole year see if she cant break the habit of writing horrible lies about peoplesmiling serenely hermione placed the beetle back inside her schoolbagthe door of the compartment slid openvery clever granger said draco malfoycrabbe and goyle were standing behind him all three of them looked more pleased with themselves more arrogant and more menacing than harry had ever seen themso said malfoy slowly advancing slightly into the compartment and looking slowly around at them a smirk quivering on his lips you caught some pathetic reporter and potters dumbledores favorite boy again big dealhis smirk widened crabbe and goyle leeredtrying not to think about it are we said malfoy softly looking around at all three of them trying to pretend it hasnt happenedget out said harryhe had not been this close to malfoy since he had watched him muttering to crabbe and goyle during dumbledores speech about cedric he could feel a kind of ringing in his ears his hand gripped his wand under his robesyouve picked the losing side potter i warned you i told you you ought to choose your company more carefully remember when we met on the train first day at hogwarts i told you not to hang around with riffraff like this he jerked his head at ron and hermione too late now potter theyll be the first to go now the dark lords back mudbloods and mugglelovers first well second diggory was the fit was as though someone had exploded a box of fireworks within the compartment blinded by the blaze of the spells that had blasted from every direction deafened by a series of bangs harry blinked and looked down at the floormalfoy crabbe and goyle were all lying unconscious in the doorway he ron and hermione were on their feet all three of them having used a different hex nor were they the only ones to have done sothought wed see what those three were up to said fred matteroffactly stepping onto goyle and into the compartment he had his wand out and so did george who was careful to tread on malfoy as he followed fred insideinteresting effect said george looking down at crabbe who used the furnunculus curseme said harryodd said george lightly i used jellylegs looks as though those two shouldnt be mixed he seems to have sprouted little tentacles all over his face well lets not leave them here they dont add much to the decorron harry and george kicked rolled and pushed the unconscious malfoy crabbe and goyle each of whom looked distinctly the worse for the jumble of jinxes with which they had been hit out into the corridor then came back into the compartment and rolled the door shutexploding snap anyone said fred pulling out a pack of cardsthey were halfway through their fifth game when harry decided to ask themyou going to tell us then he said to george who you were blackmailingoh said george darkly thatit doesnt matter said fred shaking his head impatiently it wasnt anything important not now anywayweve given up said george shruggingbut harry ron and hermione kept on asking and finally fred said all right all right if you really want to know it was ludo bagmanbagman said harry sharply are you saying he was involved in nah said george gloomily nothing like that stupid git he wouldnt have the brainswell what then said ronfred hesitated then said you remember that bet we had with him at the quidditch world cup about how ireland would win but krum would get the snitchyeah said harry and ron slowlywell the git paid us in leprechaun gold hed caught from the irish mascotssoso said fred impatiently it vanished didnt it by next morning it had gonebut it mustve been an accident mustnt it said hermionegeorge laughed very bitterlyyeah thats what we thought at first we thought if we just wrote to him and told him hed made a mistake hed cough up but nothing doing ignored our letter we kept trying to talk to him about it at hogwarts but he was always making some excuse to get away from usin the end he turned pretty nasty said fred told us we were too young to gamble and he wasnt giving us anythingso we asked for our money back said george gloweringhe didnt refuse gasped hermioneright in one said fredbut that was all your savings said rontell me about it said george course we found out what was going on in the end lee jordans dad had had a bit of trouble getting money off bagman as well turns out hes in big trouble with the goblins borrowed loads of gold off them a gang of them cornered him in the woods after the world cup and took all the gold he had and it still wasnt enough to cover all his debts they followed him all the way to hogwarts to keep an eye on him hes lost everything gambling hasnt got two galleons to rub together and you know how the idiot tried to pay the goblins backhow said harryhe put a bet on you mate said fred put a big bet on you to win the tournament bet against the goblinsso thats why he kept trying to help me win said harry well i did win didnt i so he can pay you your goldnope said george shaking his head the goblins play as dirty as him they say you drew with diggory and bagman was betting youd win outright so bagman had to run for it he did run for it right after the third taskgeorge sighed deeply and started dealing out the cards againthe rest of the journey passed pleasantly enough harry wished it could have gone on all summer in fact and that he would never arrive at kings cross but as he had learned the hard way that year time will not slow down when something unpleasant lies ahead and all too soon the hogwarts express was pulling in at platform nine and threequarters the usual confusion and noise filled the corridors as the students began to disembark ron and hermione struggled out past malfoy crabbe and goyle carrying their trunks harry however stayed putfred george wait a momentthe twins turned harry pulled open his trunk and drew out his triwizard winningstake it he said and he thrust the sack into georges handswhat said fred looking flabbergastedtake it harry repeated firmly i dont want ityoure mental said george trying to push it back at harryno im not said harry you take it and get inventing its for the joke shophe is mental fred said in an almost awed voicelisten said harry firmly if you dont take it im throwing it down the drain i dont want it and i dont need it but i could do with a few laughs we could all do with a few laughs ive got a feeling were going to need them more than usual before longharry said george weakly weighing the money bag in his hands theres got to be a thousand galleons in hereyeah said harry grinning think how many canary creams that isthe twins stared at himjust dont tell your mum where you got it although she might not be so keen for you to join the ministry anymore come to think of it harry fred began but harry pulled out his wandlook he said flatly take it or ill hex you i know some good ones now just do me one favor okay buy ron some different dress robes and say theyre from youhe left the compartment before they could say another word stepping over malfoy crabbe and goyle who were still lying on the floor covered in hex marksuncle vernon was waiting beyond the barrier mrs weasley was close by him she hugged harry very tightly when she saw him and whispered in his ear i think dumbledore will let you come to us later in the summer keep in touch harrysee you harry said ron clapping him on the backbye harry said hermione and she did something she had never done before and kissed him on the cheekharry thanks george muttered while fred nodded fervently at his sideharry winked at them turned to uncle vernon and followed him silently from the station there was no point worrying yet he told himself as he got into the back of the dursleys caras hagrid had said what would come would come and he would have to meet it when it didharry potter and the order of the phoenixj k rowlingchapter one dudley dementedthe hottest day of the summer so far was drawing to a close and a drowsy silence lay over the large square houses of privet drive cars that were usually gleaming stood dusty in their drives and lawns that were once emerald green lay parched and yellowing for the use of hosepipes had been banned due to drought deprived of their usual carwashing and lawnmowing pursuits the inhabitants of privet drive had retreated into the shade of their cool houses windows thrown wide in the hope of tempting in a nonexistent breeze the only person left outdoors was a teenage boy who was lying flat on his back in a flowerbed outside number fourhe was a skinny blackhaired bespectacled boy who had the pinched slightly unhealthy look of someone who has grown a lot in a short space of time his jeans were torn and dirty his tshirt baggy and faded and the soles of his trainers were peeling away from the uppers harry potters appearance did not endear him to the neighbours who were the sort of people who thought scruffiness ought to be punishable by law but as he had hidden himself behind a large hydrangea bush this evening he was quite invisible to passersby in fact the only way he would be spotted was if his uncle vernon or aunt petunia stuck their heads out of the livingroom window and looked straight down into the flowerbed belowon the whole harry thought he was to be congratulated on his idea of hiding here he was not perhaps very comfortable lying on the hot hard earth but on the other hand nobody was glaring at him grinding their teeth so loudly that he could not hear the news or shooting nasty questions at him as had happened every time he had tried sitting down in the living room to watch television with his aunt and unclealmost as though this thought had fluttered through the open window vernon dursley harrys uncle suddenly spokeglad to see the boys stopped trying to butt in where is he anywayi dont know said aunt petunia unconcerned not in the houseuncle vernon gruntedwatching the news he said scathingly id like to know what hes really up to as if a normal boy cares whats on the news dudley hasnt got a clue whats going on doubt he knows who the prime minister is anyway its not as if thered be anything about his lot on our news vernon shh said aunt petunia the windows openoh yes sorry dearthe dursleys fell silent harry listened to a jingle about fruit n bran breakfast cereal while he watched mrs figg a batty catloving old lady from nearby wisteria walk amble slowly past she was frowning and muttering to herself harry was very pleased he was concealed behind the bush as mrs figg had recently taken to asking him round for tea whenever she met him in the street she had rounded the corner and vanished from view before uncle vernons voice floated out of the window againdudders out for teaat the polkisses said aunt petunia fondly hes got so many little friends hes so popular harry suppressed a snort with difficulty the dursleys really were astonishingly stupid about their son dudley they had swallowed all his dimwitted lies about having tea with a different member of his gang every night of the summer holidays harry knew perfectly well that dudley had not been to tea anywhere he and his gang spent every evening vandalising the play park smoking on street corners and throwing stones at passing cars and children harry had seen them at it during his evening walks around little whinging he had spent most of the holidays wandering the streets scavenging newspapers from bins along the waythe opening notes of the music that heralded the seven oclock news reached harrys ears and his stomach turned over perhaps tonight after a month of waiting would be the nightrecord numbers of stranded holidaymakers fill airports as the spanish baggagehandlers strike reaches its second week give em a lifelong siesta i would snarled uncle vernon over the end of the newsreaders sentence but no matter outside in the flowerbed harrys stomach seemed to unclench if anything had happened it would surely have been the first item on the news death and destruction were more important than stranded holidaymakershe let out a long slow breath and stared up at the brilliant blue sky every day this summer had been the same the tension the expectation the temporary relief and then mounting tension again and always growing more insistent all the time the question of why nothing had happened yethe kept listening just in case there was some small clue not recognised for what it really was by the muggles an unexplained disappearance perhaps or some strange accident but the baggagehandlers strike was followed by news about the drought in the southeast i hope hes listening next door bellowed uncle vernon him with his sprinklers on at three in the morning then a helicopter that had almost crashed in a field in surrey then a famous actresss divorce from her famous husband as if were interested in their sordid affairs sniffed aunt petunia who had followed the case obsessively in every magazine she could lay her bony hands onharry closed his eyes against the now blazing evening sky as the newsreader said and finally bungy the budgie has found a novel way of keeping cool this summer bungy who lives at the five feathers in barnsley has learned to water ski mary dorkins went to find out moreharry opened his eyes if they had reached waterskiing budgerigars there would be nothing else worth hearing he rolled cautiously on to his front and raised himself on to his knees and elbows preparing to crawl out from under the windowhe had moved about two inches when several things happened in very quick successiona loud echoing crack broke the sleepy silence like a gunshot a cat streaked out from under a parked car and flew out of sight a shriek a bellowed oath and the sound of breaking china came from the dursleys living room and as though this was the signal harry had been waiting for he jumped to his feet at the same time pulling from the waistband of his jeans a thin wooden wand as if he were unsheathing a sword but before he could draw himself up to full height the top of his head collided with the dursleys open window the resultant crash made aunt petunia scream even louderharry felt as though his head had been split in two eyes streaming he swayed trying to focus on the street to spot the source of the noise but he had barely staggered upright when two large purple hands reached through the open window and closed tightly around his throatput it away uncle vernon snarled into harrys ear now before anyone seesget off me harry gasped for a few seconds they struggled harry pulling at his uncles sausagelike fingers with his left hand his right maintaining a firm grip on his raised wand then as the pain in the top of harrys head gave a particularly nasty throb uncle vernon yelped and released harry as though he had received an electric shock some invisible force seemed to have surged through his nephew making him impossible to holdpanting harry fell forwards over the hydrangea bush straightened up and stared around there was no sign of what had caused the loud cracking noise but there were several faces peering through various nearby windows harry stuffed his wand hastily back into his jeans and tried to look innocentlovely evening shouted uncle vernon waving at mrs number seven opposite who was glaring from behind her net curtains did you hear that car backfire just now gave petunia and me quite a turnhe continued to grin in a horrible manic way until all the curious neighbours had disappeared from their various windows then the grin became a grimace of rage as he beckoned harry back towards himharry moved a few steps closer taking care to stop just short of the point at which uncle vernons outstretched hands could resume their stranglingwhat the devil do you mean by it boy asked uncle vernon in a croaky voice that trembled with furywhat do i mean by what said harry coldly he kept looking left and right up the street still hoping to see the person who had made the cracking noisemaking a racket like a starting pistol right outside our i didnt make that noise said harry firmlyaunt petunias thin horsy face now appeared beside uncle vernons wide purple one she looked lividwhy were you lurking under our windowyes yes good point petunia what were you doing under our window boylistening to the news said harry in a resigned voicehis aunt and uncle exchanged looks of outragelistening to the news againwell it changes every day you see said harrydont you be clever with me boy i want to know what youre really up to and dont give me any more of this listening to the news tosh you know perfectly well that your lot careful vernon breathed aunt petunia and uncle vernon lowered his voice so that harry could barely hear him that your lot dont get on our newsthats all you know said harrythe dursleys goggled at him for a few seconds then aunt petunia said youre a nasty little liar what are all those she too lowered her voice so that harry had to lipread the next word owls doing if theyre not bringing you newsaha said uncle vernon in a triumphant whisper get out of that one boy as if we didnt know you get all your news from those pestilential birdsharry hesitated for a moment it cost him something to tell the truth this time even though his aunt and uncle could not possibly know how bad he felt at admitting itthe owls arent bringing me news he said tonelesslyi dont believe it said aunt petunia at onceno more do i said uncle vernon forcefullywe know youre up to something funny said aunt petuniawere not stupid you know said uncle vernonwell thats news to me said harry his temper rising and before the dursleys could call him back he had wheeled about crossed the front lawn stepped over the low garden wall and was striding off up the streethe was in trouble now and he knew it he would have to face his aunt and uncle later and pay the price for his rudeness but he did not care very much just at the moment he had much more pressing matters on his mindharry was sure the cracking noise had been made by someone apparating or disapparating it was exactly the sound dobby the houseelf made when he vanished into thin air was it possible that dobby was here in privet drive could dobby be following him right at this very moment as this thought occurred he wheeled around and stared back down privet drive but it appeared to be completely deserted and harry was sure that dobby did not know how to become invisiblehe walked on hardly aware of the route he was taking for he had pounded these streets so often lately that his feet carried him to his favourite haunts automatically every few steps he glanced back over his shoulder someone magical had been near him as he lay among aunt petunias dying begonias he was sure of it why hadnt they spoken to him why hadnt they made contact why were they hiding nowand then as his feeling of frustration peaked his certainty leaked awayperhaps it hadnt been a magical sound after all perhaps he was so desperate for the tiniest sign of contact from the world to which he belonged that he was simply overreacting to perfectly ordinary noises could he be sure it hadnt been the sound of something breaking inside a neighbours househarry felt a dull sinking sensation in his stomach and before he knew it the feeling of hopelessness that had plagued him all summer rolled over him once againtomorrow morning he would be woken by the alarm at five oclock so he could pay the owl that delivered the daily prophet but was there any point continuing to take it harry merely glanced at the front page before throwing it aside these days when the idiots who ran the paper finally realised that voldemort was back it would be headline news and that was the only kind harry cared aboutif he was lucky there would also be owls carrying letters from his best friends ron and hermione though any expectation hed had that their letters would bring him news had long since been dashedwe cant say much about youknowwhat obviously weve been told not to say anything important in case our letters go astray were quite busy but i cant give you details here theres a fair amount going on well tell you everything when we see you but when were they going to see him nobody seemed too bothered with a precise date hermione had scribbled i expect well be seeing you quite soon inside his birthday card but how soon was soon as far as harry could tell from the vague hints in their letters hermione and ron were in the same place presumably at rons parents house he could hardly bear to think of the pair of them having fun at the burrow when he was stuck in privet drive in fact he was so angry with them he had thrown away unopened the two boxes of honeydukes chocolates theyd sent him for his birthday hed regretted it later after the wilted salad aunt petunia had provided for dinner that nightand what were ron and hermione busy with why wasnt he harry busy hadnt he proved himself capable of handling much more than them had they all forgotten what he had done hadnt it been he who had entered that graveyard and watched cedric being murdered and been tied to that tombstone and nearly killeddont think about that harry told himself sternly for the hundredth time that summer it was bad enough that he kept revisiting the graveyard in his nightmares without dwelling on it in his waking moments toohe turned a corner into magnolia crescent halfway along he passed the narrow alleyway down the side of a garage where he had first clapped eyes on his godfather sirius at least seemed to understand how harry was feeling admittedly his letters were just as empty of proper news as ron and hermiones but at least they contained words of caution and consolation instead of tantalising hints i know this must be frustrating for you keep your nose clean and everything will be ok be careful and dont do anything rash well thought harry as he crossed magnolia crescent turned into magnolia road and headed towards the darkening play park he had by and large done as sirius advised he had at least resisted the temptation to tie his trunk to his broomstick and set off for the burrow by himself in fact harry thought his behaviour had been very good considering how frustrated and angry he felt at being stuck in privet drive so long reduced to hiding in flowerbeds in the hope of hearing something that might point to what lord voldemort was doing nevertheless it was quite galling to be told not to be rash by a man who had served twelve years in the wizard prison azkaban escaped attempted to commit the murder he had been convicted for in the first place then gone on the run with a stolen hippogriffharry vaulted over the locked park gate and set off across the parched grass the park was as empty as the surrounding streets when he reached the swings he sank on to the only one that dudley and his friends had not yet managed to break coiled one arm around the chain and stared moodily at the ground he would not be able to hide in the dursleys flowerbed again tomorrow he would have to think of some fresh way of listening to the news in the meantime he had nothing to look forward to but another restless disturbed night because even when he escaped the nightmares about cedric he had unsettling dreams about long dark corridors all finishing in dead ends and locked doors which he supposed had something to do with the trapped feeling he had when he was awake often the old scar on his forehead prickled uncomfortably but he did not fool himself that ron or hermione or sirius would find that very interesting any more in the past his scar hurting had warned that voldemort was getting stronger again but now that voldemort was back they would probably remind him that its regular irritation was only to be expected nothing to worry about old news the injustice of it all welled up inside him so that he wanted to yell with fury if it hadnt been for him nobody would even have known voldemort was back and his reward was to be stuck in little whinging for four solid weeks completely cut off from the magical world reduced to squatting among dying begonias so hat he could hear about waterskiing budgerigars how could dumbledore have forgotten him so easily why had ron and hermione got together without inviting him along too how much longer was he supposed to endure sirius telling him to sit tight and be a good boy or resist the temptation to write to the stupid daily prophet and point out that voldemort had returned these curious thoughts whirled around in harrys head and his insides writhed with anger as a sultry velvety night fell around him the air full of the smell of warm dry grass and the only sound that of the low grumble of traffic on the road beyond the park railings he did not know how long he had sat on the swing before the sound of voices interrupted his musings and he looked up the streetlamps from the surrounding roads were casting a misty glow strong enough to silhouette a group of people making their way across the park one of them was singing a loud crude song the others were laughing a soft ticking noise came from several expensive racing bikes that they were wheeling alongharry knew who those people were the figure in front was unmistakeably his cousin dudley dursley wending his way home accompanied by his faithful gangdudley was as vast as ever but a years hard dieting and the discovery of a new talent had wrought quite a change in his physique as uncle vernon delightedly told anyone who would listen dudley had recently become the junior heavyweight interschool boxing champion of the southeast the noble sport as uncle vernon called it had made dudley even more formidable than he had seemed to harry in their primary school days when he had served as dudleys first punchball harry was not remotely afraid of his cousin any more but he still didnt think that dudley earning to punch harder and more accurately was cause for celebration neighbourhood children all around were terrified of him even more terrified than they were of that potter boy who they lad been warned was a hardened hooligan and attended st brutuss secure centre for incurably criminal boysharry watched the dark figures crossing the grass and wondered who they had been beating up tonight look round harry found himself thinking as he watched them come on look round im sitting here all alone come and have a go if dudleys friends saw him sitting here they would be sure to make a beeline for him and what would dudley do then he wouldnt want to lose face in front of the gang but hed be terrified of provoking harry it would be really fun to watch dudleys dilemma to taunt him watch him with him powerless to respond and if any of the others tried hitting harry he was ready he had his wand let them try hed love to vent some of his frustration on the boys who had once made his life hellbut they didnt turn around they didnt see him they were almost at the railings harry mastered the impulse to call after them seeking a fight was not a smart move he must not use magic he would be risking expulsion againthe voices of dudleys gang died away they were out of sight heading along magnolia roadthere you go sirius harry thought dully nothing rash kept my nose clean exactly the opposite of what youd have donehe got to his feet and stretched aunt petunia and uncle vernon seemed to feel that whenever dudley turned up was the right time to be home and any time after that was much too late uncle vernon had threatened to lock harry in the shed if he came home alter dudley ever again so stifling a yawn and still scowling harry set off towards the park gatemagnolia road like privet drive was full of large square houses with perfectly manicured lawns all owned by large square owners who drove very clean cars similar to uncle vernons harry preferred little whinging by night when the curtained windows made patches of jewelbright colour in the darkness and he ran no danger of hearing disapproving mutters about his delinquent appearance when he passed the householders he walked quickly so that halfway along magnolia road dudleys gang came into view again they were saying their farewells at the entrance to magnolia crescent harry stepped into the shadow of a large lilac tree and waitedsquealed like a pig didnt he malcolm was saying to guffaws

to know how furious he was making dudley he felt as though he was siphoning off his own frustration into his cousin the only outlet he hadthey turned right down the narrow alleyway where harry had first seen sirius and which formed a short cut between magnolia crescent and wisteria walk it was empty and much darker than the streets it linked because there were no streetlamps their footsteps were muffled between garage walls on one side and a high fence on the otherthink youre a big man carrying that thing dont you dudley said after a few secondswhat thingthat that thing you are hidingharry grinned againnot as stupid as you look are you dud but i spose if you were you wouldnt be able to walk and talk at the same timeharry pulled out his wand he saw dudley look sideways at

supposed to be frightened of pillows or somethingi heard you last night said dudley breathlessly talking in your sleep moaningwhat dyou mean harry said again but there was a cold plunging sensation in his stomach he had revisited the graveyard last night in his dreamsdudley gave a harsh bark of laughter then adopted a highpitched whimpering voicedont kill cedric dont kill cedric whos cedric your

harry quietly shut up dudley im warning youcome and help me dad mum come and help me hes killed cedric dad help me hes going to dont you point that thing at medudley backed into the alley wall harry was pointing the wand directly at dudleys heart harry could feel fourteen years hatred of dudley pounding in his veins what wouldnt he give to strike now to jinx dudley so thoroughly hed have to crawl home like an insect struck dumb sprouting feelers dont ever talk about that again harry snarled dyou understand mepoint that thing somewhere elsei said do you understand mepoint it somewhere elsedo you understand meget that thing away from dudley gave an odd shuddering gasp as though he had been doused in icy watersomething had happened to the night the starstrewn indigo sky was suddenly pitch black and lightless the stars the moon the misty streetlamps at either end of the alley had vanished the distant rumble of cars and the whisper of trees had gone the balmy evening was suddenly piercingly bitingly cold they were surrounded by total impenetrable silent darkness as though some giant hand had dropped a thick icy mantle over the entire alleyway blinding themfor a split second harry thought he had done magic without meaning to despite the fact that hed been resisting as hard as he could then his reason caught up with his senses he didnt have the power to turn off the stars he turned his head this way and that trying to see something but the darkness pressed on his eyes like a weightless veildudleys terrified voice broke in harrys earwwhat are you ddoing ststop itim not doing anything shut up and dont movei ccant see ive ggone blind i i said shut upharry stood stock still turning his sightless eyes left and right the cold was so intense he was shivering all over goose bumps had erupted up his arms and the hairs on the back of his neck were standing up he opened his eyes to their fullest extent staring blankly around unseeingit was impossible they couldnt be here not in little whinging he strained his ears he would hear them before he saw them ill ttell dad dudley whimpered wwhere are you what are you ddowill you shut up harry hissed im trying to lis but he fell silent he had heard just the thing he had been dreadingthere was something in the alleyway apart from themselves something that was drawing long hoarse rattling breaths harry felt a horrible jolt of dread as he stood trembling in the freezing airccut it out stop doing it ill hhit you i swear i willdudley shut whama fist made contact with the side of harrys head lifting him off his feet small white lights popped in front of his eyes for the second time in an hour harry felt as though his head had been cleaved in two next moment he had landed hard on the ground and his wand had flown out of his handyou moron dudley harry yelled his eyes watering with pain as he scrambled to his hands and knees feeling around frantically n the blackness he heard dudley blundering away hitting the alley fence stumblingdudley come back youre running right at itthere was a horrible squealing yell and dudleys footsteps topped at the same moment harry felt a creeping chill behind him that could mean only one thing there was more than onedudley keep your mouth shut whatever you do keep your mouth shut wand harry muttered frantically his hands flying over the ground like spiders wheres wand come on lumoshe said the spell automatically desperate for light to help him n his search and to his disbelieving relief light flared inches from his right hand the wand tip had ignited harry snatched it up scrambled to his feet and turned aroundhis stomach turned overa towering hooded figure was gliding smoothly towards him hovering over the ground no feet or face visible beneath its robes sucking on the night as it camestumbling backwards harry raised his wandexpecto patronuma silvery wisp of vapour shot from the tip of the wand and the dementor slowed but the spell hadnt worked properly tripping over his own feet harry retreated further as the dementor bore down upon him panic fogging his brain concentrate a pair of grey slimy scabbed hands slid from inside the dementors robes reaching for him a rushing noise filled harrys earsexpecto patronumhis voice sounded dim and distant another wisp of silver smoke feebler than the last drifted from the wand he couldnt do it any more he couldnt work the spellthere was laughter inside his own head shrill highpitched laughter he could smell the dementors putrid deathcold breath filling his own lungs drowning him think something happy but there was no happiness in him the dementors icy fingers were closing on his throat the highpatched laughter was growing louder and louder and a voice spoke inside his head bow to death harry it might even be painless i would not know i have never diedhe was never going to see ron and hermione again and their faces burst clearly into his mind as he fought for breathexpecto patronuman enormous silver stag erupted from the tip of harrys wand its antlers caught the dementor in the place where the heart should have been it was thrown backwards weightless as darkness and as the stag charged the dementor swooped away batlike and defeatedthis way harry shouted at the stag wheeling around he sprinted down the alleyway holding the lit wand aloft dudley dudleyhe had run barely a dozen steps when he reached them dudley was curled up on the ground his arms clamped over his face a second dementor was crouching low over him gripping his wrists in its slimy hands prising them slowly almost lovingly apart lowering its hooded head towards dudleys face as though about to kiss himget it harry bellowed and with a rushing roaring sound the silver stag he had conjured came galloping past him the dementors eyeless face was barely an inch from dudleys when the silver antlers caught it the thing was thrown up into the air and like its fellow it soared away and was absorbed into the darkness the stag cantered to the end of the alleyway and dissolved into silver mistmoon stars and streetlamps burst back into life a warm breeze swept the alleyway trees rustled in neighbouring gardens and the mundane rumble of cars in magnolia crescent filled the air againharry stood quite still all his senses vibrating taking in the abrupt return to normality after a moment he became aware that his tshirt was sticking to him he was drenched in sweathe could not believe what had just happened dementors here in little whingingdudley lay curled up on the ground whimpering and shaking harry bent down to see whether he was in a fit state to stand up but then he heard loud running footsteps behind him instinctively raising his wand again he span on his heel to face the newcomermrs figg their batty old neighbour came panting into sight her grizzled grey hair was escaping from its hairnet a clanking string shopping bag was swinging from her wrist and her feet were halfway out of her tartan carpet slippers harry made to stow his wand hurriedly out of sight but dont put it away idiot boy she shrieked what if there are more of them around oh im going to kill mundungus fletcherchapter two a peck of owlswhat said harry blanklyhe left said mrs figg wringing her hands left to see someone about a batch of cauldrons that fell off the back of a broom i told him id flay him alive if he went and now look dementors its just lucky i put mr tibbles on the case but we havent got time to stand around hurry now weve got to get you back oh the trouble this is going to cause i will kill himbut the revelation that his batty old catobsessed neighbour knew what dementors were was almost as big a shock to harry as meeting two of them down the alleyway youre youre a witchim a squib as mundungus knows full well so how on earth was i supposed to help you fight off dementors he left you completely without cover when id warned him this mundungus has been following me hang on it was him he disapparated from the front of my houseyes yes yes but luckily id stationed mr tibbles under a car just in case and mr tibbles came and warned me but by the time i got to your house youd gone and now oh whats dumbledore going to say you she shrieked at dudley still supine on the alley floor get your fat bottom off the ground quickyou know dumbledore said harry staring at herof course i know dumbledore who doesnt know dumbledore but come on ill be no help if they come back ive never so much as transfigured a teabagshe stooped down seized one of dudleys massive arms in her wizened hands and tuggedget up you useless lump get upbut dudley either could not or would not move he remained on the ground trembling and ashenfaced his mouth shut very tightill do it harry took hold of dudleys arm and heaved with an enormous effort he managed to hoist him to his feet dudley seemed to be on the point of fainting his small eyes were rolling in their sockets and sweat was beading his face the moment harry let go of him he swayed dangerouslyhurry up said mrs figg hystericallyharry pulled one of dudleys massive arms around his own shoulders and dragged him towards the road sagging slightly under the weight mrs figg tottered along in front of them peering anxiously around the cornerkeep your wand out she told harry as they entered wisteria walk never mind the statute of secrecy now theres going to be hell to pay anyway we might as well be hanged for a dragon as an egg talk about the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery this was exactly what dumbledore was afraid of whats that at the end of the street oh its just mr prentice dont put your wand away boy dont i keep telling you im no useit was not easy to hold a wand steady and haul dudley along at the same time harry gave his cousin an impatient dig in the ribs but dudley seemed to have lost all desire for independent movement he was slumped on harrys shoulder his large feet dragging along the groundwhy didnt you tell me youre a squib mrs figg asked harry panting with the effort to keep walking all those times i came round your house why didnt you say anythingdumbledores orders i was to keep an eye on you but not say anything you were too young im sorry i gave you such a miserable time harry but the dursleys would never have let you come if theyd thought you enjoyed it it wasnt easy you know but oh my word she said tragically wringing her hands once more when dumbledore hears about this how could mundungus have left he was supposed to be on duty until midnight where is he how am i going to tell dumbledore whats happened i cant apparateive got an owl you can borrow her harry groaned wondering whether his spine was going to snap under dudleys weightharry you dont understand dumbledore will need to act as quickly as possible the ministry have their own ways of detecting underage magic theyll know already you mark my wordsbut i was getting rid of dementors i had to use magic theyre going to be more worried about what dementors were doing floating around wisteria walk surelyoh my dear i wish it were so but im afraid mundungus fletcher i am going to kill youthere was a loud crack and a strong smell of drink mingled with stale tobacco filled the air as a squat unshaven man in a tattered overcoat materialised right in front of them he had short bandy legs long straggly ginger hair and bloodshot baggy eyes that gave him the doleful look of a basset hound he was also clutching a silvery bundle that harry recognised at once as an invisibility cloaksup figgy he said staring from mrs figg to harry and dudley what appened to staying undercoverill give you undercover cried mrs figg dementors you useless skiving sneak thiefdementors repeated mundungus aghast dementors ereyes here you worthless pile of bat droppings here shrieked mrs figg dementors attacking the boy on your watchblimey said mundungus weakly looking from mrs figg to harry and back again blimey i and you off buying stolen cauldrons didnt i tell you not to go didnt ii well i mundungus looked deeply uncomfortable it it was a very good business opportunity see mrs figg raised the arm from which her string bag dangled and whacked mundungus around the lace and neck with it judging by the clanking noise it made it was full of cat foodouch gerroff gerroff you mad old bat someones gotta tell dumbledoreyes they have yelled mrs figg swinging the bag of cat food at every bit of mundungus she could reach and it had better be you and you can tell him why you werent there to helpkeep your airnet on said mundungus his arms over his head cowering im going im goingand with another loud crack he vanishedi hope dumbledore murders him said mrs figg furiously now come on harry what are you waiting forharry decided not to waste his remaining breath on pointing out that he could barely walk under dudleys bulk he gave the semiconscious dudley a heave and staggered onwardsill take you to the door said mrs figg as they turned into privet drive just in case there are more of them around oh my word what a catastrophe and you had to fight them off yourself and dumbledore said we were to keep you from doing magic at all costs well its no good crying over spilt potion i suppose but the cats among the pixies nowso harry panted dumbledores been having me followedof course he has said mrs figg impatiently

i expect someone will be in touch with you soon enoughwhat are you going to do asked harry quicklyim going straight home said mrs figg staring around the dark street and shuddering ill need to wait for more instructions just stay in the house goodnighthang on dont go yet i want to know but mrs figg had already set off at a trot carpet slippers flopping string bag clankingwait harry shouted after her he had a million questions to ask anyone who was in contact with dumbledore but within seconds mrs figg was swallowed by the darkness scowling harry readjusted dudley on his shoulder and made his slow painful way up number fours garden paththe hall light was on harry stuck his wand back inside the waistband of his jeans rang the bell and watched aunt petunias outline grow larger and larger oddly distorted by the rippling glass in the front doordiddy about time too i was getting quite quite diddy whats the matterharry looked sideways at dudley and ducked out from under his arm just in time dudley swayed on the spot for a moment his face pale green then he opened his mouth and vomited all over the doormatdiddy diddy whats the matter with you vernon vernonharrys uncle came galumphing out of the living room walrus moustache blowing hither and thither as it always did when he was agitated he hurried forwards to help aunt petunia negotiate a weakkneed dudley over the threshold while avoiding stepping in the pool of sickhes ill vernonwhat is it son whats happened did mrs polkiss give you something foreign for teawhy are you all covered in dirt darling have you been lying on the groundhang on you havent been mugged have you sonaunt petunia screamedphone the police vernon phone the police diddy darling speak to mummy what did they do to youin all the kerfuffle nobody seemed to have noticed harry which suited him perfectly he managed to slip inside just before uncle vernon slammed the door and while the dursleys made their noisy progress down the hall towards the kitchen harry moved carefully and quietly towards the stairswho did it son give us names well get them dont worryshh hes trying to say something vernon what is it diddy tell mummyharrys foot was on the bottommost stair when dudley found his voicehimharry froze foot on the stair face screwed up braced for the explosionboy come herewith a feeling of mingled dread and anger harry removed his foot slowly from the stair and turned to follow the dursleysthe scrupulously clean kitchen had an oddly unreal glitter after the darkness outside aunt petunia was ushering dudley into a chair he was still very green and clammylooking uncle vernon was standing in front of the draining board glaring at harry through tiny narrowed eyeswhat have you done to my son he said in a menacing growlnothing said harry knowing perfectly well that uncle vernon wouldnt believe himwhat did he do to you diddy aunt petunia said in a quavering voice now sponging sick from the front of dudleys leather jacket was it was it youknowwhat darling did he use his thingslowly tremulously dudley noddedi didnt harry said sharply as aunt petunia let out a wail and uncle vernon raised his fists i didnt do anything to him it wasnt me it was but at that precise moment a screech owl swooped in through the kitchen window narrowly missing the top of uncle vernons head it soared across the kitchen dropped the large parchment envelope it was carrying in its beak at harrys feet turned gracefully the tips of its wings just brushing the top of the fridge then zoomed outside again and off across the gardenowls bellowed uncle vernon the wellworn vein in his temple pulsing angrily as he slammed the kitchen window shut owls again i will not have any more owls in my housebut harry was already ripping open the envelope and pulling out the letter inside his heart pounding somewhere in the region of his adams appledear mr potterwe have received intelligence that you performed the patronus charm at twentythree minutes past nine this evening in a muggleinhabited area and in the presence of a mugglethe severity of this breach of the decree for the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery has resulted in your expulsion

previous offence under section of the international confederation of warlocks statute of secrecy we regret to inform you that your presence is required at a disciplinary hearing at the ministry of magic at am on the twelfth of augusthoping you are wellyours sincerelymafalda hopkirkimproper use of magic officeministry of magicharry read the letter through twice he was only vaguely aware of uncle vernon and aunt petunia talking inside his head all was icy and numb one fact had penetrated his consciousness like a paralysing dart he was expelled from hogwarts it was all over he was never going backhe looked up at the dursleys uncle vernon was purplefaced shouting his fists still raised aunt petunia had her arms around dudley who was retching againharrys temporarily stupefied brain seemed to reawaken ministry representatives will be calling at your place of residence shortly to destroy your wand there was only one thing for it he would have to run now where he was going to go harry didnt know but he was certain of one thing at hogwarts or outside it he needed his wand in an almost dreamlike state he pulled his wand out and turned to leave the kitchenwhere dyou think youre going yelled uncle venon when harry didnt reply he pounded across the kitchen to block the doorway into the hall i havent finished with you boyget out of the way said harry quietlyyoure going to stay here and explain how my son if you dont get out of the way im going to jinx you said harry raising the wandyou cant pull that one on me snarled uncle vernon i knowyoure not allowed to use it outside that madhouse you call a schoolthe madhouse has chucked me out said harry so i can do whatever i like youve got three seconds one two a resounding crack filled the kitchen aunt petunia screamed uncle vernon yelled and ducked but for the third time that night harry was searching for the source of a disturbance he had not made he spotted it at once a dazed and ruffledlooking barn owl was sitting outside on the kitchen sill having just collided with the closed windowignoring uncle vernons anguished yell of owls harry crossed the room at a run and wrenched the window open the owl stuck out its leg to which a small roll of parchment was tied shook its feathers and took off the moment harry had taken the letter hands shaking harry unfurled the second message which was written very hastily and blotchily in black inkharry dumbledores just arrived at the ministry and hes trying to sort it all out do not leave your aunt and uncles house do not do any more magic do not surrender your wandarthur weasleydumbledore was trying to sort it all out what did that mean how much power did dumbledore have to override the ministry of magic was there a chance that he might be allowed back to hogwarts then a small shoot of hope burgeoned in harrys chest almost immediately strangled by panic how was he supposed to refuse to surrender his wand without doing magic hed have to duel with the ministry representatives and if he did that hed be lucky to escape azkaban let alone expulsionhis mind was racing he could run for it and risk being captured by the ministry or stay put and wait for them to find him here he was much more tempted by the former course but he mew mr weasley had his best interests at heart and after all dumbledore had sorted out much worse than this beforeright harry said ive changed my mind im stayinghe flung himself down at the kitchen table and faced dudley and aunt petunia the dursleys appeared taken aback at his abrupt change of mind aunt petunia glanced despairingly at uncle vernon the vein in his purple temple was throbbing worse than everwho are all these ruddy owls from he growledthe first one was from the ministry of magic expelling me said harry calmly he was straining his ears to catch any noises outside in case the ministry representatives were approaching and it was easier and quieter to answer uncle vernons questions than to have him start raging and bellowing the second one was from my friend rons dad who works at the ministryministry of magic bellowed uncle vernon people like you in government oh this explains everything everything no wonder the countrys going to the dogswhen harry did not respond uncle vernon glared at him then spat out and why have you been expelledbecause i did magicaha roared uncle vernon slamming his fist down on top of the fridge which sprang open several of dudleys lowfat snacks toppled out and burst on the floor so you admit it what did you do to dudleynothing said harry slightly less calmly that wasnt me was muttered dudley unexpectedly and uncle vernon and aunt petunia instantly made flapping gestures at harry to quieten him while they both bent low over dudleygo on son said uncle vernon what did he dotell us darling whispered aunt petuniapointed his wand at me dudley mumbledyeah i did but i didnt use harry began angrily but shut up roared uncle vernon and aunt petunia in unisongo on son repeated uncle vernon moustache blowing about furiouslyall went dark dudley said hoarsely shuddering everything dark and then i hheard things inside mmy headuncle vernon and aunt petunia exchanged looks of utter horror if their least favourite thing in the world was magic closely followed by neighbours who cheated more than they did on the hosepipe ban people who heard voices were definitely in the bottom ten they obviously thought dudley was losing his mindwhat sort of things did you hear popkin breathed aunt petunia very whitefaced and with tears in her eyesbut dudley seemed incapable of saying he shuddered again and shook his large blond head and despite the sense of numb dread that had settled on harry since the arrival of the first owl he felt a certain curiosity dementors caused a person to relive the worst moments of their life what would spoiled pampered bullying dudley have been forced to hearhow come you fell over son said uncle vernon in an unnaturally quiet voice the kind of voice he might adopt at the bedside of a very ill personttripped said dudley shakily and then he gestured at his massive chest harry understood dudley was remembering the clammy cold that filled the lungs as hope and happiness were sucked out of youhorrible croaked dudley cold really coldok said uncle vernon in a voice of forced calm while aunt petunia laid an anxious hand on dudleys forehead to feel his temperature what happened then duddersfelt felt felt as if as if as if youd never be happy again harry supplied dullyyes dudley whispered still tremblingso said uncle vernon voice restored to full and considerable volume as he straightened up you put some crackpot spell on my on so hed hear voices and believe he was was doomed to misery or something did youhow many times do i have to tell you said harry temper and voice both rising it wasnt me it was a couple of dementorsa couple of whats this codswallopde men tors said harry slowly and clearly two of themand what the ruddy hell are dementorsthey guard the wizard prison azkaban said aunt petuniatwo seconds of ringing silence followed these words before aunt petunia clapped her hand over her mouth as though she had let slip a disgusting swear word uncle vernon was goggling at her harrys brain reeled mrs figg was one thing but aunt petuniahow dyou know that he asked her astonishedaunt petunia looked quite appalled with herself she glanced at uncle vernon in fearful apology then lowered her hand slightly to reveal her horsy teethi heard that awful boy telling her about them years ago she said jerkilyif you mean my mum and dad why dont you use their names said harry loudly but aunt petunia ignored him she seemed horribly flusteredharry was stunned except for one outburst years ago in the course of which aunt petunia had screamed that harrys mother had been a freak he had never heard her mention her sister he was astounded that she had remembered this scrap of information about the magical world for so long when she usually put all her energies into pretending it didnt existuncle vernon opened his mouth closed it again opened it once more shut it then apparently struggling to remember how to talk opened it for a third time and croaked so so they er they er they actually exist do they er dementywhatsitsaunt petunia noddeduncle vernon looked from aunt petunia to dudley to harry as if hoping somebody was going to shout april fool when nobody did he opened his mouth yet again but was spared the struggle to find more words by the arrival of the third owl of the evening it zoomed through the stillopen window like a feathery cannonball and landed with a clatter on the kitchen table causing all three of the dursleys to jump with fright harry tore a second officiallooking envelope from the owls beak and ripped it open as the owl swooped back out into the nightenough effing owls muttered uncle vernon distractedly stomping over to the window and slamming it shut againdear mr potterfurther to our letter of approximately twentytwo minutes ago the ministry of magic has revised its decision to destroy your wand forthwith you may retain your wand until your disciplinary hearing on the twelfth of august at which time an official decision will be takenfollowing discussions with the headmaster of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry the ministry has agreed that the question of your expulsion will also be decided at that time you should therefore consider yourself suspended from school pending further enquirieswith best wishesyours sincerelymafalda hopkirkimproper use of magic officeministry of magicharry read this letter through three times in quick succession the miserable knot in his chest loosened slightly with the relief of knowing he was not yet definitely expelled though his fears were by no means banished everything seemed to hang on this hearing on the twelfth of augustwell said uncle vernon recalling harry to his surroundings what now have they sentenced you to anything do your lot have the death penalty he added as a hopeful afterthoughtive got to go to a hearing said harryand theyll sentence you therei suppose soi wont give up hope then said uncle vernon nastilywell if thats all said harry getting to his feet he was desperate to be alone to think perhaps to send a letter to ron hermione or siriusno it ruddy well is not all bellowed uncle vernon sit back downwhat now said harry impatientlydudley roared uncle vernon i want to know exactly what happened to my sonfine yelled harry and in his temper red and gold sparks shot out of the end of his wand still clutched in his hand all three dursleys flinched looking terrifieddudley and i were in the alleyway between magnolia crescent and wisteria walk said harry speaking fast fighting to control his temper dudley thought hed be smart with me i pulled out my wand but didnt use it then two dementors turned up but what are dementoids asked uncle vernon furiously what do they doi told you they suck all the happiness out of you said harry and if they get the chance they kiss you kiss you said uncle vernon his eyes popping slightly kiss youits what they call it when they suck the soul out of your mouthaunt petunia uttered a soft screamhis soul they didnt take hes still got his she seized dudley by the shoulders and shook him as though testing to see whether she could hear his soul rattling around inside hintof course they didnt get his soul youd know if they had said harry exasperatedfought em off did you son said uncle vernon loudly with the appearance of a man struggling to bring the conversation back on to a plane he understood gave em the old onetwo did youyou cant give a dementor the old onetwo said harry through clenched teethwhys he all right then blustered uncle vernon why isnt e all empty thenbecause i used the patronus whoosh with a clattering a whirring of wings and a soft fall of dust a fourth owl came shooting out of the kitchen fireplacefor gods sake roared uncle vernon pulling great clumps of hair out of his moustache something he hadnt been driven to do in a long time i will not have owls here i will not tolerate this i tell youbut harry was already pulling a roll of parchment from the owls leg he was so convinced that this letter had to be from dumbledore explaining everything the dementors mrs figg what the ministry was up to how he dumbledore intended to sort everything out that for the first time in his life he was disappointed to see siriuss handwriting ignoring uncle vernons ongoing rant about owls and narrowing his eyes against a second cloud of dust as the most recent owl took off back up the chimney harry read siriuss messagearthur has just told us whats happened dont leave the house again whatever you doharry found this such an inadequate response to everything that had happened tonight that he turned the piece of parchment over looking for the rest of the letter but there was nothing elseand now his temper was rising again wasnt anybody going to say well done for fighting off two dementors singlehanded both mr weasley and sirius were acting as though hed misbehaved and were saving their tellingsoff until they could ascertain how much damage had been donea peck i mean pack of owls shooting in and out of my house i wont have it boy i wont i cant stop the owls coming harry snapped crushing siriuss letter in his fisti want the truth about what happened tonight barked uncle vernon if it was demenders who hurt dudley how come youve been expelled you did youknowwhat youve admitted itharry took a deep steadying breath his head was beginning to ache again he wanted more than anything to get out of the kitchen and away from the dursleysi did the patronus charm to get rid of the dementors he said forcing himself to remain calm its the only thing that works against thembut what were dementoids doing in little whinging said uncle vernon in an outraged tonecouldnt tell you said harry wearily no ideahis head was pounding in the glare of the striplighting now his anger was ebbing away he felt drained exhausted the dursleys were all staring at himits you said uncle vernon forcefully its got something to do with you boy i know it why else would they turn up here why else would they be down that alleyway youve got to be the only the only evidently he couldnt bring himself to say the word wizard the only youknowwhat for milesi dont know why they were herebut at uncle vernons words harrys exhausted brain had ground back into action why had the dementors come to little whinging how could it be coincidence that they had arrived in the alleyway where harry was had they been sent had the ministry of magic lost control of the dementors had they deserted azkaban and joined voldemort as dumbledore had predicted they wouldthese demembers guard some weirdo prison asked uncle vernon lumbering along in the wake of harrys train of thoughtyes said harryif only his head would stop hurting if only he could just leave the kitchen and get to his dark bedroom and think oho they were coming to arrest you said uncle vernon with the triumphant air of a man reaching an unassailable conclusion thats it isnt it boy youre on the run from the lawof course im not said harry shaking his head as though to scare off a fly his mind racing nowthen why he must have sent them said harry quietly more to himself than to uncle vernonwhats that who must have sent themlord voldemort said harryhe registered dimly how strange it was that the dursleys who flinched winced and squawked if they heard words like wizard magic or wand could hear the name of the most evil wizard of all time without the slightest tremorlord hang on said uncle vernon his face screwed up a look of dawning comprehension coming into his piggy eyes ive heard that name that was the one who murdered my parents yes harry said dullybut hes gone said uncle vernon impatiently without the slightest sign that the murder of harrys parents might be a painful topic that giant bloke said so hes gonehes back said harry heavilyit felt very strange to be standing here in aunt petunias surgically clean kitchen beside the topoftherange fridge and the widescreen television talking calmly of lord voldemort to uncle vernon the arrival of the dementors in little whinging seemed to have breached the great invisible wall that divided the relentlessly nonmagical world of privet drive and the world beyond harrys two lives had somehow become fused and everything had been turned upsidedown the dursleys were asking for details about the magical world and mrs figg knew albus dumbledore dementors were soaring around little whinging and he might never return to hogwarts harrys head throbbed more painfullyback whispered aunt petuniashe was looking at harry as she had never looked at him before and all of a sudden for the very first time in his life harry fully appreciated that aunt petunia was his mothers sister he could not have said why this hit him so very powerfully at this moment all he knew was that he was not the only person in the room who had an inkling of what lord voldemort being back might mean aunt petunia had never in her life looked at him like that before her large pale eyes so unlike her sisters were not narrowed in dislike or anger they were wide and fearful the furious pretence that aunt petunia had maintained all harrys life that there was no magic and no world other than the world she inhabited with uncle vernon seemed to have fallen awayyes harry said talking directly to aunt petunia now he came back a month ago i saw himher hands found dudleys massive leatherclad shoulders and clutched themhang on said uncle vernon looking from his wife to harry and back again apparently dazed and confused by the unprecedented understanding that seemed to have sprung up between them hang on this lord voldythings back you sayyesthe one who murdered your parentsyesand now hes sending dismembers after youlooks like it said harryt see said uncle vernon looking from his whitefaced wife to harry and hitching up his trousers he seemed to be swelling hisgreat purple face stretching before harrys eyes well that settles it he said his shirt front straining as he inflated himself you can get out of this house boywhat said

all crushed in his left hand dont leave the house again whatever you do do not leave your aunt and uncles houseyou heard me said uncle vernon bending forwards now his massive purple face coming so close to harrys he actually felt flecks of spit hit his face get going you were all keen to leave half an hour ago im right behind you get out and never darken our doorstep again why we ever kept you in the first place i dont know marge was right it should have been the orphanage we were too damn soft for our own good thought we could squash it out of you thought we could turn you normal but youve been rotten from the beginning and ive had enough owlsthe fifth owl zoomed down the chimney so fast it actually hit the floor before zooming into the air again with a loud screech harry raised his hand to seize the letter which was in a scarlet envelope but it soared straight over his head flying directly at aunt petunia who let out a scream and ducked her arms over her face the owl dropped the red envelope on her head turned and flew straight back up the chimneyharry darted forwards to pick up the letter but aunt petunia beat him to ityou can open it if you like said harry but ill hear what it says anyway thats a howlerlet go of it petunia roared uncle vernon dont touch it it could be dangerousits addressed to me said aunt petunia in a shaking voice its addressed to me vernon look mrs petunia dursley the kitchen number four privet drive she caught her breath horrified the red envelope had begun to smokeopen it harry urged her get it over with itll happen anywaynoaunt petunias hand was trembling she looked wildly around the kitchen as though looking for an escape route but too late the envelope burst into flames aunt petunia screamed and dropped itan awful voice filled the kitchen echoing in the confined space issuing from the burning letter on the tableremember my last petuniaaunt petunia looked as though she might faint she sank into the chair beside dudley her face in her hands the remains of the envelope smouldered into ash in the silencewhat is this uncle vernon said hoarsely what i dont petuniaaunt petunia said nothing dudley was staring stupidly at his mother his mouth hanging open the silence spiralled horribly harry was watching his aunt utterly bewildered his head throbbing fit to burstpetunia dear said uncle vernon timidly ppetuniashe raised her head she was still trembling she swallowedthe boy the boy will have to stay vernon she said weaklywwhathe stays she said she was not looking at harry she got to her feet againhe but petunia if we throw him out the neighbours will talk she said she was rapidly regaining her usual brisk snappish manner though she was still very pale theyll ask awkward questions theyll want to know where hes gone well have to keep himuncle vernon was deflating like an old tyrebut petunia dear aunt petunia ignored him she turned to harryyoure to stay in your room she said youre not to leave the house now get to bedharry didnt movewho was that howler fromdont ask questions aunt petunia snappedare you in touch with wizardsi told you to get to bedwhat did it mean remember the last whatgo to bedhow come you heard your aunt now go up to bedchapter three the advance guardive just been attacked by dementors and i might be expelled from hogwarts i want to know whats going on and when im going to get out of hereharry copied these words on to three separate pieces of parchment the moment he reached the desk in his dark bedroom he addressed the first to sirius the second to ron and the third to hermione his owl hedwig was off hunting her cage stood empty on the desk harry paced the bedroom waiting for her to come back his head pounding his brain too busy for sleep even though his eyes stung and itched with tiredness his back ached from hauling dudley home and the two lumps on his head where the window and dudley had hit him were throbbing painfullyup and down he paced consumed with anger and frustration grinding his teeth and clenching his fists casting angry looks out at the empty starstrewn sky every time he passed the window dementors sent to get him mrs figg and mundungus fletcher tailing him in secret then suspension from hogwarts and a hearing at the ministry of magic and still no one was telling him what was going onand what what had that howler been about whose voice had echoed so horribly so menacingly through the kitchenwhy was he still trapped here without information why was everyone treating him like some naughty kid dont do any more magic stay in the house he kicked his school trunk as he passed it but far from relieving his anger he felt worse as he now had a sharp pain in his toe to deal with in addition to the pain in the rest of his bodyjust as he limped past the window hedwig soared through it with a soft rustle of wings like a small ghostabout time harry snarled as she landed lightly on top of her cage you can put that down ive got work for youhedwigs large round amber eyes gazed at him reproachfully over the dead frog clamped in her beakcome here said harry picking up the three small rolls of parchment and a leather thong and tying the scrolls to her scaly leg take these straight to sirius ron and hermione and dont come back here without good long replies keep pecking them till theyve written decentlength answers if youve got to understandhedwig gave a muffled hooting noise her beak still full of frogget going then said harryshe took off immediately the moment shed gone harry threw himself down on his bed without undressing and stared at the dark ceiling in addition to every other miserable feeling he now felt guilty that hed been irritable with hedwig she was the only friend he had at number four privet drive but hed make it up to her when she came back with the answers from sirius ron and hermionethey were bound to write back quickly they couldnt possibly ignore a dementor attack hed probably wake up tomorrow to three fat letters full of sympathy and plans for his immediate removal to the burrow and with that comforting idea sleep rolled over him stifling all further thoughtbut hedwig didnt return next morning harry spent the day in his bedroom leaving it only to go to the bathroom three times that day aunt petunia shoved food into his room through the catflap uncle vernon had installed three summers ago every time harry heard her approaching he tried to question her about the howler but he might as well have interrogated the doorknob for all the answers he got otherwise the dursleys kept well clear of his bedroom harry couldnt see the point of forcing his company on them another row would achieve nothing except perhaps make him so angry hed perform more illegal magicso it went on for three whole days harry was alternately filled with restless energy that made him unable to settle to anything during which time he paced his bedroom furious at the whole lot of them for leaving him to stew in this mess and with a lethargy so complete that he could lie on his bed for an hour at a time staring dazedly into space aching with dread at the thought of the ministry hearingwhat if they ruled against him what if he was expelled and his wand was snapped in half what would he do where would he go he could not return to living fulltime with the dursleys not now he knew the other world the one to which he really belonged might he be able to move into siriuss house as sirius had suggested a year ago before he had been forced to flee from the ministry would harry be allowed to live there alone given that he was still underage or would the matter of where he went next be decided for him had his breach of the international statute of secrecy been severe enough to land him in a cell in azkaban whenever this thought occurred harry invariably slid off his bed and began pacing againon the fourth night after hedwigs departure harry was lying in one of his apathetic phases staring at the ceiling his exhausted mind quite blank when his uncle entered his bedroom harry looked slowly around at him uncle vernon was wearing his best suit and an expression of enormous smugnesswere going out he saidsorrywe that is to say your aunt dudley and i are going outfine said harry dully looking back at the ceilingyou are not to leave your bedroom while we are awayokyou are not to touch the television the stereo or any of our possessionsrightyou are not to steal food from the fridgeoki am going to lock your dooryou do thatuncle vernon glared at harry clearly suspicious of this lack of argument then stomped out of the room and closed the door behind him harry heard the key turn in the lock and uncle vernons footsteps walking heavily down the stairs a few minutes later he heard the slamming of car doors the rumble of an engine and the unmistakeable sound of the car sweeping out of the driveharry had no particular feeling about the dursleys leaving it made no difference to him whether they were in the house or not he could not even summon the energy to get up and turn on his bedroom light the room grew steadily darker around him as he lay listening to the night sounds through the window he kept open all the time waiting for the blessed moment when hedwig returnedthe empty house creaked around him the pipes gurgled harry ay there in a kind of stupor thinking of nothing suspended in miserythen quite distinctly he heard a crash in the kitchen belowhe sat bolt upright listening intently the dursleys couldnt be back it was much too soon and in any case he hadnt heard their carthere was silence for a few seconds then voicesburglars he thought sliding off the bed on to his feet but a split second later it occurred to him that burglars would keep their voices down and whoever was moving around in the kitchen was certainly not troubling to do sohe snatched up his wand from the bedside table and stood lacing his bedroom door listening with all his might next moment he jumped as the lock gave a loud click and his door swung openharry stood motionless staring through the open doorway at the dark upstairs landing straining his ears for further sounds but none came he hesitated for a moment then moved swiftly and silently out of his room to the head of the stairshis heart shot upwards into his throat there were people standing in the shadowy hall below silhouetted against the streetlight glowing through the glass door eight or nine of them all as far as he could see looking up at himlower your wand boy before you take someones eye out said a low growling voiceharrys heart was thumping uncontrollably he knew that voice but he did not lower his wandprofessor moody he said uncertainlyi dont know so much about professor growled the voice never got round to much teaching did i get down here we want to see you properlyharry lowered his wand slightly but did not relax his grip on it nor did he move he had very good reason to be suspicious he had recently spent nine months in what he had thought was madeye moodys company only to find out that it wasnt moody at all but an impostor an impostor moreover who had tried to kill harry before being unmasked but before he could make a decision about what to do next a second slightly hoarse voice floated upstairsits all right harry weve come to take you awayharrys heart leapt he knew that voice too though he hadnt heard it for over a yearpprofessor lupin he said disbelievingly is that youwhy are we all standing in the dark said a third voice this one completely unfamiliar a womans lumosa wandtip flared illuminating the hall with magical light harry blinked the people below were crowded around the loot of the stairs gazing up at him intently some craning their heads for a better lookremus lupin stood nearest to him though still quite young lupin looked tired and rather ill he had more grey hairs than when harry had last said goodbye to him and his robes were more patched and shabbier than ever nevertheless he was smiling broadly at harry who tried to smile back despite his state of shockoooh he looks just like i thought he would said the witch who was holding her lit wand aloft she looked the youngest there she had a pale heartshaped face dark twinkling eyes and short spiky hair that was a violent shade of violet wotcher harryyeah i see what you mean remus said a bald black wizard standing furthest back he had a deep slow voice and wore a single gold hoop in his ear he looks exactly like jamesexcept the eyes said a wheezyvoiced silverhaired wizard at the back lilys eyesmadeye moody who had long grizzled grey hair and a large chunk missing from his nose was squinting suspiciously at harry through his mismatched eyes one eye was small dark and beady the other large round and electric blue the magical eye that could see through walls doors and the back of moodys own headare you quite sure its him lupin he growled iid be a nice lookout if we bring back some death eater impersonating him we ought to ask him something only the real potter would know unless anyone brought any veritaserumharry what form does your patronus take lupin askeda stag said harry nervouslythats him madeye said lupinvery conscious of everybody still staring at him harry descended the stairs stowing his wand in the back pocket of his jeans as he camedont put your wand there boy roared moody what if it ignited better wizards than you have lost buttocks you knowwho dyou know whos lost a buttock the violethaired woman asked madeye interestedlynever you mind you just keep your wand out of your back pocket growled madeye elementary wandsafety nobody bothers about it any more he stumped off towards the kitchen and i saw that he added irritably as the woman rolled her eyes towards the ceilinglupin held out his hand and shook harryshow are you he asked looking closely at harryffine harry could hardly believe this was real four weeks with nothing not the tiniest hint of a plan to remove him from privet drive and suddenly a whole bunch of wizards was standing matteroffactly in the house as though this was a longstanding arrangement he glanced at the people surrounding lupin they were still gazing avidly at him he felt very conscious of the fact that he had riot combed his hair for four daysim youre really lucky the dursleys are out he mumbledlucky ha said the violethaired woman it was me who lured them out of the way sent a letter by muggle post telling themtheyd been shortlisted for the allengland best kept suburban lawn competition theyre heading off to the prizegiving right now or they think they areharry had a fleeting vision of uncle vernons face when he realised there was no allengland best kept suburban lawn competitionwe are leaving arent we he asked soonalmost at once said lupin were just waiting for the allclearwhere are we going the burrow harry asked hopefullynot the burrow no said lupin motioning harry towards the kitchen the little knot of wizards followed all still eyeing harry curiously too risky weve set up headquarters somewhere undetectable its taken a while madeye moody was now sitting at the kitchen table swigging from a hip flask his magical eye spinning in all directions taking in the dursleys many laboursaving appliancesthis is alastor moody harry lupin continued pointing towards moody yeah i know said harry uncomfortably it felt odd to be introduced to somebody hed thought hed known for a yearand this is nymphadora dont call me nymphadora remus said the young witch with a shudder its tonksnymphadora tonks who prefers to be known by her surname only finished lupinso would you if your fool of a mother had called you nymphadora muttered tonksand this is kingsley shacklebolt he indicated the tall black wizard who bowed elphias doge the wheezyvoiced wizard nodded dedalus diggle weve met before squeaked the excitable diggle dropping his violetcoloured top hatemmeline vance a statelylooking witch in an emerald green shawl inclined her head sturgis podmore a squarejawed wizard with thick strawcoloured hair winked and hestia jones a pinkcheeked blackhaired witch waved from next to the toasterharry inclined his head awkwardly at each of them as they were introduced he wished they would look at something other than him it was as though he had suddenly been ushered onstage he also wondered why so many of their were therea surprising number of people volunteered to come and get you said lupin as though he had read harrys mind the corners of his mouth twitched slightlyyeah well the more the better said moody darkly were your guard potterwere just waiting for the signal to tell us its safe to set off said lupin glancing out of the kitchen window weve got about fifteen minutesvery clean arent they these muggles said the witch called tonks who was looking around the kitchen with great interest my dads muggleborn and hes a right old slob i suppose it varies just as it does with wizardser yeah said harry look he turned back to lupin whats going on i havent heard anything from anyone whats volseveral of the witches and wizards made odd hissing noises dedalus diggle dropped his hat again and moody growled shut upwhat said harrywere not discussing anything here its too risky said moody turning his normal eye on harry his magical eye remained focused on the ceiling damn it he added angrily putting a hand up to the magical eye it keeps getting stuck ever since that scum wore itand with a nasty squelching sound much like a plunger being pulled from a sink he popped out his eyemadeye you do know thats disgusting dont you said tonks conversationallyget me a glass of water would you harry requested moodyharry crossed to the dishwasher took out a clean glass and filled it with water at the sink still watched eagerly by the band of wizards their relentless staring was starting to annoy himcheers said moody when harry handed him the glass he dropped the magical eyeball into the water and prodded it up and down the eye whizzed around staring at them all in turn i want three hundred and sixty degrees visibility on the return journeyhowre we getting wherever were going harry askedbrooms said lupin only way youre too young to apparate theyll be watching the floo network and its more than our lifes worth to set up an unauthorised portkeyremus says youre a good flier said kingsley shacklebolt in his deep voicehes excellent said lupin who was checking his watch anyway youd better go and get packed harry we want to be ready to go when the signal comesill come and help you said tonks brightlyshe followed harry back into the hall and up the stairs looking around with much curiosity and interestfunny place she said its a bit too clean dyou know what i mean bit unnatural oh this is better she added as they entered harrys bedroom and he turned on the lighthis room was certainly much messier than the rest of the house confined to it for four days in a very bad mood harry had not bothered tidying up after himself most of the books he owned were strewn over the floor where hed tried to distract himself with each in turn and thrown it aside hedwigs cage needed cleaning out and was starting to smell and his trunk lay open revealing a jumbled mixture of muggle clothes and wizards robes that had spilled on to the floor around itharry started picking up books and throwing them hastily into his trunk tonks paused at his open wardrobe to look critically at her reflection in the mirror on the inside of the dooryou know i dont think violets really my colour she said pensively tugging at a lock of spiky hair dyou think it makes me look a bit peakyer said harry looking up at her over the top of quidditch teams of britain and irelandyeah it does said tonks decisively she screwed up her eyes in a strained expression as though she was struggling to remember something a second later her hair had turned bubblegum pinkhow did you do that said harry gaping at her as she opened her eyes againim a metamorphmagus she said looking back at her reflection and turning her head so that she could see her hair from all directions it means i can change my appearance at will she added spotting harrys puzzled expression in the mirror behind her i was born one i got top marks in concealment and disguise during auror training without any study at all it was greatyoure an auror said harry impressed being a darkwizardcatcher was the only career hed ever considered after hogwartsyeah said tonks looking proud kingsley is as well hes a bit higher up than me though i only qualified a year ago nearly failed on stealth and tracking im dead clumsy did you hear me break that plate when we arrived downstairscan you learn how to be a metamorphmagus harry asked her straightening up completely forgetting about packingtonks chuckledbet you wouldnt mind hiding that scar sometimes ehher eyes found the lightningshaped scar on harrys foreheadno i wouldnt mind harry mumbled turning away he did rot like people staring at his scarwell youll have to learn the hard way im afraid said tonks metamorphmagi are really rare theyre born not made most wizards reed to use a wand or potions to change their appearance but weve got to get going harry were supposed to be packing she added guiltily looking around at all the mess on the flooroh yeah said harry grabbing a few more booksdont be stupid itll be much quicker if i pack cried tonks waving her wand in a long sweeping movement over the floorbooks clothes telescope and scales all soared into the air and flew pellmell into the trunkits not very neat said tonks walking over to the trunk and looking down at the jumble inside my mums got this knack of getting stuff to fit itself in neatly she even gets the socks to fold themselves but ive never mastered how she does it its a kind of flick she flicked her wand hopefullyone of harrys socks gave a feeble sort of wiggle and flopped back on top of the mess in the trunkah well said tonks slamming the trunks lid shut at least its all in that could do with a bit of cleaning too she pointed her wand at hedwigs cage scourgify a few feathers and droppings vanished well thats a bit better ive never quite got the hang of these householdy sort of spells right got everything cauldron broom wow a firebolther eyes widened as they fell on the broomstick in harrys right hand it was his pride and joy a gift from sirius an internationalstandard broomstickand im still riding a comet two sixty said tonks enviously ah well wand still in your jeans both buttocks still on ok lets go locomotor trunkharrys trunk rose a few inches into the air holding her wand like a conductors baton tonks made the trunk hover across the room and out of the door ahead of them hedwigs cage in her left hand harry followed her down the stairs carrying his broomstickback in the kitchen moody had replaced his eye which was spinning so fast after its cleaning it made harry feel sick to look at it kingsley shacklebolt and sturgis podmore were examining the microwave and hestia jones was laughing at a potato peeler she had come across while rummaging in the drawers lupin was sealing a letter addressed to the dursleysexcellent said lupin looking up as tonks and harry entered weve got about a minute i think we should probably get out into the garden so were ready harry ive left a letter telling your aunt and uncle not to worry they wont said harrythat youre safe thatll just depress themand youll see them next summerdo i have tolupin smiled but made no answercome here boy said moody gruffly beckoning harry towards him with his wand i need to disillusion youyou need to what said harry nervouslydisillusionment charm said moody raising his wand lupin says youve got an invisibility cloak but it wont stay on while were flying thisll disguise you better here you go he rapped him hard on the top of the head and harry felt a curious sensation as though moody had just smashed an egg there cold trickles seemed to be running down his body from the point the wand had strucknice one madeye said tonks appreciatively staring at harrys midriffharry looked down at his body or rather what had been his body for it didnt look anything like his any more it was not invisible it had simply taken on the exact colour and texture of the kitchen unit behind him he seemed to have become a human chameleoncome on said moody unlocking the back door with his wandthey all stepped outside on to uncle vernons beautifully kept lawnclear night grunted moody his magical eye scanning the heavens couldve done with a bit more cloud cover right you he barked at harry were going to be flying in close formation tonksll be right in front of you keep close on her tail lupinll be covering you from below im going to be behind you the restll be circling us we dont break ranks for anything got me if one of us is killed is that likely harry asked apprehensively but moody ignored himthe others keep flying dont stop dont break ranks if they take out all of us and you survive harry the rear guard are standing by to take over keep flying east and theyll join youstop being so cheerful madeye hell think were not taking this seriously said tonks as she strapped harrys trunk and hedwigs cage into a harness hanging from her broomim just telling the boy the plan growled moody our jobs to deliver him safely to headquarters and if we die in the attempt no ones going to die said kingsley shacklebolt in his deep calming voicemount your brooms thats the first signal said lupin sharply pointing into the skyfar far above them a shower of bright red sparks had flared among the stars harry recognised them at once as wand sparks he swung his right leg over his firebolt gripped its handle tightly and felt it vibrating very slightly as though it was as keen as he was to be up in the air once moresecond signal lets go said lupin loudly as more sparks green this time exploded high above themharry kicked off hard from the ground the cool night air rushed through his hair as the neat square gardens of privet drive fell away shrinking rapidly into a patchwork of dark greens and blacks and every thought of the ministry hearing was swept from his mind as though the rush of air had blown it out of his head he felt as though his heart was going to explode with pleasure he was flying again flying away from privet drive as hed been fantasising about all summer he was going home for a few glorious moments all his problems seemed to recede to nothing insignificant in the vast starry skyhard left hard left theres a muggle looking up shouted moody from behind him tonks swerved and harry followed her watching his trunk swinging wildly beneath her broom we need more height give it another quarter of a mileharrys eyes watered in the chill as they soared upwards he could see nothing below now but tiny pinpricks of light that were car headlights and streetlamps two of those tiny lights might belong to uncle vernons car the dursleys would be heading back to their empty house right now full of rage about the nonexistent lawn competition and harry laughed aloud at the thought though his voice was drowned by the flapping robes of the others the creaking of the harness holding his trunk and the cage and the whoosh of the wind in their ears as they sped through the air he had not felt this alive in a month or this happybearing south shouted madeye town aheadthey soared right to avoid passing directly over the glittering spiders web of lights belowbear southeast and keep climbing theres some low cloud ahead we can lose ourselves in called moodywere not going through clouds shouted tonks angrily well get soaked madeyeharry was relieved to hear her say this his hands were growing numb on the firebolts handle he wished he had thought to put on a coat he was starting to shiverthey altered their course every now and then according to madeyes instructions harrys eyes were screwed up against the rush of icy wind that was starting to make his ears ache he could remember being this cold on a broom only once before during the quidditch match against hufflepuff in his third year which had taken place in a storm the guard around him was circling continuously like giant birds of prey harry lost track of time he wondered how long they had been flying it felt like an hour at leastturning southwest yelled moody we want to avoid the motorwayharry was now so chilled he thought longingly of the snug dry interiors of the cars streaming along below then even more longingly of travelling by floo powder it might be uncomfortable to spin around in fireplaces but it was at least warm in the flames kingsley shacklebolt swooped around him bald pate and earring gleaming slightly in the moonlight now emmeline vance was on his right her wand out her head turning left and right then she too swooped over him to be replaced by sturgis podmore we ought to double back for a bit just to make sure were not being followed moody shoutedare you mad madeye tonks screamed from the front were all frozen to our brooms if we keep going offcourse were not going to get there until next week besides were nearly there nowtime to start the descent came lupins voice follow tonks harryharry followed tonks into a dive they were heading for the largest collection of lights he had yet seen a huge sprawling crisscrossing mass glittering in lines and grids interspersed with patches of deepest black lower and lower they flew until harry could see individual headlights and streetlamps chimneys and television aerials he wanted to reach the ground very much though he felt sure someone would have to unfreeze him from his broomhere we go called tonks and a few seconds later she had landedharry touched down right behind her and dismounted on a patch of unkempt grass in the middle of a small square tonks was already unbuckling harrys trunk shivering harry looked around the grimy fronts of the surrounding houses were not welcoming some of them had broken windows glimmering dully in the light from the streetlamps paint was peeling from many of the doors and heaps of rubbish lay outside several sets of front stepswhere are we harry asked but lupin said quietly in a minutemoody was rummaging in his cloak his gnarled hands clumsy with coldgot it he muttered raising what looked like a silver cigarette lighter into the air and clicking itthe nearest streetlamp went out with a pop he clicked the unlighter again the next lamp went out he kept clicking until every lamp in the square was extinguished and the only remaining light came from curtained windows and the sickle moon overheadborrowed it from dumbledore growled moody pocketing the putouter thatll take care of any muggles looking out of the window see now come on quickhe took harry by the arm and led him from the patch of grass across the road and on to the pavement lupin and tonks followed carrying harrys trunk between them the rest of the guard all with their wands out flanking themthe muffled pounding of a stereo was coming from an upper window in the nearest house a pungent smell of rotting rubbish came from the pile of bulging binbags just inside the broken gatehere moody muttered thrusting a piece of parchment towards harrys disillusioned hand and holding his lit wand close to it so as to illuminate the writing read quickly and memoriseharry looked down at the piece of paper the narrow handwriting was vaguely familiar it saidthe headquarters of the order of the phoenix may be found at number twelve grimmauld place londonchapter four number twelvegrimmauld placewhats the order of the harry begannot here boy snarled moody wait till were insidehe pulled the piece of parchment out of harrys hand and set fire to it with his wandtip as the message curled into flames and floated to the ground harry looked around at the houses again they were standing outside number eleven he looked to the left and saw number ten to the right however was number thirteenbut wheres think about what youve just memorised said lupin quietlyharry thought and no sooner had he reached the part about number twelve grimmauld place than a battered door emerged out of nowhere between numbers eleven and thirteen followed swiftly by dirty walls and grimy windows it was as though an extra house had inflated pushing those on either side out of its way harry gaped at it the stereo in number eleven thudded on apparently the muggles inside hadnt felt anythingcome on hurry growled moody prodding harry in the backharry walked up the worn stone steps staring at the newly materialised door its black paint was shabby and scratched the silver doorknocker was in the form of a twisted serpent there was no keyhole or letterboxlupin pulled out his wand and tapped the door once harry heard many loud metallic clicks and what sounded like the clatter o a chain the door creaked openget in quick harry lupin whispered but dont go far inside and dont touch anythingharry stepped over the threshold into the almost total darkness of the hall he could smell damp dust and a sweetish rotting smell the place had the feeling of a derelict building he looked over his shoulder and saw the others filing in behind him lupin and tonks carrying his trunk and hedwigs cage moody was standing on the top step releasing the balls of light the putouter had stolen from the streetlamps they flew back to their bulbs and the square glowed momentarily with orange light before moody limped inside and closed the front door so that the darkness in the hall became completehere he rapped harry hard over the head with his wand harry felt as though something hot was trickling down his back this time and knew that the disillusionment charm must have liftednow stay still everyone while i give us a bit of light in here moody whisperedthe others hushed voices were giving harry an odd feeling of foreboding it was as though they had just entered the house of a dying person he heard a soft hissing noise and then oldfashioned gas lamps sputtered into life all along the walls casting a flickering insubstantial light over the peeling wallpaper and threadbare carpet of a long gloomy hallway where a cobwebby chandelier glimmered overhead and ageblackened portraits hung crooked on the walls harry heard something scuttling behind the skirting board both the chandelier and the candelabra on a rickety table nearby were shaped like serpentsthere were hurried footsteps and rons mother mrs weasley emerged from a door at the far end of the hall she was beaming in welcome as she hurried towards them though harry noticed that she was rather thinner and paler than she had been last time he had seen heroh harry its lovely to see you she whispered pulling him into a ribcracking hug before holding him at arms length and examining him critically youre looking peaky you need feeding up but youll have to wait a bit for dinner im afraidshe turned to the gang of wizards behind him and whispered urgently hes just arrived the meetings startedthe wizards behind harry all made noises of interest and excitement and began filing past him towards the door through which mrs weasley had just come harry made to follow lupin but mrs weasley held him backno harry the meetings only for members of the order ron and hermione are upstairs you can wait with them until the meetings over then well have dinner and keep your voice down in the hall she added in an urgent whisperwhyi dont want anything to wake upwhat dyou ill explain later ive got to hurry im supposed to be at the meeting ill just show you where youre sleepingpressing her finger to her lips she led him on tiptoe past a pair of long motheaten curtains behind which harry supposed there must be another door and after skirting a large umbrella stand that looked as though it had been made from a severed trolls leg they started up the dark staircase passing a row of shrunken heads mounted on plaques on the wall a closer look showed harry that the heads belonged to houseelves all of them had the same rather snoutlike noseharrys bewilderment deepened with every step he took what on earth were they doing in a house that looked as though it belonged to the darkest of wizardsmrs weasley why ron and hermione will explain everything dear ive really got to dash mrs weasley whispered distractedly there they had reached the second landing youre the door on the right ill call you when its overand she hurried off downstairs againharry crossed the dingy landing turned the bedroom doorknob which was shaped like a serpents head and opened the doorhe caught a brief glimpse of a gloomy highceilinged twinbedded room then there was a loud twittering noise followed by an even louder shriek and his vision was completely obscured by a large quantity of very bushy hair hermione had thrown herself on to him in a hug that nearly knocked him flat while rons tiny owl pigwidgeon zoomed excitedly round and round their headsharry ron hes here harrys here we didnt hear you arrive oh how are you are you all right have you been furious with us i bet you have i know our letters were useless but we couldnt tell you anything dumbledore made us swear we wouldnt oh weve got so much to tell you and youve got things to tell us the dementors when we heard and that ministry hearing its just outrageous ive looked it all up they cant expel you they just cant theres provision in the decree for the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery for the use of magic in lifethreatening situations let him breathe hermione said ron grinning as he closed the door behind harry he seemed to have grown several more inches during their month apart making him taller and more gangly looking than ever though the long nose bright red hair and freckles were the samestill beaming hermione let go of harry but before she could say another word there was a soft whooshing sound and something white soared from the top of a dark wardrobe and landed gently on harrys shoulderhedwigthe snowy owl clicked her beak and nibbled his ear affectionately as harry stroked her feathersshes been in a right state said ron pecked us half to death when she brought your last letters look at this he showed harry the index finger of his right hand which sported a halfhealed but clearly deep cutoh yeah harry said sorry about that but i wanted answers you know we wanted to give them to you mate said ron hermione was going spare she kept saying youd do something stupid if you were stuck all on your own without news but dumbledore made us swear not to tell me said harry yeah hermiones already saidthe warm glow that had flared inside him at the sight of his two best friends was extinguished as something icy flooded the pit of his stomach all of a sudden after yearning to see them for a solid month he felt he would rather ron and hermione left him alonethere was a strained silence in which harry stroked hedwig automatically not looking at either of the othershe seemed to think it was best said hermione rather breathlessly dumbledore i meanright said harry he noticed that her hands too bore the marks of hedwigs beak and found that he was not at all sorryi think he thought you were safest with the muggles ron beganyeah said harry raising his eyebrows have either of you been attacked by dementors this summerwell no but thats why hes had people from the order of the phoenix tailing you all the time harry felt a great jolt in his guts as though he had just missed a step going downstairs so everyone had known he was being followed except himdidnt work that well though did it said harry doing his utmost to keep his voice even had to look after myself after all didnt ihe was so angry said hermione in an almost awestruck voice dumbledore we saw him when he found out mundungus had left before his shift had ended he was scarywell im glad he left harry said coldly ii he hadnt i wouldnt have done magic and dumbledore would probably have left me at privet drive all summerarent you arent you worried about the ministry of magic hearing said hermione quietlyno harry lied defiantly he walked away from them looking around with hedwig nestled contentedly on his shoulder but this room was not likely to raise his spirits it was dank and dark a blank stretch of canvas in an ornate picture frame was all that relieved the bareness of the peeling walls and as harry passed it he thought he heard someone who was lurking out of sight sniggerso whys dumbledore been so keen to keep me in the darkharry asked still trying hard to keep his voice casual did you er bother to ask him at allhe glanced up just in time to see them exchanging a look that told him he was behaving just as they had feared he would it did nothing to improve his temperwe told dumbledore we wanted to tell you what was going on said ron we did mate but hes really busy now weve only seen him twice since we came here and he didnt have much time he just made us swear not to tell you important stuff when we wrote he said the owls might be interceptedhe could stillve kept me informed if hed wanted to harry said shortly youre not telling me he doesnt know ways to send messages without owlshermione glanced at ron and then said i thought that too but he didnt want you to know anythingmaybe he thinks i cant be trusted said harry watching their expressionsdont be thick said ron looking highly disconcertedor that i cant take care of myselfof course he doesnt think that said hermione anxiouslyso how come i have to stay at the dursleys while you two get to join in everything thats going on here said harry the words tumbling over one another in a rush his voice growing louder with every word how come you two are allowed to know everything thats going onwere not ron interrupted mum wont let us near the meetings she says were too young but before he knew it harry was shoutingso you havent been in the meetings big deal youve still been here havent you youve still been together me ive been stuck at the dursleys for a month and ive handled more than you twove ever managed and dumbledore knows it who saved the philosophers stone who got rid of riddle who saved both your skins from the dementorsevery bitter and resentful thought harry had had in the past month was pouring out of him his frustration at the lack of news the hurt that they had all been together without him his fury at being followed and not told about it all the feelings he was halfashamed of finally burst their boundaries hedwig took fright at the noise and soared off to the top of the wardrobe again pigwidgeon twittered in alarm and zoomed even faster around their headswho had to get past dragons and sphinxes and every other foul thing last year who saw him come back who had to escape from him meron was standing there with his mouth halfopen clearly stunned and at a loss for anything to say whilst hermione looked on the verge of tearsbut why should i know whats going on why should anyone bother to tell me whats been happeningharry we wanted to tell you we really did hermione begancantve wanted to that much can you or youd have sent me an owl but dumbledore made you swear well he did four weeks ive been stuck in privet drive nicking papers out of bins to try and find out whats been going on we wanted to i suppose youve been having a real laugh havent you all holed up here together no honest harry were really sorry said hermione desperately her eyes now sparkling with tears youre absolutely right harry id be furious if it was meharry glared at her still breathing deeply then turned away from them again pacing up and down hedwig hooted glumly from the top of the wardrobe there was a long pause broken only by the mournful creak of the floorboards below harrys feetwhat is this place anyway he shot at ron and hermioneheadquarters of the order of the phoenix said ron at onceis anyone going to bother telling me what the order of the phoenix its a secret society said hermione quickly dumbledores in charge he founded it its the people who fought against youknowwho last timewhos in it said harry coming to a halt with his hands in his pocketsquite a few people weve met about twenty of them said ron but we think there are moreharry glared at themwell he demanded looking from one to the otherer said ron well whatvoldemort said harry furiously and both ron and hermione winced whats happening whats he up to where is he what are we doing to stop himweve told you the order dont let us in on their meetings said hermione nervously so we dont know the details but weve got a general idea she added hastily seeing the look on harrys facefred and george have invented extendable ears see said ron theyre really usefulextendable ears yeah only weve had to stop using them lately because mum found out and went berserk fred and george had to hide them all to stop mum binning them but we got a good bit of use out of them before mum realised what was going on we know some of the order are following known death eaters keeping tabs on them you know some of them are working on recruiting more people to the order said hermioneand some of them are standing guard over something said ron theyre always talking about guard dutycouldnt have been me could it said harry sarcasticallyoh yeah said ron with a look of dawning comprehensionharry snorted he walked around the room again looking anywhere but at ron and hermione so what have you two been doing if youre not allowed in meetings he demanded you said youd been busywe have said hermione quickly weve been decontaminating this house its been empty for ages and stuffs been breeding in here weve managed to clean out the kitchen most of the bedrooms and i think were doing the drawing room tomo aarghwith two loud cracks fred and george rons elder twin brothers had materialised out of thin air in the middle of the room pigwidgeon twittered more wildly than ever and zoomed off to join hedwig on top of the wardrobestop doing that hermione said weakly to the twins who were as vividly redhaired as ron though stockier and slightly shorterhello harry said george beaming at him we thought we heard your dulcet tonesyou dont want to bottle up your anger like that harry let it all out said fred also beaming there might be a couple of people fifty miles away who didnt hear youyou two passed your apparation tests then asked harry grumpilywith distinction said fred who was holding what looked like a piece of very long fleshcoloured stringit would have taken you about thirty seconds longer to walk down the stairs said rontime is galleons little brother said fred anyway harry youre interfering with reception extendable ears he added in response to harrys raised eyebrows and held up the string which harry now saw was trailing out on to the landing were trying to hear whats going on downstairsyou want to be careful said ron staring at the ear if mum sees one of them again its worth the risk thats a major meeting theyre having said redthe door opened and a long mane of red hair appearedoh hello harry said rons younger sister ginny brightly i thought i heard your voiceturning to fred and george she said its nogo with the extendable ears shes gone and put an imperturbable charm on the kitchen doorhow dyou know said george looking crestfallentonks told me how to find out said ginny you just chuck stuff at the door and if it cant make contact the doors been imperturbed ive been flicking dungbombs at it from the top of the stairs and they just soar away from it so theres no way the extendable ears will be able to get under the gapfred heaved a deep sighshame i really fancied finding out what old snapes been up tosnape said harry quickly is he hereyeah said george carefully closing the door and sitting down on one of the beds fred and ginny followed giving a report top secretgit said fred idlyhes on our side now said hermione reprovinglyron snorted doesnt stop him being a git the way he looks at us when he sees usbill doesnt like him either said ginny as though that settled the matterharry was not sure his anger had abated yet but his thirst for information was now overcoming his urge to keep shouting he sank on to the bed opposite the othersis bill here he asked i thought he was working in egypthe applied for a desk job so he could come home and work for the order said fred he says he misses the tombs but he smirked there are compensationswhat dyou meanremember old fleur delacour said george shes got a job at gringotts to eemprove er eeenglish and bills been giving her a lot of private lessons sniggered fredcharlies in the order too said george but hes still in romania dumbledore wants as many foreign wizards brought in as possible so charlies trying to make contacts on his days offcouldnt percy do that harry asked the last he had heard the third weasley brother was working in the department of international magical cooperation at the ministry of magicat harrys words all the weasleys and hermione exchanged darkly significant lookswhatever you do dont mention percy in front of mum and dad ron told harry in a tense voicewhy notbecause every time percys names mentioned dad breaks whatever hes holding and mum starts crying fred saidits been awful said ginny sadlyi think were well shot of him said george with an uncharacteristically ugly look on his facewhats happened harry saidpercy and dad had a row said fred ive never seen dad row with anyone like that its normally mum who shoutsit was the first week back after term ended said ron we were about to come and join the order percy came home and told us hed been promotedyoure kidding said harrythough he knew perfectly well that percy was highly ambitious harrys impression was that percy had not made a great success of his first job at the ministry of magic percy had committed the fairly large oversight of failing to notice that his boss was being controlled by lord voldemort not that the ministry had believed it they all thought mr crouch had gone madyeah we were all surprised said george because percy got into a load of trouble about crouch there was an inquiry and everything they said percy ought to have realised crouch was off his rocker and informed a superior but you know percy crouch left him in charge he wasnt going to complainso how come they promoted himthats exactly what we wondered said ron who seemed very keen to keep normal conversation going now that harry had stopped yelling he came home really pleased with himself even more pleased than usual if you can imagine that and told dad hed been offered a position in fudges own office a really good one for someone only a year out of hogwarts junior assistant to the minister he expected dad to be all impressed i thinkonly dad wasnt said fred grimlywhy not said harrywell apparently fudge has been storming round the ministry checking that nobodys having any contact with dumbledore said georgedumbledores name is mud with the ministry these days see said fred they all think hes just making trouble saying youknowwhos backdad says fudge has made it clear that anyone whos in league with dumbledore can clear out their desks said georgetrouble is fudge suspects dad he knows hes friendly with dumbledore and hes always thought dads a bit of a weirdo because of his muggle obsessionbut whats that got to do with percy asked harry confusedim coming to that dad reckons fudge only wants percy in his office because he wants to use him to spy on the family and dumbledoreharry let out a low whistlebet percy loved thatron laughed in a hollow sort of wayhe went completely berserk he said well he said loads of terrible stuff he said hes been having to struggle against dads lousy reputation ever since he joined the ministry and that dads got no ambition and thats why weve always been you know not had a lot of money i mean what said harry in disbelief as ginny made a noise like an angry cati know said ron in a low voice and it got worse he said dad was an idiot to run around with dumbledore that dumbledore was heading for big trouble and dad was going to go down with him and that he percy knew where his loyalty lay and it was with the ministry and if mum and dad were going to become traitors to the ministry he was going to make sure everyone knew he didnt belong to our family any more and he packed his bags the same night and left hes living here in london nowharry swore under his breath he had always liked percy least of rons brothers but he had never imagined he would say such things to mr weasleymums been in a right state said ron dully you know crying and stuff she came up to london to try and talk to percy but he slammed the door in her face i dunno what he does if he meets dad at work ignores him i sposebut percy must know voldemorts back said harry slowly hes not stupid he must know your mum and dad wouldnt risk everything without proofyeah well your name got dragged into the row said ron shooting harry a furtive look percy said the only evidence was your word and i dunno he didnt think it was good enoughpercy takes the daily prophet seriously said hermione tartly and the others all noddedwhat are you talking about harry asked looking around at them all they were all regarding him warilyhavent havent you been getting the daily prophet hermione asked nervouslyyeah i have said harryhave you er been reading it thoroughly hermione asked still more anxiouslynot cover to cover said harry defensively if they were going to report anything about voldemort it would be headline news wouldnt itthe others flinched at the sound of the name hermione hurried on well youd need to read it cover to cover to pick it up but they um they mention you a couple of times a weekbut id have seen not if youve only been reading the front page you wouldnt said hermione shaking her head im not talking about big articles they just slip you in like youre a standing jokewhat dyou its quite nasty actually said hermione in a voice of forced calm theyre just building on ritas stuffbut shes not writing for them any more is sheoh no shes kept her promise not that shes got any choice hermione added with satisfaction but she laid the foundation for what theyre trying to do nowwhich is what said harry impatientlyok you know she wrote that you were collapsing all over the place and saying your scar was hurting and all thatyeah said harry who was not likely to forget rita skeeters stories about him in a hurrywell theyre writing about you as though youre this deluded attentionseeking person who thinks hes a great tragic hero or something said hermione very fast as though it would be less unpleasant for harry to hear these facts quickly they keep slipping in snide comments about you if some farfetched story appears they say something like a tale worthy of harry potter and if anyone has a funny accident or anything its lets hope he hasnt got a scar on his forehead or well be asked to worship him next i dont want anyone to worship harry began hotlyi know you dont said hermione quickly looking frightened i know harry but you see what theyre doing they want to turn you into someone nobody will believe fudge is behind it ill bet anything they want wizards on the street to think youre just some stupid boy whos a bit of a joke who tells ridiculous tall stories because he loves being famous and wants to keep it goingi didnt ask i didnt want voldemort killed my parents harry spluttered i got famous because he murdered my family but couldnt kill me who wants to be famous for that dont i hey think id rather itd never we know harry said ginny earnestlyand of course they didnt report a word about the dementors attacking you said hermione someones told them to keep that quiet that shouldve been a really big story outofcontrol dementors they havent even reported that you broke the international statute of secrecy we thought they would it would be in so well with this image of you as some stupid showoff we think theyre biding their time until youre expelled then theyre really going to go to town i mean if youre expelled obviously she went on hastily you really shouldnt be not if they abide by their own laws theres no case against youthey were back on the hearing and harry did not want to think about that he cast around for another change of subject but was saved the necessity of finding one by the sound of footsteps coming up the stairsuh ohfred gave the extendable ear a hearty tug there was another loud crack and he and george vanished seconds later mrs weasley appeared in the bedroom doorwaythe meetings over you can come down and have dinner now everyones dying to see you harry and whos left all those dungbombs outside the kitchen doorcrookshanks said ginny unblushingly he loves playing with themoh said mrs weasley i thought it might have been kreacher he keeps doing odd things like that now dont forget to keep your voices down in the hall ginny your hands are filthy what have you been doing go and wash them before dinner pleaseginny grimaced at the others and followed her mother out of the room leaving harry alone with ron and hermione both of them were watching him apprehensively as though they feared he would start shouting again now that everyone else had gone the sight of them looking so nervous made him feel slightly ashamedlook he muttered but ron shook his head and hermione said quietly we knew youd be angry harry we really dont blame you but youve got to understand we did try to persuade dumbledore yeah i know said harry shortlyhe cast around for a topic that didnt involve his headmaster because the very thought of dumbledore made harrys insides burn with anger againwhos kreacher he askedthe houseelf who lives here said ron nutter never met one like himhermione frowned at ronhes not a nutter ronhis lifes ambition is to have his head cut off and stuck up on plaque just like his mother said ron irritably is that normal hermionewell well if he is a bit strange its not his faultron rolled his eyes at harryhermione still hasnt given up on spewits not spew said hermione heatedly its the society for the promotion of elfish welfare and its not just me dumbledore says we should be kind to kreacher tooyeah yeah said ron cmon im starvinghe led the way out of the door and on to the landing but be ore they could descend the stairs hold it ron breathed flinging out an arm to stop harry and hermione walking any further theyre still in the hall we might be able to hear somethingthe three of them looked cautiously over the banisters the gloomy hallway below was packed with witches and wizards including all of harrys guard they were whispering excitedly together in the very centre of the group harry saw the dark greasyhaired head and prominent nose of his least favourite teacher at hogwarts professor snape harry leant further over the banisters he was very interested in what snape was doing for the order of the phoenix a thin piece of fleshcoloured string descended in front of harrys eyes looking up he saw fred and george on the landing above cautiously lowering the extendable ear towards the dark knot of people below a moment later however they all began to move towards the front door and out of sightdammit harry heard fred whisper as he hoisted the extendable ear back up againthey heard the front door open then closesnape never eats here ron told harry quietly thank clod cmonand dont forget to keep your voice down in the hall harry hermione whisperedas they passed the row of houseelf heads on the wall they saw lupin mrs weasley and tonks at the front door magically sealing its many locks and bolts behind those who had just leftwere eating down in the kitchen mrs weasley whispered meeting them at the bottom of the stairs harry dear if youll just tiptoe across the hall its through this door here crashtonks cried mrs weasley in exasperation turning to look behind herim sorry wailed tonks who was lying flat on the floor its that stupid umbrella stand thats the second time ive tripped over but the rest of her words were drowned by a horrible earsplitting bloodcurdling screechthe motheaten velvet curtains harry had passed earlier had flown apart but there was no door behind them for a split second harry thought he was looking through a window a window behind which an old woman in a black cap was screaming and screaming as though she were being tortured then he realised it was simply a lifesize portrait but the most realistic and the most unpleasant he had ever seen in his lifethe old woman was drooling her eyes were rolling the yellowing skin of her face stretched taut as she screamed and all along the hall behind them the other portraits awoke and began to yell too so that harry actually screwed up his eyes at the noise and clapped his hands over his earslupin and mrs weasley darted forward and tried to tug the curtains shut over the old woman but they would not close and she screeched louder than ever brandishing clawed hands as though trying to tear at their facesfilth scum byproducts of dirt and vileness halfbreeds mutants freaks begone from this place how dare you befoul the house of my fathers tonks apologised over and over again dragging the huge heavy trolls leg back off the floor mrs weasley abandoned the attempt to close the curtains and hurried up and down the hall stunning all the other portraits with her wand and a man with long black hair came charging out of a door facing harryshut up you horrible old hag shut up he roared seizing the curtain mrs weasley had abandonedthe old womans face blanchedyoooou she howled her eyes popping at the sight of the man blood traitor abomination shame of my fleshi said shut up roared the man and with a stupendous effort he and lupin managed to force the curtains closed againthe old womans screeches died and an echoing silence tell panting slightly and sweeping his long dark hair out of his eyes harrys godfather sirius turned to face himhello harry he said grimly i see youve met my motherchapter five the order of the phoenixyour my dear old mum yeah said sirius weve been trying to get her down for a month but we think she put a permanent sticking charm on the back of the canvas lets get downstairs quick before they all wake up againbut whats a portrait of your mother doing here harry asked bewildered as they went through the door from the hall and led the way down a flight of narrow stone steps the others just behind themhasnt anyone told you this was my parents house said sirius but im the last black left so its mine now i offered it to dumbledore for headquarters about the only useful thing ive been able to doharry who had expected a better welcome noted how hard and bitter siriuss voice sounded he followed his godfather to the bottom of the steps and through a door leading into the basement kitchenit was scarcely less gloomy than the hall above a cavernous room with rough stone walls most of the light was coming from a large fire at the far end of the room a haze of pipe smoke hung in the air like battle fumes through which loomed the menacing shapes of heavy iron pots and pans hanging from the dark ceiling many chairs had been crammed into the room for the meeting and a long wooden table stood in the middle of them littered with rolls of parchment goblets empty wine bottles and a heap of what appeared to be rags mr weasley and his eldest son bill were talking quietly with their heads together at the end of the tablemrs weasley cleared her throat her husband a thin balding redhaired man who wore hornrimmed glasses looked around and jumped to his feetharry mr weasley said hurrying forward to greet him and shaking his hand vigorously good to see youover his shoulder harry saw bill who still wore his long hair in a ponytail hastily rolling up the lengths of parchment left on the tablejourney all right harry bill called trying to gather up twelve scrolls at once madeye didnt make you come via greenland thenhe tried said tonks striding over to help bill and immediately toppling a candle on to the last piece of parchment oh no sorry here dear said mrs weasley sounding exasperated and she repaired the parchment with a wave of her wand in the flash of light caused by mrs weasleys charm harry caught a glimpse of what looked like the plan of a buildingmrs weasley had seen him looking she snatched the plan off the table and stuffed it into bills already overladen armsthis sort of thing ought to be cleared away promptly at the end of meetings she snapped before sweeping off towards an ancient dresser from which she started unloading dinner platesbill took out his wand muttered evanesce and the scrolls vanishedsit down harry said sirius youve met mundungus havent youthe thing harry had taken to be a pile of rags gave a prolonged grunting snore then jerked awakesomen say mname mundungus mumbled sleepily i agree with sirius he raised a very grubby hand in the air as though voting his droopy bloodshot eyes unfocusedginny giggledthe meetings over dung said sirius as they all sat down around him at the table harrys arrivedeh said mundungus peering bale fully at harry through his matted ginger hair blimey so e as yeah you all right airyyeah said harrymundungus fumbled nervously in his pockets still staring at harry and pulled out a grimy black pipe he stuck it in his mouth ignited the end of it with his wand and took a deep pull on it great billowing clouds of greenish smoke obscured him within secondsowe you a pology grunted a voice from the middle of the smelly cloudfor the last time mundungus called mrs weasley will you please not smoke that thing in the kitchen especially not when were about to eatah said mundungus right sorry mollythe cloud of smoke vanished as mundungus stowed his pipe back in his pocket but an acrid smell of burning socks lingeredand if you want dinner before midnight ill need a hand mrs weasley said to the room at large no you can stay where you are harry dear youve had a long journeywhat can i do molly said tonks enthusiastically bounding forwardsmrs weasley hesitated looking apprehensiveer no its all right tonks you have a rest too youve done enough todayno no i want to help said tonks brightly knocking over a chair as she hurried towards the dresser from which ginny was collecting cutlerysoon a series of heavy knives were chopping meat and vegetables of their own accord supervised by mr weasley while mrs weasley stirred a cauldron dangling over the fire and the others took out plates more goblets and food from the pantry harry was left at the table with sirius and mundungus who was still blinking at him mournfullyseen old figgy since he askedno said harry i havent seen anyonesee i wouldnt ave left said mundungus leaning forward a pleading note in his voice but i ad a business opportunity harry felt something brush against his knees and started but it was only crookshanks hermiones bandylegged ginger cat who wound himself once around harrys legs purring then jumped on to siriuss lap and curled up sirius scratched him absentmindedly behind the ears as he turned still grimfaced to harryhad a good summer so farno its been lousy said harryfor the first time something like a grin flitted across siriuss freedont know what youre complaining about myselfwhat said harry incredulouslypersonally id have welcomed a dementor attack a deadly struggle for my soul would have broken the monotony nicely you think youve had it bad at least youve been able to get out and about stretch your legs get into a few fights ive been stuck inside for a monthhow come asked harry frowningbecause the ministry of magics still after me and voldemort will know all about me being an animagus by now wormtail will have told him so my big disguise is useless theres not much i can do for the order of the phoenix or so dumbledore feelsthere was something about the slightly flattened tone of voice in which sirius uttered dumbledores name that told harry that sirius too was not very happy with the headmaster harry felt a sudden upsurge of affection for his godfatherat least youve known whats been going on he said bracinglyoh yeah said sirius sarcastically listening to snapes reports having to take all his snide hints that hes out there risking his life while im sat on my backside here having a nice comfortable time asking me how the cleanings going what cleaning asked harrytrying to make this place fit for human habitation said sirius waving a hand around the dismal kitchen no ones lived here for ten years not since my dear mother died unless you count her old houseelf and hes gone round the twist hasnt cleaned anything in agessirius said mundungus who did not appear to have paid any attention to the conversation but had been closely examining an empty goblet this solid silver mateyes said sirius surveying it with distaste finest fifteenthcentury goblinwrought silver embossed with the black family crestthatd come orf though muttered mundungus polishing it with his cufffred george no just carry them mrs weasley shriekedharry sirius and mundungus looked round and within a split second they had dived away from the table fred and george had bewitched a large cauldron of stew an iron flagon of butterbeer and a heavy wooden breadboard complete with knife to hurtle through the air towards them the stew skidded the length of the table and came to a halt just before the end leaving a long black burn on the wooden surface the flagon of butterbeer fell with a crash spilling its contents everywhere the bread knife slipped off the board and landed point down and quivering ominously exactly where siriuss right hand had been seconds beforefor heavens sake screamed mrs weasley there was no need ive had enough of this just because youre allowed to use magic now you dont have to whip your wands out for every tiny little thingwe were just trying to save a bit of time said fred hurrying forward to wrench the bread knife out of the table sorry sirius mate didnt mean to harry and sirius were both laughing mundungus who had toppled backwards off his chair was swearing as he got to his feet crookshanks had given an angry hiss and shot off under the dresser from where his large yellow eyes glowed in the darknessboys mr weasley said lifting the stew back into the middle of the table your mothers right you re supposed to show a sense f responsibility now youve come of age none of your brothers caused this sort of trouble mrs weasley raged at the twins as she slammed a fresh flagon of butterbeer on lo the table and spilling almost as much again bill didnt feel the need to apparate every few feet charlie didnt charm everything he met percy she stopped dead catching her breath with a frightened look at her husband whose expression was suddenly woodenlets eat said bill quicklyit looks wonderful molly said lupin ladling stew on to a plate lor her and handing it across the tablefor a few minutes there was silence but for the chink of plates and cutlery and the scraping of chairs as everyone settled down to their food then mrs weasley turned to siriusive been meaning to tell you sirius theres something trapped in that writing desk in the drawing room it keeps rattling and shaking of course it could just be a boggart but i thought we ought to ask alastor to have a look at it before we let it outwhatever you like said sirius indifferentlythe curtains in there are full of doxys too mrs weasley went on i thought we might try and tackle them tomorrowi look forward to it said sirius harry heard the sarcasm in his voice but he was not sure that anyone else didopposite harry tonks was entertaining hermione and ginny by transforming her nose between mouthfuls screwing up her eyes each time with the same pained expression she had worn back in harrys bedroom her nose swelled to a beaklike protuberance that resembled snapes shrank to the size of a button mushroom and then sprouted a great deal of hair from each nostril apparently this was a regular mealtime entertainment because hermione and ginny were soon requesting their favourite nosesdo that one like a pig snout tonkstonks obliged and harry looking up had the fleeting impression that a female dudley was grinning at him from across he tablemr weasley bill and lupin were having an intense discuss on about goblinstheyre not giving anything away yet said bill i still cant work out whether or not they believe hes back course they might prefer not to take sides at all keep out of itim sure theyd never go over to youknowwho said mr weasley shaking his head theyve suffered losses too remember that goblin family he murdered last time somewhere near nottinghami think it depends what theyre offered said lupin and im not talking about gold if theyre offered the freedoms weve been denying them for centuries theyre going to be tempted have you still not had any luck with ragnok billhes feeling pretty antiwizard at the moment said bill he hasnt stopped raging about the bagman business he reckons the ministry did a coverup those goblins never got their gold from him you know a gale of laughter from the middle of the table drowned the rest of bills words fred george ron and mundungus were rolling around in their seatsand then choked mundungus tears running down his face and then if youll believe it e says to me e says ere dung where didja get all them toads from cos some son of a sludgers gone and nicked all mine and i says nicked all your toads will what next so youll be wanting some more then and if youll believe me lads the gormless gargoyle buys all is own toads back orf me for a lot moren what e paid in the first place i dont think we need to hear any more of your business dealings thank you very much mundungus said mrs weasley sharply as ron slumped forwards on to the table howling with laughterbeg pardon molly said mundungus at once wiping his eyes and winking at harry but you know will nicked em orf warty harris in the first place so i wasnt really doing nothing wrongi dont know where you learned about right and wrong mundungus but you seem to have missed a few crucial lessons said mrs weasley coldlyfred and george buried their faces in their goblets of butterbeer george was hiccoughing for some reason mrs weasley threw a very nasty look at sirius before getting to her feet and going to fetch a large rhubarb crumble for pudding harry looked round at his godfathermolly doesnt approve of mundungus said sirius in an undertonehow come hes in the order harry said very quietlyhes useful sirius muttered knows all the crooks well he would seeing as hes one himself but hes also very loyal to dumbledore who helped him out of a tight spot once it pays to have someone like dung around he hears things we dont but molly thinks inviting him to stay for dinner is going too far she hasnt forgiven him for slipping off duty when he was supposed to be tailing youthree helpings of rhubarb crumble and custard later and i he waistband on harrys jeans was feeling uncomfortably tight which was saying something as the jeans had once been dudleys as he laid down his spoon there was a lull in the general conversation mr weasley was leaning back in his chair looking replete and relaxed tonks was yawning widely her nose now back to normal and ginny who had lured crookshanks out from under the dresser was sitting crosslegged on the floor rolling butterbeer corks for him to chasenearly time for bed i think said mrs weasley with a yawnnot just yet molly said sirius pushing away his empty plate and turning to look at harry you know im surprised at you i thought the first thing youd do when you got here would be to start asking questions about voldemortthe atmosphere in the room changed with the rapidity harry associated with the arrival of dementors where seconds before it had been sleepily relaxed it was now alert even tense a frisson had gone around the table at the mention of voldemorts name lupin who had been about to take a sip of wine lowered his goblet slowly looking waryi did said harry indignantly i asked ron and hermione but they said were not allowed in the order so and theyre quite right said mrs weasley youre too youngshe was sitting bolt upright in her chair her fists clenched an its arms every trace of drowsiness gonesince when did someone have to be in the order of the phoenix to ask questions asked sirius harrys been trapped in that muggle house for a month hes got the right to know whats been happenhang on interrupted george loudlyhow come harry gets his questions answered said fred angrilyweve been trying to get stuff out of you for a month and y du havent told us a single stinking thing said georgeyoure too young youre not in the order said fred in a highpitched voice that sounded uncannily like his mothers harrys not even of ageits not my fault you havent been told what the orders doing said sirius calmly thats your parents decision harry on the other hand its not down to you to decide whats good for harry said mrs weasley sharply the expression on her normally kind face looked dangerous you havent forgotten what dumbledore said i supposewhich bit sirius asked politely but with the air of a man readying himself for a fightthe bit about not telling harry more than he needs to know said mrs weasley placing a heavy emphasis on the last three wordsron hermione fred and georges heads swivelled from sirius to mrs weasley as though they were following a tennis rally ginny was kneeling amid a pile of abandoned butterbeer corks watching the conversation with her mouth slightly open lupins eyes were fixed on siriusi dont intend to tell him more than he needs to know molly said sirius but as he was the one who saw voldemort come back again there was a collective shudder around the table at the name he has more right than most to hes not a member of the order of the phoenix said mrs weasley hes only fifteen and and hes dealt with as much as most in the order said sirius and more than someno ones denying what hes done said mrs weasley her voice rising her fists trembling on the arms of her chair but hes still hes not a child said sirius impatientlyhes not an adult either said mrs weasley the colour rising in her cheeks hes not james siriusim perfectly clear who he is thanks molly said sirius coldlyim not sure you are said mrs weasley sometimes the way you talk about him its as though you think youve got your best friend backwhats wrong with that said harrywhats wrong harry is that you are not your father however much you might look like him said mrs weasley her eyes still boring into sirius you are still at school and adults responsible for you should not forget itmeaning im an irresponsible godfather demanded sirius his voice risingmeaning you have been known to act rashly sirius which is why dumbledore keeps reminding you to stay at home and well leave my instructions from dumbledore out of this if you please said sirius loudlyarthur said mrs weasley rounding on her husband arthur back me upmr weasley did not speak at once he took off his glasses and cleaned them slowly on his robes not looking at his wife only when he had replaced them carefully on his nose did he replydumbledore knows the position has changed molly he accepts that harry will have to be filled in to a certain extent now that he is staying at headquartersyes but theres a difference between that and inviting him to ask whatever he likespersonally said lupin quietly looking away from sirius at last as mrs weasley turned quickly to him hopeful that finally she was about to get an ally i think it better that harry gets the facts not all the facts molly but the general picture from us rather than a garbled version from othershis expression was mild but harry felt sure lupin at least knew that some extendable ears had survived mrs weasleys purgewell said mrs weasley breathing deeply and looking around the table for support that did not come well i can see i going to be overruled ill just say this dumbledore must have had his reasons for not wanting harry to know too much and speaking as someone who has harrys best interests at heart hes not your son said sirius quietlyhes as good as said mrs weasley fiercely who else has he gothes got meyes said mrs weasley her lip curling the thing is its been rather difficult for you to look after him while youve been locked up in azkaban hasnt itsirius started to rise from his chairmolly youre not the only person at this table who cares about harry said lupin sharply sirius sit downmrs weasleys lower lip was trembling sirius sank slowly back into his chair his face whitei think harry ought to be allowed a say in this lupin continued hes old enough to decide for himselfi want to know whats been going on harry said at oncehe did not look at mrs weasley he had been touched by what she had said about his being as good as a son but he was also impatient with her mollycoddling sirius was right he was not a childvery well said mrs weasley her voice cracking ginny ron hermione fred george i want you out of this kitchen nowthere was instant uproarwere of age fred and george bellowed togetherif harrys allowed why cant i shouted ronmum i want to hear wailed ginnyno shouted mrs weasley standing up her eyes overbright i absolutely forbid molly you cant stop fred and george said mr weasley wearily they are of agetheyre still at schoolbut theyre legally adults now said mr weasley in the same tired voicemrs weasley was now scarlet in the facei oh all right then fred and george can stay but ron harryll tell me and hermione everything you say anyway said ron hotly wont wont you he added uncertainly meeting harrys eyesfor a split second harry considered telling ron that he wouldnt tell him a single word that he could try a taste of being kept in the dark and see how he liked it but the nasty impulse vanished as they looked at each othercourse i will harry saidron and hermione beamedfine shouted mrs weasley fine ginny bedginny did not go quietly they could hear her raging and storming at her mother all the way up the stairs and when she reached the hall mrs blacks earsplitting shrieks were added to the din lupin hurried off to the portrait to restore calm it was only after he had returned closing the kitchen door behind him and taking his seat at the table again that sirius spokeok harry what do you want to knowharry took a deep breath and asked the question that had obsessed him for the last monthwheres voldemort he said ignoring the renewed shudders and winces at the name whats he doing ive been trying to watch the muggle news and there hasnt been anything that looks like him yet no funny deaths or anythingthats because there havent been any funny deaths yet said sirius not as far as we know anyway and we know quite a letmore than he thinks we do anyway said lupinhow come hes stopped killing people harry asked he knew voldemort had murdered more than once in the last year alonebecause he doesnt want to draw attention to himself said sirius it would be dangerous for him his comeback didnt come off quite the way he wanted it to you see he messed it upor rather you messed it up for him said lupin with a satisfied smilehow harry asked perplexedyou werent supposed to survive said sirius nobody apart from his death eaters was supposed to know hed come back but you survived to bear witnessand the very last person he wanted alerted to his return the moment he got back was dumbledore said lupin and you made sure dumbledore knew at oncehow has that helped harry askedare you kidding said bill incredulously dumbledore was the only one youknowwho was ever scared ofthanks to you dumbledore was able to recall the order of the phoenix about an hour after voldemort returned said siriusso whats the order been doing said harry looking around at them allworking as hard as we can to make sure voldemort cant carry out his plans said siriushow dyou know what his plans are harry asked quicklydumbledores got a shrewd idea said lupin and dumbledores shrewd ideas normally turn out to be accurateso what does dumbledore reckon hes planningwell firstly he wants to build up his army again said sirius in the old days he had huge numbers at his command witches and wizards hed bullied or bewitched into following him his faithful death eaters a great variety of dark creatures you heard him planning to recruit the giants well theyll be just one of the groups hes after hes certainly not going to try and take on the ministry of magic with only a dozen death eatersso youre trying to stop him getting more followerswere doing our best said lupinhowwell the main thing is to try and convince as many people as possible that youknowwho really has returned to put them on their guard said bill its proving tricky thoughwhybecause of the ministrys attitude said tonks you saw cornelius fudge after youknowwho came back harry well he hasnt shifted his position at all hes absolutely refusing to believe its happenedbut why said harry desperately whys he being so stupid if dumbledore ah well youve put your finger on the problem said mr weasley with a wry smile dumbledorefudge is frightened of him you see said tonks sadlyfrightened of dumbledore said harry incredulouslyfrightened of what hes up to said mr weasley fudge thinks dumbledores plotting to overthrow him he thinks dumbledore wants to be minister for magicbut dumbledore doesnt want of course he doesnt said mr weasley hes never wanted the ministers job even though a lot of people wanted him to take it when millicent bagnold retired fudge came to power instead buthes never quite forgotten how much popular support dumbledore had even though dumbledore never applied for the jobdeep down fudge knows dumbledores much cleverer than he is a much more powerful wizard and in the early days of his ministry he was forever asking dumbledore for help and advice said lupin but it seems hes become fond of power and much more confident he loves being minister for magic and hes m naged to convince himself that hes the clever one and dumbledores simply stirring up trouble for the sake of ithow can he think that said harry angrily how can he think dumbledore would just make it all up that id make it all upbecause accepting that voldermorts back would mean trouble like the ministry hasnt had to cope with for nearly fourteen yea s said sirius bitterly fudge just cant bring himself to face it its so much more comfortable to convince himself dumbledores lying to destabilise himyou see the problem said lupin while the ministry insists there is nothing to fear from voldemort its hard to convince people hes back especially as they really dont want to believe it in the first place whats more the ministrys leaning heavily on the daily prophet not to report any of what theyre calling dumbledores rumourmongering so most of the wizarding community are completely unaware anythings happened and that makes them easy targets for the death eaters if theyre using the imperius cursebut youre telling people arent you said harry looking around at mr weasley sirius bill mundungus lupin and tonks youre letting people know hes backthey all smiled humourlesslywell as everyone thinks im a mad massmurderer and the ministrys put a ten thousand galleon price on my head i can hardly stroll up the street and start handing out leaflets can i said sirius restlesslyand im not a very popular dinner guest with most of the community said lupin its an occupational hazard of being a werewolftonks and arthur would lose their jobs at the ministry if they started shooting their mouths off said sirius and its very importantfor us to have spies inside the ministry because you can bet voldemort will have themweve managed to convince a couple of people though said mr weasley tonks here for one shes too young to have been in the order of the phoenix last time and having aurors on our side is a huge advantage kingsley shacklebolts been a real asset too hes in charge of the hunt for sirius so hes been feeding the ministry information that sirius is in tibetbut if none of you are putting the news out that voldemorts back harry beganwho said none of us are putting the news out said sirius why dyou think dumbledores in such troublewhat dyou mean harry askedtheyre trying to discredit him said lupin didnt you see the daily prophet last week they reported that hed been voted out of the chairmanship of the international confederation of wizards because hes getting old and losing his grip but its not true he was voted out by ministry wizards after he made a speech announcing voldemorts return theyve demoted him from chief warlock on the wizengamot thats the wizard high court and theyre talking about taking away his order of merlin first class toobut dumbledore says he doesnt care what they do as long as they dont take him off the chocolate frog cards said bill grinningits no laughing matter said mr weasley sharply if he carries on defying the ministry like this he could end up in azkaban and the last thing we want is to have dumbledore locked up while youknowwho knows dumbledores out there and wise to what hes up to hes going to go cautiously if dumbledores out of the way well youknowwho will have a clear fieldbut if voldemorts trying to recruit more death eaters its bound to get out that hes come back isnt it asked harry desperatelyvoldemort doesnt march up to peoples houses and bang on their front doors harry said sirius he tricks jinxes and blackmails them hes wellpractised at operating in secret in any case gathering followers is only one thing hes interested in hes got other plans too plans he can put into operation very quietly indeed and hes concentrating on those for the momentwhats he after apart from followers harry asked swiftly he thought he saw sirius and lupin exchange the most fleeting of looks before sirius answeredstuff he can only get by stealthwhen harry continued to look puzzled sirius said like a weapon something he didnt have last timewhen he was powerful beforeyeslike what kind of weapon said harry something worse than the avada kedavra thats enoughmrs weasley spoke from the shadows beside the door harry hadnt noticed her return from taking ginny upstairs her arms were crossed and she looked furiousi want you in bed now all of you she added looking around at fred george ron and hermioneyou cant boss us fred beganwatch me snarled mrs weasley she was trembling slightly as she looked at sirius youve given harry plenty of information any more and you might just as well induct him into the order straightawaywhy not said harry quickly ill join i want to join i want to fightnoit was not mrs weasley who spoke this time but lupinthe order is comprised only of overage wizards he said wizards who have left school he added as fred and george opened their mouths there are dangers involved of which you can have no idea any of you i think mollys right sirius weve said enoughsirius halfshrugged but did not argue mrs weasley beckoned imperiously to her sons and herrnione one by one they stood up and harry recognising defeat followed suitchapter six the noble and mostancient house of blackmrs weasley followed them upstairs looking grimi want you all to go straight to bed no talking she said as they reached the first landing weve got a busy clay tomorrow i expect ginnys asleep she added to hermione so try not to wake her upasleep yeah right said fred in an undertone after hermione bade them goodnight and they were climbing to the next floor if ginnys not lying awake waiting for hermione to tell her everything they said downstairs then im a flobberworm all right ron harry said mrs weasley on the second landing pointing them into their bedroom off to bed with younight harry and ron said to the twinssleep tight said fred winkingmrs weasley closed the door behind harry with a sharp snap the bedroom looked if anything even danker and gloomier than it had on first sight the blank picture on the wall was now breathing very slowly and deeply as though its invisible occupant was asleep harry put on his pyjamas took off his glasses and climbed into his chilly bed while ron threw owl treats up on top of the wardrobe to pacify hedwig and pigwidgeon who were clattering around and rustling their wings restlesslywe cant let them out to hunt every night ron explained as he pulled on his maroon pyjamas dumbledore doesnt want too many owls swooping around the square thinks itll look suspicious oh yeah i forgot he crossed to the door and bolted itwhatre you doing that forkreacher said ron as he turned off the light first night i was here he came wandering in at three in the morning trust me you dont want to wake up and find him prowling around your room anyway he got into his bed settled down under the co\ers then turned to look at harry in the darkness harry could see his outline by the moonlight filtering in through the grimy window what dyou reckonharry didnt need to ask what ron meantwell they didnt tell us much we couldnt have guessed did they he said thinking of all that had been said downstairs i mean all theyve really said is that the orders trying to stop pec pie joining volthere was a sharp intake of breath from ron demon said harry firmly when are you going to start using his name sirius and lupin doron ignored this last commentyeah youre right he said we already knew nearly everything they told us from using the extendable ears the only new bit was crackouchkeep your voice down ron or mumll be back up hereyou two just apparated on my kneesyeah well its harder in the darkharry saw the blurred outlines of fred and george leaping down from rons bed there was a groan of bedsprings and harrys mattress descended a few inches as george sat down near his feetso got there yet said george eagerlythe weapon sirius mentioned said harrylet slip more like said fred with relish now sitting next to ron we didnt hear about that on the old extendables did wewhat dyou reckon it is said harrycould be anything said fredbut there cant be anything worse than the avada kedavra curse can there said ron whats worse than deathmaybe its something that can kill loads of people at once suggested georgemaybe its some particularly painful way of killing people said ron learfullyhes got the cruciatus curse for causing pain said harry he doesnt need anything more efficient than thatthere was a pause and harry knew that the others like him were wondering what horrors this weapon could perpetrateso who dyou thinks got it now asked georgei hope its our side said ron sounding slightly nervousif it is dumbledores probably keeping it said fredwhere said ron quickly hogwartsbet it is said george thats where he hid the philosophers stonea weapons going to be a lot bigger than the stone though said ronnot necessarily said fredyeah size is no guarantee of power said george look at ginnywhat dyou mean said harryyouve never been on the receiving end of one of her batbogey hexes have youshhh said fred halfrising from the bed listenthey fell silent footsteps were coming up the stairsmum said george and without further ado there was a loud crack and harry felt the weight vanish from the end of his bed a few seconds later they heard the floorboard creak outside their door mrs weasley was plainly listening to check whether or not they were talkinghedwig and pigwidgeon hooted dolefully the floorboard creaked again and they heard her heading upstairs to check on fred and georgeshe doesnt trust us at all you know said ron regretfullyharry was sure he would not be able to fall asleep the evening had been so packed with things to think about that he fully expected to lie awake for hours mulling it all over he wanted to continue talking to ron but mrs weasley was now creaking back downstairs again and once she had gone he distinctly heard others making their way upstairs in fact manylegged creatures were cantering softly up and down outside the bedroom door and hagrid the care of magical creatures teacher was saying beauties arenti they eh harry well be studyin weapons this term and harry saw hat the creatures had cannons for heads and were wheeling to ace him he ducked the next thing he knew he was curled into a warm ball under his bedclothes and georges loud voice was filling the roommum says get up your breakfast is in the kitchen and then she needs you in the drawing room there are loads more doxys than she thought and shes found a nest of dead puffskeins under the sofahalf an hour later harry and ron who had dressed and breakfasted quickly entered the drawing room a long highceilinged room on the first floor with olive green walls covered in dirty apestries the carpet exhaled little clouds of dust every time someone put their foot on it and the long moss green velvet curtains were buzzing as though swarming with invisible bees it was aroand these that mrs weasley hermione ginny fred and george were grouped all looking rather peculiar as they had each tied a cloth over their nose and mouth each of them was also holding a large bottle of black liquid with a nozzle at the endcover your faces and take a spray mrs weasley said to harry and ron the moment she saw them pointing to two more boitles of black liquid standing on a spindlelegged table its doxycide ive never seen an infestation this bad what that houseelfs veen doing for the last ten years hermiones face was half concealed by a tea towel but harry distinctly saw her throw a reproachful look at mrs weasleykreachers really old he probably couldnt manage youd be surprised what kreacher can manage when he wnnts to hermione said sirius who had just entered the room carrying a bloodstained bag of what appeared to be dead rats ive just been feeding buckbeak he added in reply to harrys enquiring look i keep him upstairs in my mothers bedroom anyway this writing desk he dropped the bag of rats into an armchair then bent over to examine the locked cabinet which harry now noticed for the first time was shaking slightlywell molly im pretty sure this is a boggart said sirius peering through the keyhole but perhaps we ought to let madeye have a shifty at it before we let it out knowing my mother it could be something much worseright you are sirius said mrs weasleythey were both speaking in carefully light polite voices that told harry quite plainly that neither had forgotten their disagreement of the night beforea loud clanging bell sounded from downstairs followed at once by the cacophony of screams and wails that had been triggered the previous night by tonks knocking over the umbrella standi keep telling them not to ring the doorbell said sirius exasperatedly hurrying out of the room they heard him thundering clown the stairs as mrs blacks screeches echoed up through the house once morestains of dishonour filthy halfbreeds blood traitors children of flith close the door please harry said mrs weasleyharry took as much time as he dared to close the drawingroom door he wanted to listen to what was going on downstairs sirius had obviously managed to shut the curtains over his mothers portrait because she had stopped screaming he heard sirius walking down the hall then the clattering of the chain on the front door and then a deep voice he recognised as kingsley shacklebolts saying hestias just relieved me so shes got moodys cloak now thought id leave a report for dumbledore feeling mrs weasleys eyes on the back of his head harry regretfully closed the drawingroom door and rejoined the doxy partymrs weasley was bending over to check the page on doxys in gilderoy lockharts guide to household pests which was lying open on the sofaright you lot you need to be careful because doxys bite and their teeth are poisonous ive got a bottle of antidote here but id rather nobody needed itshe straightened up positioned herself squarely in front of the curtains and beckoned them all forwardwhen i say the word start spraying immediately she said theyll come flying out at us i expect but it says on the sprays one good squirt will paralyse them when theyre immobilized just throw them in this bucketshe stepped carefully out of their line of fire and raised her own sprayall right squirtharry had been spraying only a few seconds when a fullygrown doxy came soaring out of a fold in the material shiny beetlelike wings whirring tiny needlesharp teeth bared its fairylike body covered with thick black hair and its four tiny fists clenched with fury harry caught it full in the face with a blast of doxycide it froze in midair and fell with a surprisingly loud thunk on to the worn carpet below harry picked it up and threw it in the bucketfred what are you doing said mrs weasley sharply spray that at once and throw it awayharry looked round fred was holding a struggling doxy between his forefinger and thumbrighto fred said brightly spraying the doxy quickly in the face so that it fainted but the moment mrs weasleys back was turned he pocketed it with a winkwe want to experiment with doxy venom for our skiving snackboxes george told harry under his breathdeftly spraying two doxys at once as they soared straight for his nose harry moved closer to george and muttered out of the corner of his mouth what are skiving snackboxesrange of sweets to make you ill george whispered keeping a wary eye on mrs weasleys back not seriously ill mind just ill enough to get you out of a class when you feel like it fred and i have been developing them this summer theyre doubleended colourcoded chews if you eat the orange half of the puking pastilles you throw up moment youve been rushed out of the lesson for the hospital wing you swallow the purple half which restores you to full fitness enabling you to pursue the leisure activity of your own choice during an hour that would otherwise have been devoted to unprofitable boredom thats what were putting in the adverts anyway whispered fred who had edged over out of mrs weasleys line of vision and was now sweeping a few stray doxys from the floor and adding them to his pocket but they still need a bit of work at the moment our testers are having a bit of trouble stopping themselves puking long enough to swallow the purple endtestersus said fred we take it in turns george did the fainting fancies we both tried the nosebleed nougat mum thought wed been duelling said georgejoke shop still on then harry muttered pretending to be adjusting the nozzle on his spraywell we havent had a chance to get premises yet said fred dropping his voice even lower as mrs weasley mopped her brow with her scarf before returning to the attack so were running it as a mailorder service at the moment we put advertisements in the daily prophet last weekall thanks to you mate said george but dont worry mum hasnt got a clue she wont read the daily prophet any more cause of it telling lies about you and dumbledoreharry grinned he had forced the weasley twins to take the thousand galleons prize money he had won in the triwizard tournament to help them realise their ambition to open a joke shop but he was still glad to know that his part in furthering their plans was unknown to mrs weasley she did not think running a joke shop was a suitable career for two of her sonsthe dedoxying of the curtains took most of the morning it was past midday when mrs weasley finally removed her protective scarf sank into a sagging armchair and sprang up again with a cry of disgust having sat on the bag of dead rats the curtains were no longer buzzing they hung limp and damp from the intensive spraying at the foot of them unconscious doxys lay crammed in the bucket beside a bowl of their black eggs at which crookshanks was now sniffing and fred and george were shooting covetous looksi think well tackle hose after lunch mrs weasley pointed at the dusty glassfronted cabinets standing on either side of the mantelpiece they were crammed with an odd assortment of objects a selection of rusty daggers claws a coiled snakeskin a number of tarnished silver boxes inscribed with languages harry could lot understand and least pleasant of all an ornate crystal bottle with a large opal set into the stopper full of what harry was quite sure was bloodthe clanging doorbell rang again everyone looked at mrs weasleystay here she said firmly snatching up the bag of rats as mrs blacks screeches started up again from down below ill bring up some sandwichesshe left the room closing the door carefully behind her at once everyone dashed over to the window to look down on the doorstep they could see the top of an unkempt gingery head and a suck of precariously balanced cauldronsmundungus said hermione whats he brought all those cauldrons forprobably looking for a safe place to keep them said harry isnt that what he was doing the night he was supposed to be tailing me picking up dodgy cauldronsyeah youre right said fred as the front door opened mundungus heaved his cauldrons through it and disappeared from view blimey mum wont like that he and george crossed to the door and stood beside it listening closely mrs blacks screaming had stoppedmundungus is talking to sirius and kingsley fred muttered frowning with concentration cant hear properly dyou reckon we can risk the extendable earsmight be worth it said george i could sneak upstairs and get a pair but at that precise moment there was an explosion of sound from downstairs that rendered extendable ears quite unnecessary all of them could hear exactly what mrs weasley was shouting at the top of her voicewe are not running a hideout for stolen goodsi love hearing mum shouting at someone else said fred with a satisfied smile on his face as he opened the door an inch or so to allow mrs weasleys voice to permeate the room better it makes such a nice changecompletely irresponsible as if we havent got enough to worry about without you dragging stolen cauldrons into the house the idiots are letting her get into her stride said george shaking his head youve got to head her off early otherwise she builds up a head of steam and goes on for hours and shes been dying to have a go at mundungus ever since he sneaked off when he was supposed to be following you harry and there goes siriuss mum againmrs weasleys voice was lost amid fresh shrieks and screams from the portraits in the hallgeorge made to shut the door to drown the noise but before he could do so a houseelf edged into the roomexcept for the filthy rag tied like a loincloth around its middle it was completely naked it looked very old its skin seemed to be several times too big for it and though it was bald like all houseelves there was a quantity of white hair growing out of its large batlike ears its eyes were a bloodshot and watery grey and its fleshy nose was large and rather snoutlikethe elf took absolutely no notice of harry and the rest acting as though it could not see them it shuffled hunchbacked slowly and doggedly towards the far end of the room all the while muttering under its breath in a hoarse deep voice like a bullfrogssmells like a drain and a criminal to boot but shes no better nasty old blood traitor with her brats messing up my mistresss house oh my poor mistress if she knew if she knew the scum theyve let into her house what would she say to old kreacher oh the shame of it mudbloods and werewolves and traitors and thieves poor old kreacher what can he do hello kreacher said fred very loudly closing the door with a snapthe houseelf froze in his tracks stopped muttering and gave a very pronounced and very unconvincing start of surprisekreacher did not see young master he said turning around and bowing to fred still lacing the carpet he added perfectly audibly nasty little brat of a blood traitor it issorry said george didnt catch that last bitkreacher said nothing said the elf with a second box to george adding in a clear undertone and there its twin unnataral little beasts they areharry didnt know whether to laugh or not the elf straightened up eyeing them all malevolently and apparently convinced that they could not hear him as he continued to mutterand theres the mudblood standing there bold as brass oh if my mistress knew oh how shed cry and theres a new boy kreacher doesnt know his name what is he doing here kreacher doesnt know this is harry kreacher said hermione tentatively harry potterkreachers pale eyes widened and he muttered faster and more furiously than everthe mudblood is talking to kreacher as though she is my friend if kreachers mistress saw him in such company oh what would she say dont call her a mudblood said ron and ginny together very angrilyit doesnt matter hermione whispered hes not in his tight mind he doesnt know what hes dont kid yourself hermione he knows exactly what hes saying said fred eyeing kreacher with great dislikekreacher was still muttering his eyes on harryis it true is it harry potter kreacher can see the scar it must be true thats the boy who stopped the dark lord kreacher wonders how he did it dont we all kreacher said fredwhat do you want anyway george askedkreachers huge eyes darted towards georgekreacher is cleaning he said evasivelya likely story said a voice behind harrysirius had come back he was glowering at the elf from the doorway the noise in the hall had abated perhaps mrs weasley and mundungus had moved their argument down into the kitchenat the sight of sirius kreacher flung himself into a ridiculously low bow that flattened his snoutlike nose on the floorstand up straight said sirius impatiently now what are you up tokreacher is cleaning the elf repeated kreacher lives to serve lie noble house of black and its getting blacker every day its filthy said siriusmaster always liked his little joke said kreacher bowing again and continuing in an undertone master was a nasty ungrateful swine who broke his mothers heart my mother didnt have a heart kreacher snapped sirius she kept herself alive out of pure spitekreacher bowed again as he spokewhatever master says he muttered furiously master is not fit to wipe slime from his mothers boots oh my poor mistress what would she say if she saw kreacher serving him how she hated him what a disappointment he was i asked you what you were up to said sirius coldly every time you show up pretending to be cleaning you sneak something off to your room so we cant throw it outkreacher would never move anything from its proper place in masters house said the elf then muttered very fast mistress would never forgive kreacher if the tapestry was thrown out seven centuries its been in the family kreacher must save it kreacher will not let master and the blood traitors and the brats destroy it i thought it might be that said sirius casting a disdainful look at the opposite wall shell have put another permanent sticking charm on the back of it i dont doubt but if i can get rid of it i certainly will now go away kreacherit seemed that kreacher did not dare disobey a direct order nevertheless the look he gave sirius as he shuffled out past him was full of deepest loathing and he muttered all the way out of the roomcomes back from azkaban ordering kreacher around oh my poor mistress what would she say if she saw the house now scum living in it her treasures thrown out she swore he was no son of hers and hes back they say hes a murderer too keep muttering and i will be a murderer said sirius irritably as he slammed the door shut on the elfsirius hes not right in the head hermione pleaded i dont think he realises we can hear himhes been alone too long said sirius taking mad orders from my mothers portrait and talking to himself but he was always a foul little if you could just set him free said hermione hopefully maybe we cant set him free he knows too much about the order said sirius curtly and anyway the shock would kill him you suggest to him that he leaves this house see how he takes itsirius walked across the room to where the tapestry kreacher had been trying to protect hung the length of the wall harry and the others followedthe tapestry looked immensely old it was laded and looked as though doxys had gnawed it in places nevertheless the golden thread with which it was embroidered still glinted brightly enough to show them a sprawling family tree dating back as far as harry could tell to the middle ages large words at the very top of the tapestry readthe noble and most ancient house of blacktoujours puryoure not on here said harry after scanning the bottom of the tree closelyi used to be there said sirius pointing at a small round charred hole in the tapestry rather like a cigarette burn my sweet old mother blasted me off after i ran away from home kreachers quite fond of muttering the story under his breathyou ran away from homewhen i was about sixteen said sirius id had enoughwhere did you go asked harry staring at himyour dads place said sirius your grandparents were really good about it they sort of adopted me as a second son yeah i camped out at your dads in the school holidays and when i was seventeen i got a place of my own my uncle alphard had left me a decent bit of gold hes been wiped off here too thats probably why anyway after that i looked after myself i was always welcome at mr and mrs potters for sunday lunch thoughbut why did you leave sirius smiled bitterly and ran his fingers through his long unkempt hair because i hated the whole lot of them my parents with their pureblood mania convinced that to be a black made you practically royal my idiot brother soft enough to believe them thats himsirius jabbed a finger at the very bottom of the tree at the name regulus black a date of death some fifteen years previously followed the date of birthhe was younger than me said sirius and a much better son as i was constantly remindedbut he died said harryyeah said sirius stupid idiot he joined the death eatersyoure kiddingcome on harry havent you seen enough of this house to tell what kind of wizards my family were said sirius testilywere were your parents death eaters as wellno no but believe me they thought voldemort had the right idea they were all for the purification of the wizarding race getting rid of muggleborns and having purebloods in charge they werent alone either there were quite a few people before voldemort showed his true colours who thought he had the right idea about things they got cold feet when they saw what he was prepared to do to get power though but i bet my parents thought regulus was a right little hero for joining up at firstwas he killed by an auror harry asked tentativelyoh no said sirius no he was murdered by voldemort or on voldemorts orders more likely i doubt regulus was ever important enough to be killed by voldemort in person from what i found out after he died he got in so far then panicked about what he was being asked to do and tried to back out well you dont just hand in your resignation to voldemort its a lifetime of service or deathlunch said mrs weasleys voiceshe was holding her wand high in front of her balancing a huge tray loaded with sandwiches and cake on its tip she was very red in the face and still looked angry the others moved over to her eager for some food but harry remained with sirius who had bent closer to the tapestryi havent looked at this for years theres phineas nigellu my greatgreatgrandfather see least popular headmaster hogwarts ever had and araminta meliflua cousin of my mothers tried to force through a ministry bill to make mugglehunting legal and dear aunt elladora she started the family tradition of beheading houseelves when they got too old to carry tea trays of course any time the family produced someone halfway decent they were disowned i see tonks isnt on here maybe thats why kreacher wont take orders from her hes supposed to do whatever anyone in the family asks him you and tonks are related harry asked surprisedoh yeah her mother andromeda was my favourite col sin said sirius examining the tapestry closely no andromedas not on here either look he pointed to another small round burn mark between two names bellatrix and narcissaandromedas sisters are still here because they made lovely respectable pureblood marriages but andromeda married a muggleborn ted tonks so sirius mimed blasting the tapestry with a wand and laughed sourly harry however did not laugh he was too busy staring at the names to the right of andromedas burn mark a double line of gold embroidery linked narcissa black with lucius malfoy and a single vertical gold line from their names led to the name dracoyoure related to the malfoysthe pureblood families are all interrelated said sirius if youre only going to let your sons and daughters marry purebloods our choice is very limited there are hardly any of us left molly and i are cousins by marriage and arthurs something like my second cousin once removed but theres no point looking for then on here if ever a family was a bunch of blood traitors its the weaseysbut harry was now looking at the name to the left of andromedas burn bellatrix black which was connected by a double line to rodolphus lestrangelestrange harry said aloud the name had stirred something in his memory he knew it from somewhere but for a moment he couldnt think where though it gave him an odd creeping sensation in the pit of his stomachtheyre in azkaban said sirius shortlyharry looked at him curiouslybellatrix and her husband rodolphus came in with barty crouch junior said sirius in the same brusque voice rodolphuss brother rabastan was with them toothen harry remembered he had seen bellatrix lestrange inside dumbledores pensieve the strange device in which thoughts and memories could be stored a tall dark woman with heavylidded eyes who had stood at her trial and proclaimed her continuing allegiance to lord voldemort her pride that she had tried to find him after his downfall and her conviction that she would one day be rewarded for her loyaltyyou never said she was your does it matter if shes my cousin snapped sirius as far as im concerned theyre not my family shes certainly not my family i havent seen her since i was your age unless you count a glimpse of her coming into azkaban dyou think im proud of having a relative like hersorry said harry quickly i didnt mean i was just surprised thats all it doesnt matter dont apologise sirius mumbled he turned away from the tapestry his hands deep in his pockets i dont like being back here he said staring across the drawing room i never thought id be stuck in this house againharry understood completely he knew how he would feel when he was grown up and thought he was free of the place for ever to return and live at number four privet driveits ideal for headquarters of course sirius said my father put every security measure known to wizardkind on it when he lived here its unplottable so muggles could never come and call as if they d ever have wanted to and now dumbledores added his protection youd be hard put to find a safer house anywhere dumbledore is secret keeper for the order you know nobody can find headquarters unless he tells them personally where it is that note moody showed you last night that was from dumbledore sirius gave a short barklike laugh if my parents could see the use their house was being put to now well my mothers portrait should give you some ideahe scowled for a moment then sighedi wouldnt mind if i could just get out occasionally and do something useful ive asked dumbledore whether i can escort you to your hearing as snuffles obviously so i can give you a bit of moral support what dyou thinkharry felt as though his stomach had sunk through the dusty carpet he had not thought about the hearing once since dinner the previous evening in the excitement of being back with the people he liked best and hearing everything that was going on it had completely flown his mind at siriuss words however the crushing sense of dread returned to him he stared at hermione and the weasleys all tucking into their sandwiches and thought how he would feel if they went back to hogwarts without himdont worry sirius said harry looked up and realised that sirius had been watching him im sure theyll clear you theres definitely something in the international statute of secrecy about being allowed to use magic to save your own lifebut if they do expel me said harry quietly can i come back here and live with yousirius smiled sadlywell seeid feel a lot better about the hearing if i knew i didnt have to go back to the dursleys harry pressed himthey must be bad if you prefer this place said sirius gloomilyhurry up you two or there wont be any food left mrs weasley calledsirius heaved another great sigh cast a dark look at the tapestry then he and harry went to join the othersharry tried his best not to think about the hearing while he emptied the glassfronted cabinets that afternoon fortunately for him it was a job that required a lot of concentration as many of the objects in there seemed very reluctant to leave their dusty shelves sirius sustained a bad bite from a silver snuffbox within seconds his bitten hand had developed an unpleasant crusty covering like a tough brown gloveits ok he said examining the hand with interest before tapping it lightly with his wand and restoring its skin to normal must be wartcap powder in therehe threw the box aside into the sack where they were depositing the debris from the cabinets harry saw george wrap his own hand carefully in a cloth moments later and sneak the box into his already doxyfilled pocketthey found an unpleasantlooking silver instrument something like a manylegged pair of tweezers which scuttled up harrys arm like a spider when he picked it up and attempted to puncture his skin sirius seized it and smashed it with a heavy book entitled natures nobility a wizarding genealogy there was a musical box that emitted a faintly sinister tinkling tune when wound and they all found themselves becoming curiously weak and sleepy until ginny had the sense to slam the lid shut a heavy locket that none of them could open a number of ancient seals and in a dusty box an order of merlin first class that had been awarded to siriuss grandfather for services to the ministryit means he gave them a load of gold said sirius contemptuously throwing the medal into the rubbish sackseveral times kreacher sidled into the room and attempted to smuggle things away under his loincloth muttering horrible curses every time they caught him at it when sirius wrested a large go den ring bearing the black crest from his grip kreacher actually burst into furious tears and left the room sobbing under his breath and calling sirius names harry had never heard beforeit was my fathers said sirius throwing the ring into the sack kreacher wasnt quite as devoted to him as to my mother but i still caught him snogging a pair of my fathers old trousers last weekmrs weasley kept them all working very hard over the next few days the drawing room took three days to decontaminate finally the only undesirable things left in it were the tapestry of the black family tree which resisted all their attempts to remove it from the wall and the rattling writing desk moody had not dropped by headquarters yet so they could not be sure what was inside itthey moved from the drawing room to a dining room on the ground floor where they found spiders as large as saucers lurking in the dresser ron left the room hurriedly to make a cup of tea and did not return for an hour and a half the china which bore the black crest and motto was all thrown unceremoniously into a sack by sirius and the same fate met a set of old photographs in tarnished silver frames all of whose occupants squealed shrilly as the glass covering them smashedsnape might refer to their work as cleaning but in harrys opinion they were really waging war on the house which was putting up a very good fight aided and abetted by kreacher the houseelf kept appearing wherever they were congregated his muttering becoming more and more offensive as he attempted to remove anything he could from the rubbish sacks sirius went as far as to threaten him with clothes but kreacher fixed him with a watery stare and said master must do as master wishes before turning away and muttering very loudly but master will not turn kreacher away no because kreacher knows what they are up to oh yes he is plotting against the dark lord yes with these mudblood and traitors and scum at which sirius ignoring hermiones protests seized kreacher by the back of his loincloth and threw him bodily from the roomthe doorbell rang several times a day which was the cue for siriuss mother to start shrieking again and for harry and the others to attempt to eavesdrop on the visitor though they gleaned very little from the brief glimpses and snatches of conversation they were able to sneak before mrs weasley recalled them to their tasks snape flitted in and out of the house several times more though to harrys relief they never came face to face harry also caught sight of his transfiguration teacher professor mcgonagall looking very odd in a muggle dress and coat and she also seemed too busy to linger sometimes however the visitors stayed to help tonks joined them for a memorable afternoon in which they found a murderous old ghoul lurking in an upstairs toilet and lupin who was staying in the house with sirius but who left it for long periods to do mysterious work for the order helped them repair a grandfather clock that had developed the unpleasant habit of shooting heavy bolts at passersby mundungus redeemed himself slightly in mrs weasleys eyes by rescuing ron from an ancient set of purple robes that had tried to strangle him when he removed them from their wardrobedespite the fact that he was still sleeping badly still having dreams about corridors and locked doors that made his scar prickle harry was managing to have fun for the first time all summer as long as he was busy he was happy when the action abated however whenever he dropped his guard or lay exhausted in bed watching blurred shadows move across the ceiling the thought of the looming ministry hearing returned to him fear jabbed at his insides like needles as he wondered what was going to happen to him if he was expelled the idea was so terrible that he did not dare voice it aloud not even to ron and hermione who though he often saw them whispering together and casting anxious looks in his direction followed his lead in not mentioning it sometimes he could not prevent his imagination showing him a faceless ministry official who was snapping his wand in two and ordering him back to the dursleys but he would not go he was determined on that he would come back here to grimmauld place and live with siriushe felt as though a brick had dropped into his stomach when mrs weasley turned to him during dinner on wednesday evening and said quietly ive ironed your best clothes for tomorrow morning harry and i want you to wash your hair tonight too a good first impression can work wondersron hermione fred george and ginny all stopped talking and looked over at him harry nodded and tried to keep eating his chop but his mouth had become so dry he could not chewhow am i getting there he asked mrs weasley trying to sound unconcernedarthurs taking you to work with him said mrs weasley gentlymr weasley smiled encouragingly at harry across the tableyou can wait in my office until its time for the hearing he saidharry looked over at sirius but before he could ask the question mrs weasley had answered itprofessor dumbledore doesnt think its a good idea for sirius to go with you and i must say i think hes quite right said sirius through clenched teethmrs weasley pursed her lipswhen did dumbledore tell you that harry said staring at siriushe came last night when you were in bed said mr weasleysirius stabbed moodily at a potato with his fork harry lowered his own eyes to his plate the thought that dumbledore had been in the house on the eve of his hearing and not asked to see him made him feel if it were possible even worsechapter seven the ministry of magicharry awoke at half past five the next morning as abruptly and completely as if somebody had yelled in his ear for a few moments he lay immobile as the prospect of the disciplinary hearing filled every tiny particle of his brain then unable to bear it he leapt out of bed and put on his glasses mrs weasley had laid out his freshly laundered jeans and tshirt at the foot of his bed harry scrambled into them the blank picture on the wall sniggeredron was lying sprawled on his back with his mouth wide open fast asleep he did not stir as harry crossed the room stepped out on to the landing and closed the door softly behind him trying net to think of the next time he would see ron when they might no longer be fellow students at hogwarts harry walked quietly down the stairs past the heads of kreachers ancestors and down into the kitchenhe had expected it to be empty but when he reached the door he heard the soft rumble of voices on the other side he pushed it open and saw mr and mrs weasley sirius lupin and tonks sitting there almost as though they were waiting for him all were fully dressed except mrs weasley who was wearing a quilted purple dressing gown she leapt to her feet the moment harry enteredbreakfast she said as she pulled out her wand and hurried over to the firem m morning harry yawned tonks her hair was blonde and curly this morning sleep all rightyeah said harryive b b been up all night she said with another shuddering yawn come and sit down she drew out a chair knocking over the one beside it ir the processwhat do you want harry mrs weasley called porridge muffins kippers bacon and eggs toastjust just toast thanks said harrylupin glanced at harry then said to tonks what were you saying about scrimgeouroh yeah well we need to be a bit more careful hes been asking kingsley and me funny questions harry felt vaguely grateful that he was not required to join in the conversation his insides were squirming mrs weasley placed a couple of pieces of toast and marmalade in front of him he tried to eat but it was like chewing carpet mrs weasley sat down on his other side and started fussing with his tshirt tucking in the label and smoothing out the creases across his shoulders he wished she wouldntand ill have to tell dumbledore i cant do night duty tomorrow im just t t too tired tonks finished yawning hugely againill cover for you said mr weasley im ok ive got a report to finish anywaymr weasley was not wearing wizards robes but a pair of pinstriped trousers and an old bomber jacket he turned from tonks to harryhow are you feelingharry shruggeditll all be over soon mr weasley said bracingly in a few hours time youll be clearedharry said nothingthe hearings on my floor in amelia boness office shes head of the department of magical law enforcement and the one wholl be questioning youamelia bones is ok harry said tonks earnestly shes fair shell hear you outharry nodded still unable to think of anything to saydont lose your temper said sirius abruptly be polite and stick to the factsharry nodded againthe laws on your side said lupin quietly even underage wizards are allowed to use magic in lifethreatening situationssomething very cold trickled down the back of harrys neck for a moment he thought someone was putting a disillusionment charm on him then he realised that mrs weasley was attacking his hair with a wet comb she pressed hard on the top of his headdoesnt it ever lie flat she said desperatelyharry shook his headmr weasley checked his watch and looked up at harry i think well go now he said were a bit early but i think you be better off at the ministry than hanging around hereok said harry automatically dropping his toast and getting to his feetyoull be all right harry said tonks palling him on the armgood luck said lupin im sure it will be fineand if its not said sirius grimly ill see to amelia bones for you harry smiled weakly mrs weasley hugged himweve all got our fingers crossed she saidright said harry well see you later thenhe followed mr weasley upstairs and along the hall he could hear siriuss mother grunting in her sleep behind her curtains mr weasley unbolted the door and they stepped out into the cold grey dawnyou dont normally walk to work do you harry asked him as they set off briskly around the squareno i usually apparate said mr weasley but obviously you cant and i think its best we arrive in a thoroughly nonmagical fashion makes a better impression given what youre being disciplined for mr weasley kept his hand inside his jacket as they walked harry knew it was clenched around his wand the rundown streets were al most deserted but when they arrived at the miserable little underground station they found it already lull of earlymorning commuters as ever when he found himself in close proximity to muggles going about their daily business mr weasley was hard put to contain his enthusiasmsimply fabulous he whispered indicating the automatic ticket machines wonderfully ingenioustheyre out of order said harry pointing at the signyes but even so said mr weasley beaming at them fondlythey bought their tickets instead from a sleepylooking guard harry handled the transaction as mr weasley was not very good with muggle money and five minutes later they were boarding an underground train that rattled them off towards the centre of london mr weasley kept anxiously checking and rechecking the underground map above the windowsfour more stops harry three stops led now two stops to go harry they got off at a station in the very heart of london and were swept from the train in a tide of besuited men and women carrying briefcases up the escalator they went through the ticket barrier mr weasley delighted with the way the stile swallowed his ticket and emerged on to a broad street lined with imposinglooking buildings and already full of trafficwhere are we said mr weasley blankly and for one heartstopping moment harry thought they had got off at the wrong station despite mr weasleys continual references to the map but a second later he said ah yes this way harry and led him down a side roadsorry he said but i never come by train and it all looks rather different from a muggle perspective as a matter of fact ive never even used the visitors entrance beforethe further they walked the smaller and less imposing the buildings became until finally they reached a street that contained several rather shabbylooking offices a pub and an overflowing skip harry had expected a rather more impressive location for the ministry of magichere we are said mr weasley brightly pointing at an old red telephone box which was missing several panes of glass and stood before a heavily graffitied wall after you harryhe opened the telephonebox doorharry stepped inside wondering what on earth this was about mr weasley folded himself in beside harry and closed the door it was a tight fit harry was jammed against the telephone apparatus which was hanging crookedly from the wall as though a vandal had tried to rip it off mr weasley reached past harry for the receivermr weasley i think this might be out of order too harry saidno no im sure its fine said mr weasley holding the receiver above his head and peering at the dial lets see six he dialled the number two four and another four and another two as the dial whirred smoothly back into place a cool female voice sounded inside the telephone box not from the receiver in mr weasleys hand but as loudly and plainly as though an invisible woman were standing right beside themwelcome to the ministry of magic please state your name and businesser said mr weasley clearly uncertain whether or not he should talk into the receiver he compromised by holding the mouthpiece to his ear arthur weasley misuse of muggle artefacts office here to escort harry potter who has been asked to attend a disciplinary hearing thank you said the cool female voice visitor please take the badge and attach it to the front of your robesthere was a click and a rattle and harry saw something slide out of the metal chute where returned coins usually appeared he picked it up it was a square silver badge with harry potter disciplinary hearing on it he pinned it to the front of his tshirt as the female voice spoke againvisitor to the ministry you are required to submit to a search and present your wand for registration at the security desk which is located at the far end of the atrium the floor of the telephone box shuddered they were sinking slowly into the ground harry watched apprehensively as the pavement seemed to rise up past the glass windows of the telephone box until darkness closed over their heads then he could see nothing at all he could hear only a dull grinding noise as the telephone box made its way down through the earth after about a minute though it felt much longer to harry a chink of golden light illuminated his feet and widening rose up his body until it hit him in the face and he had to blink to stop his eyes wateringthe ministry of magic wishes you a pleasant day said the womans voicethe door of the telephone box sprang open and mr weasley stepped out of it followed by harry whose mouth had fallen openthey were standing at one end of a very long and splendid hall with a highly polished dark wood floor the peacock blue ceiling was inlaid with gleaming golden symbols that kept moving and changing like some enormous heavenly noticeboard the walls on each side were panelled in shiny dark wood and had many gilded fireplaces set into them every few seconds a witch or wizard would emerge from one of the lefthand fireplaces with a soft whoosh on the righthand side short queues were forming before each fireplace waiting to departhalfway down the hall was a fountain a group of golden statues larger than lifesize stood in the middle of a circular pool tallest of them all was a noblelooking wizard with his wand pointing straight up in the air grouped around him were a beautiful witch a centaur a goblin and a houseelf the last three were all locking adoringly up at the witch and wizard glittering jets of water were flying from the ends of their wands the point of the centaurs a tow the tip of the goblins hat and each of the houseelfs ears so that the tinkling hiss of falling water was added to the pops and cracks of the apparators and the clatter of footsteps as hundreds of witches and wizards most of whom were wearing glum earlymorning looks strode towards a set of golden gates at the far end of the hallthis way said mr weasleythey joined the throng wending their way between the ministry workers some of whom were carrying tottering piles of parchment others battered briefcases still others were reading the daily prophet while they walked as they passed the fountain harry saw silver sickles and bronze knuts glinting up at him from the bottom of the pool a small smudged sign beside it readall proceeds from the fountain of magical brethren will be given to st mungos hospital for magical maladies and injuriesif im not expelled from hogwarts ill put in ten galleons harry found himself thinking desperatelyover here harry said mr weasley and they stepped out of the stream of ministry employees heading for the golden gates seated at a desk to the left beneath a sign saying security a badlyshaven wizard in peacock blue robes looked up as they approached and put down his daily prophetim escorting a visitor said mr weasley gesturing towards harrystep over here said the wizard in a bored voiceharry walked closer to him and the wizard held up a long golden rod thin and flexible as a car aerial and passed it up and down harrys front and backwand grunted the security wizard at harry putting down the golden instrument and holding out his handharry produced his wand the wizard dropped it on to a strange brass instrument which looked something like a set of scales with only one dish it began to vibrate a narrow strip of parchment came speeding out of a slit in the base the wizard tore this off and read the writing on iteleven inches phoenixfeather core been in use four years that correctyes said harry nervouslyi keep this said the wizard impaling the slip of parchment on a small brass spike you get this back he added thrusting the wand at harrythank youhang on said the wizard slowlyhis eyes had darted from the silver visitors badge on harrys chest to his foreheadthank you eric said mr weasley firmly and grasping harry by the shoulder he steered him away from the desk and back into the stream of wizards and witches walking through the golden gatesjostled slightly by the crowd harry followed mr weasley through the gates into the smaller hall beyond where at least twenty lifts stood behind wrought golden grilles harry and mr weasley joined the crowd around one of them nearby stood a big bearded wizard holding a large cardboard box which was emitting rasping noisesall right arthur said the wizard nodding at mr weasleywhatve you got there bob asked mr weasley looking at the boxwere not sure said the wizard seriously we thought it was a bogstandard chicken until it started breathing fire looks like a serious breach of the ban on experimental breeding to mewith a great jangling and clattering a lift descended in front of them the golden grille slid back and harry and mr weasley stepped into the lift with the rest of the crowd and harry found himself jammed against the back wall several witches and wizards were looking at him curiously he stared at his feet to avoid catching anyones eye flattening his fringe as he did so the grilles slid shut with a crash and the lift ascended slowly chains rattling while the same cool female voice harry had heard in the telephone box rang out againlevel seven department of magical games and sports incorporating the british and irish quidditch league headquarters official gobstones club and ludicrous patents officethe lift doors opened harry glimpsed an untidylooking corridor with various posters of quidditch teams tacked lopsidedly on the walls one of the wizards in the lift who was

department of magical transportation incorporating the floo network authority broom regulatory control portkey office and apparation test centreonce again the lift doors opened and four or five witches and wizards got out at the same time several paper aeroplanes swooped into the lift harry stared up at them as they flapped idly around above his head they were a pale violet colour and he could see ministry of magic stamped along the edge of their wingsjust interdepartmental memos mr weasley muttered to him we used to use owls but the mess was unbelievable droppings a i over the

windows magical maintenance decide what weather well get every day we had two months of hurricanes last time they were angling for a pay rise just round here harrythey turned a corner walked through a pair of heavy oak doors and emerged in a cluttered open area divided into cubicles which was buzzing with talk and laughter memos were zooming in and out of cubicles like miniature rockets a lopsided sign on the nearest cubicle read auror headquartersharry looked surreptitiously through the doorways as they passed the aurors had covered their cubicle walls with everything from pictures of wanted wizards and photographs of their families to posters of their favourite quidditch teams and articles from the daily prophet a scarletrobed man with a ponytail longer than bills was sitting with his boots up on his desk dictating a report to his quill a little further along a witch with a patch over one eye was talking over the top of her cubicle wall to kingsley shackleboltmorning weasley said kingsley carelessly as they drew nearer ive been wanting a word with you have you got a secondyes if it really is a second said mr weasley im in rather a hurrythey were talking as though they hardly knew each other and when harry opened his mouth to say hello to kingsley mr we ashy stood on his foot they followed kingsley along the row and into the very last cubicleharry received a slight shock blinking down at him from every direction was siriuss face newspaper cuttings and old photographs even the one of sirius being best man at the potters wedding papered the walls the only siriusfree space was a map of the world in which little red pins were glowing like jewelshere said kingsley brusquely to mr weasley shoving a sheaf of parchment into his hand i need as much information as possible on flying muggle vehicles sighted in the last twelve months weve received information that black might still be using his old motorcyclekingsley tipped harry an enormous wink and added in a whisper give him the magazine he might find it interesting then he said in normal tones and dont take too long weasley the delay on that firelegs report held our investigation up for a monthif you had read my report you would know that the term is firearms said mr weasley coolly and im afraid youll have to wait for information on motorcycles were extremely busy at the moment he dropped his voice and said if you can get away before seven mollys making meatballshe beckoned to harry and led him out of kingsleys cubicle through a second set of oak doors into another passage turned left marched along another corridor turned right into a dimly lit and distinctly shabby corridor and finally reached a dead end where a door on the left stood ajar revealing a broom cupboard and a door on the right bore a tarnished brass plaque reading misuse of muggle artefactsmr weasleys dingy office seemed to be slightly smaller than the broom cupboard two desks had been crammed inside it and there was barely space to move around them because of all the overflowing filing cabinets lining the walls on top of which were tottering piles of files the little wall space available bore witness to mr weasleys obsessions several posters of cars including one of a dismantled engine two illustrations of postboxes he seemed to have cut out of muggle childrens books and a diagram showing how to wire a plugsitting on top of mr weasleys overflowing intray was an old toaster that was hiccoughing in a disconsolate way and a pair of empty leather gloves that were twiddling their thumbs a photograph of the weasley family stood beside the intray harry noticed that percy appeared to have walked out of itwe havent got a window said mr weasley apologetically taking off his bomber jacket and placing it on the back of his chair weve asked but they dont seem to think we need one have a seat harry doesnt look as if perkins is in yetharry squeezed himself into the chair behind perkinss desk while mr weasley riffled through the sheaf of parchment kingsley shacklebolt had given himah he said grinning as he extracted a copy of a magazine entitled the quibbler from its midst yes he flicked through it yes hes right im sure sirius will find that very amusing oh dear whats this nowa memo had just zoomed in through the open door and fluttered to rest on top of the hiccoughing toaster mr weasley unfolded it and read it aloudthird regurgitating public toilet reported in bethnal green kindly investigate immediately this is getting ridiculous a regurgitating toiletantimuggle pranksters said mr weasley frowning we had two last week one in wimbledon one in elephant and castle muggles are pulling the flush and instead of everything disappearing well you can imagine the poor things keep calling

catch themoh no this is too trivial for aurors itll be the ordinary magical law enforcement patrol ah harry this is perkinsa stooped timidlooking old wizard with fluffy white hair had just entered the room pantingoh arthur he said desperately without looking at harry thank goodness i didnt know what to do for the best whether to wait here for you or not ive just sent an owl to your home but youve obviously missed it an urgent message came ten minutes ago i know about the regurgitating toilet said mr weasleyno no its not the toilet its the potter boys hearing theyve changed the time and venue it starts at eight oclock now and its down in old courtroom ten down in old but they told me merlins beardmr weasley looked at his watch let out a yelp and leapt from his chairquick harry we should have been there five minutes agoperkins flattened himself against the filing cabinets as mr weasley left the office at a run harry close on his heelswhy have they changed the time harry said breathlessly as they hurtled past the auror cubicles people poked out their heads and stared as they streaked past harry felt as though hed felt all his insides back at perkinss deskive no idea but thank goodness we got here so early if youd missed it it would have been catastrophicmr weasley skidded to a halt beside the lifts and jabbed impatiently at the down buttoncome onthe lift clattered into view and they hurried inside every time it stopped mr weasley cursed furiously and pummelled the number nine buttonthose courtrooms havent been used in years said mr weasley angrily i cant think why theyre doing it down there unless but no a plump witch carrying a smoking goblet entered the lift at that moment and mr weasley did not elaboratethe atrium said the cool female voice and the golden grilles slid open showing harry a distant glimpse of the golden statues in the fountain the plump witch got out and a sallowskinned wizard with a very mournful face got inmorning arthur he said in a sepulchral voice as the lift began to descend dont often see you down hereurgent business bode said mr weasley who was bouncing on the balls of his feet and throwing anxious looks over at harryah yes said bode surveying harry unblinkingly of courseharry barely had emotion to spare for bode but his unfaltering gaze did not make him feel any more comfortabledepartment of mysteries said the cool female voice and left it at thatquick harry said mr weasley as the lift doors rattled open and they sped up a corridor that was quite different from those above the walls were bare there were no windows and no doors apart from a plain black one set at the very end of the corridor harry expected them to go through it but instead mr weasley seized him by the arm and dragged him to the left where there was an opening leading to a flight of stepsdown here down here panted mr weasley taking two steps at a time the lift doesnt even come down this far why theyre doing it down there i they reached the bottom of the steps and ran along yet another corridor which bore a great resemblance to the one that led to snapes dungeon at hogwarts with rough stone walls and torches in brackets the doors they passed here were heavy wooden ones with iron bolts and keyholescourtroom ten i think were nearly yesmr weasley stumbled to a halt outside a grimy dark door with an immense iron lock and slumped against the wall clutching at a stitch in his chestgo on he panted pointing his thumb at the door get in therearent arent you coming with no no im not allowed good luckharrys heart was beating a violent tattoo against his adams apple he swallowed hard turned the heavy iron door handle and stepped inside the courtroomchapter eight the hearingharry gasped he could not help himself the large dungeon he had entered was horribly familiar he had not only seen it before he had been here before this was the place he had visited inside dumbledores pensieve the place where he had watched the lestranges sentenced to life imprisonment in azkabanthe walls were made of dark stone dimly lit by torches empty benches rose on either side of him but ahead in the highest benches of all were many shadowy figures they had been talking in low voices but as the heavy door swung closed behind harry an ominous silence fella cold male voice rang across the courtroomyoure latesorry said harry nervously i i didnt know the time had been changedthat is not the wizengamots fault said the voice an owl was sent to you this morning take your seatharry dropped his gaze to the chair in the centre of the room the arms of which were covered in chains he had seen those chains spring to life and bind whoever sat between them his footsteps echoed loudly as he walked across the stone floor when he sat gingerly on the edge of the chair the chains clinked threateningly but did not bind him feeling rather sick he looked up at the people seated at the bench abovethere were about fifty of them all as far as he could see wearing plumcoloured robes with an elaborately worked silver w on the lefthand side of the chest and all staring down their noses at him some with very austere expressions others looks of frank curiosityin the very middle of the front row sat cornelius fudge the minister for magic fudge was a portly man who often sported a limegreen bowler hat though today he had dispensed with it he had dispensed too with the indulgent smile he had once worn when he spoke to harry a broad squarejawed witch with very short grey hair sat on fudges left she wore a monocle and looked forbidding on fudges right was another witch but she was sitting so far back on the bench that her face was in shadowvery well said fudge the accused being present finally let us begin are you ready he called down the rowyes sir said an eager voice harry knew rons brother percy was sitting at the very end of the front bench harry looked at percy expecting some sign of recognition from him but none came percys eyes behind his hornrimmed glasses were fixed on his parchment a quill poised in his handdisciplinary hearing of the twelfth of august said fudge in a ringing voice and percy began taking notes at once into offences committed under the decree for the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery and the international statute of secrecy by harryjames potter resident at number four privet drive little whinging surreyinterrogators cornelius oswald fudge minister for magic amelia susan bones head of the department of magical law enforcement dolores jane umbridge senior undersecretary to the minister court scribe percy ignatius weasley witness for the defence albus percival wulfric brian dumbledore said a quiet voice from behind harry who turned his head so fast he cricked his neckdumbledore was striding serenely across the room wearing long midnightblue robes and a perfectly calm expression his long silver beard and hair gleamed in the torchlight as he drew level with harry and looked up at fudge through the halfmoon spectacles that rested halfway down his very crooked nosethe members of the wizengamot were muttering all eyes were now on dumbledore some looked annoyed others slightly frightened two elderly witches in the back row however raised their hands and waved in welcomea powerful emotion had risen in harrys chest at the sight of dumbledore a fortified hopeful feeling rather like that which phoenix song gave him he wanted to catch dumbledores eye but dumbledore was not looking his way he was continuing to look up at the obviously flustered fudgeah said fudge who looked thoroughly disconcerted dumbledore yes you er got our er message that the time and er place of the hearing had been changed theni must have missed it said dumbledore cheerfully however due to a lucky mistake i arrived at the ministry three hours early so no harm doneyes well i suppose well need another chair i weasley could you not to worry not to worry said dumbledore pleasantly he took out his wand gave it a little flick and a squashy chintz armchair appeared out of nowhere next to harry dumbledore sat down out the tips of his long fingers together and surveyed fudge over them with an expression of polite interest the wizengamot was still muttering and fidgeting restlessly only when fudge spoke again did they settle downyes said fudge again shuffling his notes well then so the charges yeshe extricated a piece of parchment from the pile before him took a deep breath and read out the charges against the accused are as followsthat he did knowingly deliberately and in full awareness of the illegality of his actions having received a previous written warning from the ministry of magic on a similar charge produce a patronus charm in a muggleinhabited area in the presence of a muggle on the second of august at twentythree minutes past nine which constitutes an offence under paragraph c of the decree for the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery and also under section of the international confederation of warlocks statute of secrecyyou are harry james potter of number four privet drive little whinging surrey fudge said glaring at harry over the top of his parchmentyes harry saidyou received an official warning from the ministry for using illegal magic three years ago did you notyes but and yet you conjured a patronus on the night of the second of august said fudgeyes said harry but knowing that you are not permitted to use magic outside school while you are under the age of seventeenyes but knowing that you were in an area full of mugglesyes but fully aware that you were in close proximity to a muggle at the timeyes said harry angrily but i only used it because we were the witch with the monocle cut across him in a booming voiceyou produced a fullyfledged patronusyes said harry because a corporeal patronusa what said harryyour patronus had a clearly defined form i mean to say it was more than vapour or smokeyes said harry feeling both impatient and slightly desperate its a stag its always a stagalways boomed madam bones you have produced a patronus before nowyes said harry ive been doing it for over a yearand you are fifteen years oldyes and you learned this at schoolyes professor lupin taught me in my third year because of the impressive said madam bones staring down at him a true patronus at his age very impressive indeedsome of the wizards and witches around her were muttering again a few nodded but others were frowning and shaking their headsits not a question of how impressive the magic was said fudge in a testy voice in fact the more impressive the worse it is i would have thought given that the boy did it in plain view of a mugglethose who had been frowning now murmured in agreement but it was the sight of percys sanctimonious little nod that goaded harry into speechi did it because of the dementors he said loudly before anyone could interrupt him againhe had expected more muttering but the silence that fell seemed to be somehow denser than beforedementors said madam bones after a moment her thick eyebrows rising until her monocle looked in danger of falling out what do you mean boyi mean there were two dementors down that alleyway and they went for me and my cousinah said fudge again smirking unpleasantly as he looked around at the wizengamot as though inviting them to share the joke yes yes i thought wed be hearing something like thisdementors in little whinging madam bones said in a tone of great surprise i dont understand dont you amelia said fudge still smirking let me explain hes been thinking it through and decided dementors would make a very nice little cover story very nice indeed muggles cant see dementors can they boy highly convenient highly convenient so its just your word and no witnesses im not lying said harry loudly over another outbreak of muttering from the court there were two of them coming from opposite ends of the alley everything went dark and cold and my cousin felt them and ran for it enough enough said fudge with a very supercilious look on his face im sorry to interrupt what im sure would have been a very wellrehearsed story dumbledore cleared his throat the wizengamot fell silent againwe do in fact have a witness to the presence of dementors in that alleyway he said other than dudley dursley i meanfudges plump face seemed to slacken as though somebody had let air out of it he stared down at dumbledore for a moment or two then with the appearance of a man pulling himself back together said we havent got time to listen to more tarradiddles im afraid dumbledore i want this dealt with quickly i may be wrong said dumbledore pleasantly but i am sure that under the wizengamot charter of rights the accused has the right to present witnesses for his or her case isnt that the policy of the department of magical law enforcement madam bones he continued addressing the witch in the monocletrue said madam bones perfectly trueoh very well very well snapped fudge where is this personi brought her with me said dumbledore shes just outside the door should i no weasley you go fudge barked at percy who got up at once ran down the stone steps from the judges balcony and hurried past dumbledore and harry without glancing at thema moment later percy returned followed by mrs figg she looked scared and more batty than ever harry wished she had thought to change out of her carpet slippersdumbledore stood up and gave mrs figg his chair conjuring a second one for himselffull name said fudge loudly when mrs figg had perched herself nervously on the very edge of her seatarabella doreen figg said mrs figg in her quavery voiceand who exactly are you said fudge in a bored and lofty voiceim a resident of little whinging close to where harry potter lives said mrs figgwe have no record of any witch or wizard living in little whinging other than harry potter said madam bones at once that situation has always been closely monitored given given past eventsim a squib said mrs figg so you wouldnt have me registered would youa squib eh said fudge eyeing her closely well be checking that youll leave details of your parentage with my assistant weasley incidentally can squibs see dementors he added looking left and right along the benchyes we can said mrs figg indignantlyfudge looked back down at her his eyebrows raised very well he said aloofly what is your storyi had gone out to buy cat food from the corner shop at the end of wisteria walk around about nine oclock on the evening of the second of august gabbled mrs figg at once as though she had learned what she was saying by heart when i heard a disturbance down the alleyway between magnolia crescent and wisteria walk on approaching the mouth of the alleyway i saw dementors running running said madam bones sharply dementors dont run they glidethats what i meant to say said mrs figg quickly patches of pink appearing in her withered cheeks gliding along the alley towards what looked like two boyswhat did they look like said madam bones narrowing her eyes so that the edge of the monocle disappeared into her fleshwell one was very large and the other one rather skinny no no said madam bones impatiently the dementors describe themoh said mrs figg the pink flush creeping up her neck now they were big big and wearing cloaksharry felt a horrible sinking in the pit of his stomach whatever mrs figg might say it sounded to him as though the most she had ever seen was a picture of a dementor and a picture could never convey the truth of what these beings were like the eerie way they moved hovering inches over the ground or the rotting smell of them or that terrible rattling noise they made as they sucked on the surrounding air in the second row a dumpy wizard with a large black moustache leaned close to whisper in the ear of his neighbour a frizzyhaired witch she smirked and noddedbig and wearing cloaks repeated madam bones coolly while fudge snorted derisively i see anything elseyes said mrs figg i felt them everything went cold and this was a very warm summers night mark you and i felt as though all happiness had gone from the world and i remembered dreadful things her voice shook and diedmadam boness eyes widened slightly harry could see red marks under her eyebrow where the monocle had dug into itwhat did the dementors do she asked and harry felt a rush of hopethey went for the boys said mrs figg her voice stronger and more confident now the pink flush ebbing away from her face one of them had fallen the other was backing away trying to repel the dementor that was harry he tried twice and produced only silver vapour on the third attempt he produced a patronus which charged down the first dementor and then with his encouragement chased the second one away from his cousin and that that is what happened mrs figg finished somewhat lamelymadam bones looked down at mrs figg in silence fudge was not looking at her at all but fidgeting with his papers finally he raised his eyes and said rather aggressively thats what you saw is itthat is what happened mrs figg repeatedvery well said fudge you may gomrs figg cast a frightened look from fudge to dumbledore then got up and shuffled off towards the door harry heard it thud shut behind hernot a very convincing witness said fudge loftilyoh i dont know said madam bones in her booming voice she certainly described the effects of a dementor attack very accurately and i cant imagine why she would say they were there if they werentbut dementors wandering into a muggle suburb and just happening to come across a wizard snorted fudge the odds on that must be very very long even bagman wouldnt have bet oh i dont think any of us believe the dementors were there by coincidence said dumbledore lightlythe witch sitting to the right of fudge with her face in shade w moved slightly but everyone else was quite still and silentand what is that supposed to mean fudge asked icilyit means that i think they were ordered there said dumbledorei think we might have a record of it if someone had ordered a pair of dementors to go strolling through little whinging barked fudgenot if the dementors are taking orders from someone other than the ministry of magic these days said dumbledore calmly i have already given you my views on this matter corneliusyes you have said fudge forcefully and i have no reason to believe that your views are anything other than bilge dumbledore the dementors remain in place in azkaban and are doing everything we ask them tothen said dumbledore quietly but clearly we must ask ourselves why somebody within the ministry ordered a pair of dementors into that alleyway on the second of augustin the complete silence that greeted these words the witch to the right of fudge leaned forwards so that harry saw her for the first timehe thought she looked just like a large pale toad she was rather squat with a broad flabby face as little neck as uncle vernon and a very wide slack mouth her eyes were large round and slightly bulging even the little black velvet bow perched on top of her short curly hair put him in mind of a large fly she was about to catch on a long sticky tonguethe chair recognises dolores jane umbridge senior undersecretary to the minister said fudgethe witch spoke in a fluttery girlish highpitched voice that took harry aback he had been expecting a croakim sure i must have misunderstood you professor dumbledore she said with a simper that felt her big round eyes as cold as ever so silly of me but it sounded for a teensy moment as though you were suggesting that the ministry of magic had ordered an attack on this boyshe gave a silvery laugh that made the hairs on the back of harrys neck stand up a few other members of the wizengamot laughed with her it could not have been plainer that not one of them was really amusedif it is true that the dementors are taking orders only from the ministry of magic and it is also true that two dementors attacked harry and his cousin a week ago then it follows logically that somebody at the ministry might have ordered the attacks said dumbledore politely of course these particular dementors may have been outside ministry control there are no dementors outside ministry control snapped fudge who had turned brick reddumbledore inclined his head in a little bowthen undoubtedly the ministry will be making a full inquiry into why two dementors were so very far from azkaban and why they attacked without authorisationit is not for you to decide what the ministry of magic does or does not do dumbledore snapped fudge now a shade of magenta of which uncle vernon would have been proudof course it isnt said dumbledore mildly i was merely expressing my confidence that this matter will not go uninvestigatedhe glanced at madam bones who readjusted her monocle and stared back at him frowning slightlyi would remind everybody that the behaviour of these dementors if indeed they are not figments of this boys imagination is not the subject of this hearing said fudge we are here to examine harry potters offences under the decree for the reasonable restriction of underage sorceryof course we are said dumbledore but the presence of dementors in that alleyway is highly relevant clause seven of the decree states that magic may be used before muggles in exceptional circumstances and as those exceptional circumstances include situations which threaten the life of the wizard or witch him or herself or any witches wizards or muggles present at the time of the we are familiar with clause seven thank you very much snarled fudgeof course you are said dumbledore courteously then we are in agreement that harrys use of the patronus charm in these circumstances falls precisely into the category of exceptional circumstances the clause describesif there were dementors which i doubtyou have heard it from an eyewitness dumbledore interruptedif you still doubt her truthfulness call her back question her again i am sure she would not objecti that not blustered fudge fiddling with the papers before him its i want this over with today dumbledorebut naturally you would not care how many times you heard from a witness if the alternative was a serious miscarriage of justice said dumbledoreserious miscarriage my hat said fudge at the top of his voice have you ever bothered to tot up the number of cockandbull stories this boy has come out with dumbledore while trying to cover up his flagrant misuse of magic out of school i suppose youve forgotten the hover charm he used three years ago that wasnt me it was a houseelf said harryyou see roared fudge gesturing flamboyantly in harrys direction a houseelf in a muggle house i ask youthe houseelf in question is currently in the employ of hogwarts school said dumbledore i can summon him here in an instant to give evidence if you wishi not i havent got time to listen to houseelves anyway thats not the only he blew up his aunt for gods sake fudge shouted banging his fist on the judges bench and upsetting a bottle of inkand you very kindly did not press charges on that occasion accepting i presume that even the best wizards cannot always control their emotions said dumbledore calmly as fudge attempted to scrub the ink off his notesand i havent even started on what he gets up to at schoolbut as the ministry has no authority to punish hogwarts students for misdemeanours at school harrys behaviour there is not relevant to this hearing said dumbledore as politely as ever but now with a suggestion of coolness behind his wordsoho said fudge not our business what he does at school eh you think sothe ministry does not have the power to expel hogwarts students cornelius as i reminded you on the night of the second of august said dumbledore nor does it have the right to confiscate wands until charges have been successfully proven again as i reminded you on the night of the second of august in your admirable haste to ensure that the law is upheld you appear inadvertently i am sure to have overlooked a few laws yourselflaws can be changed said fudge savagelyof course they can said dumbledore inclining his head and you certainly seem to be making many changes cornelius why in the few short weeks since i was asked to leave the wizengamot it has already become the practice to hold a full criminal trial to deal with a simple matter of underage magica few of the wizards above them shifted uncomfortably in their seats fudge turned a slightly deeper shade of puce the toadlike witch on his right however merely gazed at dumbledore her face quite expressionlessas far as i am aware dumbledore continued there is no law yet in place that says this courts job is to punish harry for every bit of magic he has ever performed he has been charged with a specific offence and he has presented his defence all he and i can do now is to await your verdictdumbledore put his fingertips together again and said no more fudge glared at him evidently incensed harry glanced sideways at dumbledore seeking reassurance he was not at all sure that dumbledore was right in telling the wizengamot in effect that it was about time they made a decision again however dumbledore seemed oblivious to harrys attempt to catch his eye he continued to look up at the benches where the entire wizengamot had fallen into urgent whispered conversationsharry looked at his feet his heart which seemed to have swollen to an unnatural size was thumping loudly under his ribs he had expected the hearing to last longer than this he was not at all sure that he had made a good impression he had not really said very much he ought to have explained more fully about the dementors about how he had fallen over about how both he and dudley had nearly been kissed twice he looked up at fudge and opened his mouth to speak but his swollen heart was now constricting his air passages and both times he merely took a deep breath and looked back down at his shoesthen the whispering stopped harry wanted to look up at the judges but found that it was really much much easier to keep examining his lacesthose in favour of clearing the witness of all charges said madam boness booming voiceharrys head jerked upwards there were hands in the air many of them more than half breathing very fast he tried to count but before he could finish madam bones had said and those in favour of convictionfudge raised his hand so did half a dozen others including the witch on his right and the heavilymoustached wizard and the frizzyhaired witch in the second rowfudge glanced around at them all looking as though there was something large stuck in his throat then lowered his own hand he took two deep breaths and said in a voice distorted by suppressed rage very well very well cleared of all chargesexcellent said dumbledore briskly springing to his feel pulling out his wand and causing the two chintz armchairs to vanish well i must be getting along goodday to you alland without looking once at harry he swept from the dungeonchapter nine the woes of mrs weasleydumbledores abrupt departure took harry completely by surprise he remained sitting where he was in the chained chair struggling with his feelings of shock and relief the wizengamot were all getting to their feet talking gathering up their papers and packing them away harry stood up nobody seemed to be paying him the slightest bit of attention except the toadlike witch on fudges right who was now gazing down at him instead of at dumbledore ignoring her he tried to catch fudges eye or madam boness wanting to ask whether he was free to go but fudge seemed quite determined not to notice harry and madam bones was busy with her briefcase so he took a lew tentative steps towards the exit and when nobody called him back broke into a very fast walkhe took the last lew steps at a run wrenched open the door and almost collided with mr weasley who was standing right outside looking pale and apprehensivedumbledore didnt say cleared harry said pulling the door closed behind him of all chargesbeaming mr weasley seized harry by the shouldersharry thats wonderful well of course they couldnt have found you guilty not on the evidence but even so i cant pretend i wasnt but mr weasley broke off because the courtroom door had ust opened again the wizengamot were filing outmerlins beard exclaimed mr weasley wonderingly pulling harry aside to let them all pass you were tried by the lull courti think so said harry quietlyone or two of the wizards nodded to harry as they passed and a few including madam bones said morning arthur to mr weasley but most averted their eyes cornelius fudge and the toadlike witch were almost the last to leave the dungeon fudge acted as though mr weasley and harry were part of the wall hut again the witch looked almost appraisingly at harry as she passed last of all to pass was percy like fudge he completely ignored his father and harry he marched past clutching a large roll of parchment and a handful of spare quills his back rigid and his nose in the air the lines around mr weasleys mouth tightened slightly but other than this he gave no sign that he had seen his third sonim going to take you straight back so you can tell the others the good news he said beckoning harry forwards as percys heels disappeared up the steps to level nine ill drop you off on the way to that toilet in bethnal green come on so what will you have to do about the toilet harry asked grinning everything suddenly seemed five times funnier than usual it was starting to sink in he was cleared he was going back to hogwartsoh its a simple enough antijinx said mr weasley as they mounted the stairs but its not so much having to repair the damage its more the attitude behind the vandalism harry mugglebaiting might strike some wizards as funny but its an expression of something much deeper and nastier and i for one mr weasley broke off in midsentence they had just reached the ninthlevel corridor and cornelius fudge was standing a few feet away from them talking quietly to a tall man with sleek blond hair and a pointed pale facethe second man turned at the sound of their footsteps he too broke off in midconversation his cold grey eyes narrowed and fixed upon harrys facewell well well patronus potter said lucius malfoy coollyharry felt winded as though he had just walked into something solid he had last seen those cold grey eyes through slits in a death haters hood and last heard that mans voice jeering in a dark graveyard while lord voldemort tortured him harry could not believe that lucius malfoy dared look him in the face he could not believe that he was here in the ministry of magic or that cornelius fudge was talking to him when harry had told fudge mere weeks ago that malfoy was a death eaterthe minister was just telling me about your lucky escape potter drawled mr malfoy quite astonishing the way you continue to wriggle out of very tight holes snakelike in factmr weasley gripped harrys shoulder in warningyeah said harry yeah im good at escapinglucius malfoy raised his eyes to mr weasleys faceand arthur weasley too what are you doing here arthuri work here said mr weasley curtlynot here surely said mr malfoy raising his eyebrows and glancing towards the door over mr weasleys shoulder i thought you were up on the second floor dont you do something that involves sneaking muggle artefacts home and bewitching themno mr weasley snapped his fingers now biting into harrys shoulderwhat are you doing here anyway harry asked lucius malfoyi dont think private matters between myself and the minister are any concern of yours potter said malfoy smoothing the front of his robes harry distinctly heard the gentle clinking of what sounded like a full pocket of gold really just because you are dumbledores favourite boy you must not expect the same indulgence from the rest of us shall we go up to your office then ministercertainly said fudge turning his back on harry and mr weasley this way luciusthey strode off together talking in low voices mr weasley did not let go of harrys shoulder until they had disappeared into the liftwhy wasnt he waiting outside fudges office if theyve got business to do together harry burst out furiously what was he doing down heretrying to sneak down to the courtroom if you ask me said mr weasley looking extremely agitated and glancing over his shoulder as though making sure they could not be overheard trying to find out whether youd been expelled or not ill leave a note for dumbledore when i drop you off he ought to know malfoys been talking to fudge againwhat private business have they got together anywaygold i expect said mr weasley angrily malfoys been giving generously to all sorts of things for years gets him in with the right people then he can ask favours delay laws he doesnt want passed oh hes very wellconnected lucius malfoythe lift arrived it was empty except for a flock of memos that flapped around mr weasleys head as he pressed the button for the atrium and the doors clanged shut he waved them away irritablymr weasley said harry slowly if fudge is meeting death eaters like malfoy if hes seeing them alone how do we know they havent put the imperius curse on himdont think it hasnt occurred to us harry said mr weasley quietly but dumbledore thinks fudge is acting of his own accord at the moment which as dumbledore says is not a lot of comfort best not talk about it any more just now harrythe doors slid open and they stepped out into the now almostdeserted atrium eric the watchwizard was hidden behind his daily prophet again they had walked straight past the golden fountain before harry rememberedwait he told mr weasley and pulling his moneybag from his pocket he turned back to the fountainhe looked up into the handsome wizards face but closeto harry thought he looked rather weak and foolish the witch was wearing a vapid smile like a beauty contestant and from what harry knew of goblins and centaurs they were most unlikely to be caught staring so soppily at humans of any description only the houseelfs attitude of creeping servility looked convincing with a grin at the thought of what hermione would say if she could see the statue of the elf harry turned his moneybag upsidedown and emptied not just ten galleons but the whole contents into the pooli knew it yelled ron punching the air you always get away with stuffthey were bound to clear you said hermione who had looked positively faint with anxiety when harry had entered the kitchen and was now holding a shaking hand over her eyes there was no case against you none at alleveryone seems quite relieved though considering you all knew id get off said harry smilingmrs weasley was wiping her face on her apron and fred george and ginny were doing a kind of war dance to a chant that went he got off he got off he got off thats enough settle down shouted mr weasley though he too was smiling listen sirius lucius malfoy was at the ministry what said sirius sharplyhe got off he got off he got off be quiet you three yes we saw him talking to fudge on level nine then they went up to fudges office together dumbledore ought to knowabsolutely said sirius well tell him dont worrywell id better get going theres a vomiting toilet waiting for me in bethnal green molly ill be late im covering for tonks but kingsley might be dropping in for dinner he got off he got off he got off thats enough fred george ginny said mrs weasley as mr weasley left the kitchen harry dear come and sit down have some lunch you hardly ate breakfastron and hermione sat themselves down opposite him looking happier than they had done since he had first arrived at grimmauld place and harrys feeling of giddy relief which had been somewhat dented by his encounter with lucius malfoy swelled again the gloomy house seemed warmer and more welcoming all of a sudden even kreacher looked less ugly as he poked his snoutlike nose into the kitchen to investigate the source of all the noisecourse once dumbledore turned up on your side there was no way they were going to convict you said ron happily now dishing great mounds of mashed potato on to everyones platesyeah he swung it for me said harry he felt it would sound highly ungrateful not to mention childish to say i wish hed talked to me though or even looked at meand as he thought this the scar on his forehead burned so badlythat he clapped his hand to itwhats up said hermione looking alarmedscar harry mumbled but its nothing it happens all the time now none of the others had noticed a thing all of them were now helping themselves to food while gloating over harrys narrow escape fred george and ginny were still singing hermione looked rather anxious but before she could say anything ron had said happily i bet dumbledore turns up this evening to celebrate with us you knowdont think hell be able to ron said mrs weasley setting a huge plate of roast chicken down in front of harry hes really very busy at the momenthe got off he got off he got offshut up roared mrs weasleyover the next few days harry could not help noticing that there was one person within number twelve grimmauld place who did not seem wholly overjoyed that he would be returning to hogwarts sirius had put up a very good show of happiness on first hearing the news wringing harrys hand and beaming just like the rest of them soon however he was moodier and surlier than before talking less to everybody even harry and spending increasing amounts of time shut up in his mothers room with buckbeakdont you go feeling guilty said hermione sternly after harry had confided some of his feelings to her and ron while they scrubbed out a mouldy cupboard on the third floor a few days later you belong at hogwarts and sirius knows it personally i think hes being selfishthats a bit harsh hermione said ron frowning as he attempted to prise off a bit of mould that had attached itself firmly to his finger you wouldnt want to be stuck inside this house without any companyhell have company said hermione its headquarters to the order of the phoenix isnt it he just got his hopes up that harry would be coming to live here with himi dont think thats true said harry wringing out his cloth he wouldnt give me a straight answer when i asked him if i couldhe just didnt want to get his own hopes up even more said hermione wisely and he probably felt a bit guilty himself because i think a part of him was really hoping youd be expelled then youd both be outcasts togethercome off it said harry and ron together but hermione merely shruggedsuit yourselves but i sometimes think rons mums right and sirius gets confused about whether youre you or your father harryso you think hes touched in the head said harry heatedlyno i just think hes been very lonely for a long time said hermione simplyat this point mrs weasley entered the bedroom behind themstill not finished she said poking her head into the cupboardi thought you might be here to tell us to have a break said ron bitterly dyou know how much mould weve got rid of since we arrived hereyou were so keen to help the order said mrs weasley you can do your bit by making headquarters fit to live ini feel like a houseelf grumbled ronwell now you understand what dreadful lives they lead perhaps youll be a bit more active in spew said hermione hopefully as mrs weasley left them to it you know maybe it wouldnt be a bad idea to show people exactly how horrible it is to clean all the time we could do a sponsored scrub of gryffindor common room all proceeds to spew it would raise awareness as well as fundsill sponsor you to shut up about spew ron muttered irritably but only so harry could hear himharry found himself daydreaming about hogwarts more and more as the end of the holidays approached he could not wait to see hagrid again to play quidditch even to stroll across the vegetable patches to the herbology greenhouses it would be a treat just to leave this dusty musty house where half of the cupboards were still bolted shut and kreacher wheezed insults out of the shadows as you passed though harry was careful not to say any of this within earshot of siriusthe fact as that living at the headquarters of the antivoldemort movement was not nearly as interesting or exciting as harry would have expected before hed experienced it though members of the order of the phoenix came and went regularly sometimes staying for meals sometimes only for a few minutes of whispered conversation mrs weasley made sure that harry and the others were kept well out of earshot whether extendable or normal and nobody not even sirius seemed to feel that harry needed to know anything more than he had heard on the night of his arrivalon the very last day of the holidays harry was sweeping up hedwigs owl droppings from the top of the wardrobe when ron entered their bedroom carrying a couple of envelopesbooklists have arrived he said throwing one of the envelopes up to harry who was standing on a chair about time i thought theyd forgotten they usually come much earlier than this harry swept the last of the droppings into a rubbish bag and threw the bag over rons head into the wastepaper basket in the corner which swallowed it and belched loudly he then opened his letter it contained two pieces of parchment one the usual reminder that term started on the first of september the other telling him which books he would need for the coming yearonly two new ones he said reading the list the standard book of spells grade by miranda goshawk and defensive magical theory by wilbert slinkhardcrackfred and george apparated right beside harry he was so used to them doing this by now that he didnt even fall off his chairwe were just wondering who set the slinkhard book said fred conversationallybecause it means dumbledores found a new defence against the dark arts teacher said georgeand about time too said fredwhat dyou mean harry asked jumping down beside themwell we overheard mum and dad talking on the extendable ears a few weeks back fred told harry and from what they were saying dumbledore was having real trouble finding anyone to do the job this yearnot surprising is it when you look at whats happened to the last four said georgeone sacked one dead ones memory removed and one locked in a trunk for nine months said harry counting them off on his fingers yeah i see what you meanwhats up with you ron asked fredron did not answer harry looked round ron was standing very still with his mouth slightly open gaping at his letter from hogwartswhats the matter said fred impatiently moving around ron to look over his shoulder at the parchmentfreds mouth fell open tooprefect he said staring incredulously at the letter prefectgeorge leapt forwards seized the envelope in rons other hand and turned it upsidedown harry saw something scarlet and gold fall into georges palmno way said george in a hushed voicetheres been a mistake said fred snatching the letter out of rons grasp and holding it up to the light as though checking for a watermark no one in their right mind would make ron a prefectthe twins heads turned in unison and both of them stared at harrywe thought you were a cert said fred in a tone that suggested harry had tricked them in some waywe thought dumbledore was bound to pick you said george indignantlywinning the triwizard and everything said fredi suppose all the mad stuff mustve counted against him said george to fredyeah said fred slowly yeah youve caused too much trouble mate well at least one of yous got their priorities righthe strode over to harry and clapped him on the back while giving ron a scathing lookprefect ickle ronnie the prefectohh mums going to be revolting groaned george thrusting the prefect badge back at ron as though it might contaminate himron who still had not said a word took the badge stared at it for a moment then held it out to harry as though asking mutely for confirmation that it was genuine harry took it a large p was superimposed on the gryffindor lion he had seen a badge just like this on percys chest on his very first day at hogwartsthe door banged open hermione came tearing into the room her cheeks flushed and her hair flying there was an envelope in her handdid you did you get she spotted the badge in harrys hand and let out a shrieki knew it she said excitedly brandishing her letter me too harry me toono said harry quickly pushing the badge back into rons hand its ron not meit whatrons prefect not me harry saidron said hermione her jaw dropping but are you sure i mean she turned red as ron looked round at her with a defiant expression on his laceits my name on the letter he saidi said hermione looking thoroughly bewildered i well wow well done ron thats really unexpected said george noddingno said hermione blushing harder than ever no its not rons done loads of hes really the door behind her opened a little wider and mrs weasley bucked into the room carrying a pile of freshly laundered robesginny said the booklists had come at last she said glancing around at all the envelopes as she made her way over to the bed and started sorting the robes into two piles if you give them to me ill take them over to diagon alley this afternoon and get your books while youre packing ron ill have to get you more pyjamas these are at least six inches too short i cant believe how fast youre growing what colour would you likeget him red and gold to match his badge said george smirkingmatch his what said mrs weasley absently rolling up a pair of maroon socks and placing them on rons pilehis badge said fred with the air of getting the worst over quickly his lovely shiny new prefects badgefreds words took a moment to penetrate mrs weasleys preoccupation with pyjamashis but ron youre not ron held up his badgemrs weasley let out a shriek just like hermionesi dont believe it i dont believe it oh ron how wonderful a prefect thats everyone in the familywhat are fred and i nextdoor neighbours said george indignantly as his mother pushed him aside and flung her arms around her youngest sonwait until your father hears ron im so proud of you what wonderful news you could end up head boy just like bill and percy its the first step oh what a thing to happen in the middle of all this worry im just thrilled oh ronnie fred and george were both making loud retching noises behind her back but mrs weasley did not notice arms tight around rons neck she was kissing him all over his face which had turned a brighter scarlet than his badgemum dont mum get a grip he muttered trying to push her awayshe let go of him and said breathlessly well what will it be we gave percy an owl but youve already got one of coursewwhat do you mean said ron looking as though he did not dare believe his earsyouve got to have a reward for this said mrs weasley fondly how about a nice new set of dress robesweve already bought him some said fred sourly who looked as though he sincerely regretted this generosityor a new cauldron charlies old ones rusting through or a new rat you always liked scabbers mum said ron hopefully can i have a new broommrs weasleys face fell slightly broomsticks were expensivenot a really good one ron hastened to add just just a new one for a change mrs weasley hesitated then smiledof course you can well id better get going if ive got a broom to buy too ill see you all later little ronnie a prefect and dont forget to pack your trunks a prefect oh im all of a dithershe gave ron yet another kiss on the cheek sniffed loudly and bustled from the roomfred and george exchanged looksyou dont mind if we dont kiss you do you ron said fred in a falsely anxious voicewe could curtsey if you like said georgeoh shut up said ron scowling at themor what said fred an evil grin spreading across his face going to put us in detentionid love to see him try sniggered georgehe could if you dont watch out said hermione angrilyfred and george burst out laughing and ron muttered drop it hermionewere going to have to watch our step george said fred pretending to tremble with these two on our case yeah it looks like our lawbreaking days are finally over said cieorge shaking his headand with another loud crack the twins disapparatedthose two said hermione furiously staring up at the ceiling through which they could now hear fred and george roaring with laughter in the room upstairs dont pay any attention to them ron theyre only jealousi dont think they are said ron doubtfully also looking up at the ceiling theyve always said only prats become prefects still he added on a happier note theyve never had new brooms i wish i could go with mum and choose shell never be able to afford a nimbus but theres the new cleansweep out thatd be great yeah i think ill go and tell her i like the cleansweep just so she knows he dashed from the room leaving harry and hermione alonefor some reason harry found he did not want to look at hermione he turned to his bed picked up the pile of clean robes mrs weasley had laid on it and crossed the room to his trunkharry said hermione tentativelywell done hermione said harry so heartily it did not sound like his voice at all and still not looking at her brilliant prefect greatthanks said hermione erm harry could i borrow hedwig so i can tell mum and dad theyll be really pleased i mean prefect is something they can understandyeah no problem said harry still in the horrible hearty voice that did not belong to him take herhe leaned over his trunk laid the robes on the bottom of it and pretended to be rummaging for something while hermione crossed to the wardrobe and called hedwig down a few moments passed harry heard the door close but remained bent double listening the only sounds he could hear were the blank picture on the wall sniggering again and the wastepaper basket in the corner coughing up the owl droppingshe straightened up and looked behind him hermione had left and hedwig had gone harry hurried across the room closed the door then returned slowly to his bed and sank on to it gazing unseeingly at the foot of the wardrobehe had forgotten completely about prefects being chosen in the fifth year he had been too anxious about the possibility of being expelled to spare a thought for the fact that badges must be winging their way towards certain people but if he had remembered if he had thought about it what would he have expectednot this said a small and truthful voice inside his headharry screwed up his face and buried it in his hands he could not lie to himself if he had known the prefect badge was on its way he would have expected it to come to him not ron did this make him as arrogant as draco malfoy did he think himself superior to everyone else did he really believe he was better than ronno said the small voice defiantlywas that true harry wondered anxiously probing his own feelingsim better at quidditch said the voice but im not better at anything elsethat was definitely true harry thought he was no better than ron in lessons but what about outside lessons what about those adventures he ron and hermione had had together since starting at hogwarts often risking much worse than expulsionwell ron and hermione were with me most of the time said the voice in harrys headnot all the time though harry argued with himself they didnt fight quirrell with me they didnt take on riddle and the basilisk they didnt get rid of all those dementors the night sirius escaped they werent in that graveyard with me the night voldemort returned and the same feeling of illusage that had overwhelmed him on the night he had arrived rose again ive definitely done more harry thought indignantly ive done more than either of thembut maybe said the small voice fairly maybe dumbledore doesnt choose prefects because theyve got themselves into a load of dangerous situations maybe he chooses them for other reasons ron must have something you dont harry opened his eyes and stared through his fingers at the wardrobes clawed feet remembering what fred had said no one in their right mind would make ron a prefect harry gave a small snort of laughter a second later he felt sickened with himselfron had not asked dumbledore to give him the prefect badge this was not rons fault was he harry rons best friend in the world going to sulk because he didnt have a badge laugh with the twins behind rons back ruin this for ron when for the first time he had beaten harry at somethingat this point harry heard rons footsteps on the stairs again he stood up straightened his glasses and hitched a grin on to his face as ron bounded back through the doorjust caught her he said happily she says shell get the cleansweep if she cancool harry said and he was relieved to hear that his voice had stopped sounding hearty listen ron well done matethe smile faded off rons facei never thought it would be me he said shaking his head i thought it would be younah ive caused too much trouble harry said echoing fredyeah said ron yeah i suppose well wed better get our trunks packed hadnt weit was odd how widely their possessions seemed to have scattered themselves since they had arrived it took them most of the afternoon to retrieve their books and belongings from all over the house and stow them back inside their school trunks marry noticed that ron kept moving his prefects badge around first placing it on his bedside table then putting it into his jeans pocket then taking it out and lying it on his folded robes as though to see the effect of the red on the black only when fred and george dropped in and offered to attach it to his forehead with a permanent sticking charm did he wrap it tenderly in his maroon socks and lock it in his trunkmrs weasley returned from diagon alley around six oclock laden with books and carrying a long package wrapped in thick brown paper that ron took from her with a moan of longingnever mind unwrapping it now people are arriving for dinner i want you all downstairs she said but the moment she was out of sight ron ripped off the paper in a frenzy and examined every inch of his new broom an ecstatic expression on his facedown in the basement mrs weasley had hung a scarlet banner over the heavily laden dinner table which readcongratulationsron and hermionenew prefectsshe looked in a better mood than harry had seen her all holidayi thought wed have a little party not a sitdown dinner she told harry ron hermione fred george and ginny as they entered the room your father and bill are on their way ron ive sent them both owls and theyre thrilled she added beamingfred rolled his eyessirius lupin tonks and kingsley shacklebolt were alreadythere and madeye moody stumped in shortly after harry had got himself a butterbeeroh alastor i am glad youre here said mrs weasley brightly as madeye shrugged off his travelling cloak weve been wanting to ask you for ages could you have a look in the writing desk in the drawing room and tell us whats inside it we havent wanted to open it just in case its something really nastyno problem molly moodys electricblue eye swivelled upwards and stared fixedly through the ceiling of the kitchendrawing room he growled as the pupil contracted desk in the corner yeah i see it yeah its a boggart want me to go up and get rid of it mollyno no ill do it myself later beamed mrs weasley you have your drink were having a little bit of a celebration actually she gestured at the scarlet banner fourth prefect in the family she said fondly ruffling rons hairprefect eh growled moody his normal eye on ron and his magical eye swivelling around to gaze into the side of his head harry had the very uncomfortable feeling it was looking at him and moved away towards sirius and lupinwell congratulations said moody still glaring at ron with his normal eye authority figures always attract trouble but i suppose dumbledore thinks you can withstand most major jinxes or he wouldnt have appointed you ron looked rather startled at this view of the matter but was saved the trouble of responding by the arrival of his father and eldest brother mrs weasley was in such a good mood she did not even complain that they had brought mundungus with them he was wearing a long overcoat that seemed oddly lumpy in unlikely places and declined the offer to remove it and put it with moodys travelling cloakwell i think a toast is in order said mr weasley when everyone had a drink he raised his goblet to ron and hermione the new gryffindor prefectsron and hermione beamed as everyone drank to them and then applaudedi was never a prefect myself said tonks brightly from behind harry as everybody moved towards the table to help themselves to food her hair was tomato red and waistlength today she looked like ginnys older sister my head of house said i lacked certain necessary qualitieslike what said ginny who was choosing a baked potatolike the ability to behave myself said tonksginny laughed hermione looked as though she did not know whether to smile or not and compromised by taking an extra large gulp of butterbeer and choking on itwhat about you sirius ginny asked thumping hermione on the backsirius who was right beside harry let out his usual barklike laughno one would have made me a prefect i spent too much time in detention with james lupin was the good boy he got the badgei think dumbledore might have hoped i would be able to exercise some control over my best friends said lupin i need scarcely say that i failed dismallyharrys mood suddenly lifted his father had not been a prefect either all at once the party seemed much more enjoyable he loaded up his plate feeling doubly fond of everyone in the roomron was rhapsodising about his new broom to anybody who would listennought to seventy in ten seconds not bad is it when you think the comet two ninetys only nought to sixty and thats with a decent tailwind according to which broomstickhermione was talking very earnestly to lupin about her view of elf rightsi mean its the same kind of nonsense as werewolf segregation isnt it it all stems from this horrible thing wizards have of thinking theyre superior to other creatures mrs weasley and bill were having their usual argument about bills hairgetting really out of hand and youre so goodlooking it would look much better shorter wouldnt it harryoh i dunno said harry slightly alarmed at being asked his opinion he slid away from them in the direction of fred and george who were huddled in a corner with mundungusmundungus stopped talking when he saw harry but fred winked and beckoned harry closerits ok he told mundungus we can trust harry hes our financial backerlook what dungs got us said george holding out his hand to harry it was full of what looked like shrivelled black pods a faint rattling noise was coming from them even though they were completely stationaryvenomous tentacula seeds said george we need them for the skiving snackboxes but theyre a class c nontradeable substance so weve been having a bit of trouble getting hold of themten galleons the lot then dung said fredwiv all the trouble i went to to get em said mundungus his saggy bloodshot eyes stretching even wider im sorry lads but im not taking a knut under twentydung likes his little joke fred said to harryyeah his best one so far has been six sickles for a bag of knarl quills said georgebe careful harry warned them quietlywhat said fred mums busy cooing over prefect ron were okbut moody could have his eye on you harry pointed outmundungus looked nervously over his shouldergood point that he grunted all right lads ten it is if youll take em quickcheers harry said fred delightedly when mundungus had emptied his pockets into the twins outstretched hands and scuttled off towards the food wed better get these upstairs harry watched them go feeling slightly uneasy it had just occurred to him that mr and mrs weasley would want to know how fred and george were financing their joke shop business when as was inevitable they finally found out about it giving the twins his triwizard winnings had seemed a simple thing to do at the time but what if it led to another family row and a percylike estrangement would mrs weasley still feel that harry was as good as her son if she found out he had made it possible for fred and george to start a career she thought quite unsuitablestanding where the twins had left him with nothing but a guilty weight in the pit of his stomach for company harry caught the sound of his own name kingsley shacklebolts deep voice was audible even over the surrounding chatterwhy dumbledore didnt make potter a prefect said kingsleyhell have had his reasons replied lupinbut it wouldve shown confidence in him its what idve done persisted kingsley specially with the daily prophet having a go at him every few days harry did not look round he did not want lupin or kingsley to know he had heard though not remotely hungry he followed mundungus back towards the table his pleasure in the party had evaporated as quickly as it had come he wished he were upstairs in bedmadeye moody was sniffing at a chickenleg with what remained of his nose evidently he could not detect any trace of poison because he then tore a strip off it with his teeththe handles made of spanish oak with antijinx varnish and inbuilt vibration control ron was saying to tonksmrs weasley yawned widelywell i think ill sort out that boggart before i turn in arthur i dont want this lot up too late all right night harry dearshe left the kitchen harry set down his plate and wondered whether he could follow her without attracting attentionyou all right potter grunted moodyyeah fine lied harrymoody took a swig from his hipflask his electricblue eye staring sideways at harrycome here ive got something that might interest you he saidfrom an inner pocket of his robes moody pulled a very tattered old wizarding photographoriginal order of the phoenix growled moody found it last night when i was looking for my spare invisibility cloak seeing as podmore hasnt had the manners to return my best one thought people might like to see itharry took the photograph a small crowd of people some waving at him others lifting their glasses looked back up at himtheres me said moody unnecessarily pointing at himself the moody in the picture was unmistakeable though his hair was slightly less grey and his nose was intact and theres dumbledore beside me dedalus diggle on the other side thats marlene mckinnon she was killed two weeks after this was taken they got her whole family thats frank and alice longbottom harrys stomach already uncomfortable clenched as he looked at alice longbottom he knew her round friendly face very well even though he had never met her because she was the image of her son nevillepoor devils growled moody better dead than what happened to them and thats emmeline vance youve met her and that theres lupin obviously benjy fenwick he copped it too we only ever found bits of him shift aside there he added poking the picture and the little photographic people edged sideways so that those who were partially obscured could move to the frontthats edgar bones brother of amelia bones they got him and his family too he was a great wizard sturgis podmore blimey he looks young caradoc dearborn vanished six months after this we never found his body hagrid of course looks exactly the same as ever elphias doge youve met him id forgotten he used to wear that stupid hat gideon prewett it took five death eaters to kill him and his brother fabian they fought like heroes budge along budge along the little people in the photograph jostled among themselves and those hidden right at the back appeared at the forefront of the picturethats dumbledores brother aberforth only time i ever met him strange bloke thats dorcas meadowes voldemort killed her personally sirius when he still had short hair and there you go thought that would interest youharrys heart turned over his mother and father were beaming up at him sitting on either side of a small wateryeyed man whom harry recognised at once as wormtail the one who had betrayed his parents whereabouts to voldemort and so helped to bring about their deathseh said moodyharry looked up into moody s heavily scarred and pitted face evidently moody was under the impression he had just given harry a bit of a treatyeah said harry once again attempting to grin er listen ive just remembered i havent packed my he was spared the trouble of inventing an object he had not packed sirius had just said whats that youve got there madeye and moody had turned towards him harry crossed the kitchen slipped through the door and up the stairs before anyone could call him backhe did not know why it had been such a shock he had seen pictures of his parents before after all and he had met wormtail but to have them sprung on him like that when he was least expecting it no one would like that he thought angrily and then to see them surrounded by all those other happy faces benjy fenwick who had been found in bits and gideon prewett who had died like a hero and the longbottoms who had been tortured into madness all waving happily out of the photograph forever more not knowing that they were doomed well moody might find that interesting he harry found it disturbing harry tiptoed up the stairs in the hall past the stuffed elfheads glad to be on his own again but as he approached the first landing he heard noises someone was sobbing in the drawing roomhello harry saidthere was no answer but the sobbing continued he climbed the remaining stairs two at a time walked across the landing and opened the drawingroom doorsomeone was cowering against the dark wall her wand in her hand her whole body shaking with sobs sprawled on the dusty old carpet in a patch of moonlight clearly dead was ronall the air seemed to vanish from harrys lungs he felt as though he were falling through the floor his brain turned icy cold ron dead no it couldnt be but wait a moment it couldnt be ron was downstairs mrs weasley harry croakedr r riddikulus mrs weasley sobbed pointing her shaking wand at rons bodycrackrons body turned into bills spreadeagled on his back his eyes wide open and empty mrs weasley sobbed harder than everr riddikulus she sobbed againcrackmr weasleys body replaced bills his glasses askew a trickle of blood running down his faceno mrs weasley moaned no riddikulus riddikulus riddikuluscrack dead twins crack dead percy crack dead harry mrs weasley just get out of here shouted harry staring down at his own dead body on the floor let someone else whats going onlupin had come running into the room closely followed by sirius with moody stumping along behind them lupin looked from mrs weasley to the dead harry on the floor and seemed to understand in an instant pulling out his own wand he said very firmly and clearlyriddikulusharrys body vanished a silvery orb hung in the air over the spot where it had lain lupin waved his wand once more and the orb vanished in a puff of smokeoh oh oh gulped mrs weasley and she broke into a storm of crying her face in her handsmolly said lupin bleakly walking over to her molly dont next second she was sobbing her heart out on lupins shouldermolly it was just a boggart he said soothingly patting her on the head just a stupid boggart i see them d d dead all the time mrs weasley moaned into his shoulder all the t t time i d d dream about it sirius was staring at the patch of carpet where the boggart pretending to be harrys body had lain moody was looking at harry who avoided his gaze he had a funny feeling moodys magical eye had followed him all the way out of the kitchend d dont tell arthur mrs weasley was gulping now mopping her eyes frantically with her cuffs i d d dont want him to know being silly lupin handed her a handkerchief and she blew her noseharry im so sorry what must you think of me she said shakily not even able to get rid of a boggart dont be stupid said harry trying to smileim just s s so worried she said tears spilling out of her eyes again half the f f familys in the order itll b b be a miracle if we all come through this and p p percys not talking to us what if something dd dreadful happens and weve never m m made it up with him and whats going to happen if arthur and i get killed whos g g going to look after ron and ginnymolly thats enough said lupin firmly this isnt like last time the order are better prepared weve got a head start we know what voldemorts up to mrs weasley gave a little squeak of fright at the sound of the nameoh molly come on its about time you got used to hearing his name look i cant promise no ones going to get hurt nobody can promise that but were much better off than we were last time you werent in the order then you dont understand last time we were outnumbered twenty to one by the death eaters and they were picking us off one by one harry thought of the photograph again of his parents beaming faces he knew moody was still watching himdont worry about percy said sirius abruptly hell come round its only a matter of time before voldemort moves into the open once he does the whole ministrys going to be begging us to forgive them and im not sure ill be accepting their apology he added bitterlyand as for whos going to look after ron and ginny if you and arthur died said lupin smiling slightly what do you think wed do let them starvemrs weasley smiled tremulouslybeing silly she muttered again mopping her eyesbut harry closing his bedroom door behind him some ten minutes later could not think mrs weasley silly he could still see his parents beaming up at him from the battered old photograph unaware that their lives like so many of those around them were drawing to a close the image of the boggart posing as the corpse of each member of mrs weasleys family in turn kept flashing before his eyeswithout warning the scar on his forehead seared with pain again and his stomach churned horriblycut it out he said firmly rubbing the scar as the pain recededfirst sign of madness talking to your own head said a sly voice from the empty picture on the wallharry ignored it he felt older than he had ever felt in his life and it seemed extraordinary to him that barely an hour ago he had been worried about a joke shop and who had got a prefects badgechapter ten luna lovegoodharry had a troubled nights sleep his parents wove in and out of his dreams never speaking mrs weasley sobbed over kreachers dead body watched by ron and hermione who were wearing crowns and yet again harry found himself walking clown a corridor ending in a locked door he awoke abruptly with his scar prickling to find ron already dressed and talking to himbetter hurry up mums going ballistic she says were going to miss the train there was a lot of commotion in the house from what he heard as he dressed at top speed harry gathered that fred and george had bewitched their trunks to fly downstairs to save the bother of carrying them with the result that they had hurtled straight into ginny and knocked her down two flights of stairs into the hall mrs black and mrs weasley were both screaming at the top of their voicescould have done her a serious injury you idiots filthy halfbreeds besmirching the house of my fathers hermione came hurrying into the room looking flustered just as harry was putting on his trainers hedwig was swaying or her shoulder and she was carrying a squirming crookshanks in her armsmum and dad just sent hedwig back the owl fluttered obligingly over and perched on top of her cage are you ready yetnearly is ginny all right harry asked shoving on his glassesmrs weasleys patched her up said hermione but now madeyes complaining that we cant leave unless sturgis podmores here otherwise the guard will be one shortguard said harry we have to go to kings cross with a guardyou have to go to kings cross with a guard hermione corrected himwhy said harry irritably i thought voldemort was supposed to be lying low or are you telling me hes going to jump out from behind a dustbin to try and do me ini dont know its just what madeye says said hermione distractedly looking at her watch but if we dont leave soon were definitely going to miss the train will you lot get down here now please mrs weasley bellowed and hermione jumped as though scalded and hurried out of the room harry seized hedwig stuffed her unceremoniously into her cage and set off downstairs after hermione dragging his trunkmrs blacks portrait was howling with rage but nobody was bothering to close the curtains over her all the noise in the hall was bound to rouse her again anywayharry youre to come with me and tonks shouted mrs weasley over the repeated screeches of mudbloods scum creatures of dirt leave your trunk and your owl alastors going to deal with the luggage oh for heavens sake sirius dumbledore said noa bearlike black dog had appeared at harrys side as he was clambering over the various trunks cluttering the hall to get to mrs weasleyoh honestly said mrs weasley despairingly well on your own head be itshe wrenched open the front door and stepped out into the weak september sunlight harry and the dog followed her the door slammed behind them and mrs blacks screeches were cut off instantlywheres tonks harry said looking round as they went down the stone steps of number twelve which vanished the moment they reached the pavementshes waiting for us just up here said mrs weasley stiffly averting her eyes from the lolloping black dog beside harryan old woman greeted them on the corner she had tightly curled grey hair and wore a purple hat shaped like a pork piewotcher harry she said winking better hurry up hadnt we molly she added checking her watchi know i know moaned mrs weasley lengthening her stride but madeye wanted to wait for sturgis if only arthur could have got us cars from the ministry again but fudge wont let him borrow so much as an empty ink bottle these days how muggles can stand travelling without magic but the great black dog gave a joyful bark and gambolled around them snapping at pigeons and chasing its own tail harry couldnt help laughing sirius had been trapped inside for a very long time mrs weasley pursed her lips in an almost aunt petuniaish wayit took them twenty minutes to reach kings cross on foot and nothing more eventful happened during that time than sirius scaring a couple of cats for harrys entertainment once inside the station they lingered casually beside the barrier between platforms nine and ten until the coast was clear then each of them leaned against it in turn and fell easily through on to platform nine and threequarters where the hogwarts express stood belching sooty steam over a platform packed with departing students and their families harry inhaled the familiar smell and felt his spirits soar he was really going back i hope the others make it in time said mrs weasley anxiously staring behind her at the wroughtiron arch spanning the platform through which new arrivals would comenice dog harry called a tall boy with dreadlocksthanks lee said harry grinning as sirius wagged his tail franticallyoh good said mrs weasley sounding relieved heres alastor with the luggage look a porters cap pulled low over his mismatched eyes moody came limping through the archway pushing a trolley loaded with their trunksall ok he muttered to mrs weasley and tonks dont think we were followed seconds later mr weasley emerged on to the platform with ron and hermione they had almost unloaded moodys luggage trolley when fred george and ginny turned up with lupinno trouble growled moodynothing said lupinill still be reporting sturgis to dumbledore said moody thats the second time

mrs weasley distractedly hugging them at random and catching harry twice write be good if youve forgotten anything well send it on on to the train now hurry for one brief moment the great black dog reared on to its hind legs and placed its front paws on harrys shoulders but mrs weasley shoved harry away towards the train door hissing for heavens sake act more like a dog siriussee you harry called out of the open window as the train began to move while ron hermione and ginny waved beside him the figures of tonks lupin moody and mr and mrs weasley shrank rapidly but the black dog was bounding alongside the window wagging its tail blurred people on the platform were laughing to see it chasing the train then they rounded a bend and sirius was gonehe shouldnt have come with us said hermione in a worried voiceoh lighten up said ron he hasnt seen daylight for months poor blokewell said fred clapping his hands together cant stand around chatting all day weve got business to discuss with lee see you later and he and george disappeared down the corridor to the rightthe train was gathering still more speed so that the houses outside the window flashed past and they swayed where they stoodshall we go and find a compartment then harry askedron and hermione exchanged lookser said ronwere well ron and i are supposed to go into the prefect carnage hermione said awkwardlyron wasnt looking at harry he seemed to have become intensely interested in the fingernails on his left handoh said harry right finei dont think well have to stay there all journey said hermione quickly our letters said we just get instructions from the head boy and girl and then patrol the corridors from time to timefine said harry again well i i might see you later thenyeah definitely said ron casting a shifty anxious look at harry its a pain having to go down there id rather but we have to i mean im not enjoying it im not percy he finished defiantlyi know youre not said harry and he grinned but as hermione and ron dragged their trunks crookshanks and a caged pigwidgeon off towards the engine end of the train harry felt an odd sense of loss he had never travelled on the hogwarts express without roncome on ginny told him if we get a move on well be able to save them placesright said harry picking up hedwigs cage in one hand and the handle of his trunk in the other they struggled off down the corridor peering through the glasspanelled doors into the compartments they passed which were already full harry could not help noticing that a lot of people stared back at him with great interest and that several of them nudged their neighbours and pointed him out after he had met this behaviour in five consecutive carriages he remembered that the daily prophet had been telling its readers all summer what a lying showoff he was he wondered dully whether the people now staring and whispering believed the storiesin the very last carriage they met neville longbottom harrys fellow fifthyear gryffindor his round face shining with the effort of pulling his trunk along and maintaining a onehanded grip on his struggling toad trevorhi harry he panted hi ginny everywheres full i cant find a seat what are you talking about said ginny who had squeezed past neville to peer into the compartment behind him theres room in this one theres only loony lovegood in here neville mumbled something about not wanting to disturb anyonedont be silly said ginny laughing shes all rightshe slid the door open and pulled her trunk inside harry and neville followedhi luna said ginny is it ok if we take these seatsthe girl beside the window looked up she had straggly waistlength dirty blonde hair very pale eyebrows and protuberant eyes that gave her a permanently surprised look harry knew at once why neville had chosen to pass this compartment by the girl gave oil an aura of distinct dottiness perhaps it was the fact that she had stuck her wand behind her left ear for safekeeping or that she had chosen to wear a necklace of butterbeer corks or that she was reading a magazine upsidedown her eyes ranged over neville and came to rest on harry she noddedthanks said ginny smiling at herharry and neville stowed the three trunks and hedwigs cage in the luggage rack and sat down luna watched them over her upsidedown magazine which was called the quibbler she did not seem to need to blink as much as normal humans she stared and stared at harry who had taken the seat opposite her and now wished he hadnthad a good summer luna ginny askedyes said luna dreamily without taking her eyes off harry yes it was quite enjoyable you know youre harry potter she addedi know i am said harryneville chuckled luna turned her pale eyes on him insteadand i dont know who you areim nobody said neville hurriedlyno youre not said ginny sharply neville longbottom luna lovegood lunas in my year but in ravenclawwit beyond measure is mans greatest treasure said luna in a singsong voiceshe raised her upsidedown magazine high enough to hide her face and fell silent harry and neville looked at each other with their eyebrows raised ginny suppressed a gigglethe train rattled onwards speeding them out into open country it was an odd unsettled sort of day one moment the carriage was full of sunlight and the next they were passing beneath ominously grey cloudsguess what i got for my birthday said nevilleanother remembrall said harry remembering the marblelike device nevilles grandmother had sent him in an effort to improve his abysmal memoryno said neville i could do with one though i lost the old one ages ago no look at this he dug the hand that was not keeping a firm grip on trevor into his schoolbag and after a little bit of rummaging pulled out what appeared to be a small grey cactus in a pot except that it was covered with what looked like boils rather than spinesmimbulus mimbletonia he said proudlyharry stared at the thing it was pulsating slightly giving it the rather sinister look of some diseased internal organits really really rare said neville beaming i dont know if theres one in the greenhouse at hogwarts even i cant wait to show it to professor sprout my great uncle algie got it for me in assyria im going to see if i can breed from itharry knew that nevilles favourite subject was herbology but for the life of him he could not see what he would want with this stunted little plantdoes it er do anything he askedloads of stuff said neville proudly its got an amazing defensive mechanism here hold trevor for me he dumped the toad into harrys lap and took a quill from his schoolbag luna lovegoods popping eyes appeared over the top of her upsidedown magazine again to watch what neville wasdoing neville held the mimbulus mimblctonia up to his eyes his tongue between his teeth chose his spot and gave the plant a sharp prod with the tip of his quillliquid squirted from every boil on the plant thick stinking dark green jets of it they hit the ceiling the windows and spattered luna lovegoods magazine ginny who had flung her arms up in front of her face just in time merely looked as though she was wearing a slimy green hat but harry whose hands had been busy preventing trevors escape received a faceful it smelled like rancid manureneville whose face and torso were also drenched shook his head to get the worst out of his eyess sorry he gasped i havent tried that before didnt realise it would be quite so dont worry though stinksaps not poisonous he added nervously as harry spat a mouthful on to the floorat that precise moment the door of their compartment slid openoh hello harry said a nervous voice urn bad timeharry wiped the lenses of his glasses with his trevorfree hand a very pretty girl with long shiny black hair was standing in the doorway smiling at him cho chang the seeker on the ravenclaw quidditch teamoh hi said harry blanklyum said cho well just thought id say hello bye thenrather pink in the face she closed the door and departed harry slumped back in his seat and groaned he would have liked cho to discover him sitting with a group of very cool people laughing their heads off at a joke he had just told he would not have chosen to be sitting with neville and loony lovegood clutching a toad and dripping in stinksapnever mind said ginny bracingly look we can easily get rid of all this she pulled out her wand scourgifythe stinksap vanishedsorry said neville again in a small voiceron and hermione did not turn up for nearly an hour by which time the food trolley had already gone by harry ginny and neville had finished their pumpkin pasties and were busy swapping chocolate frog cards when the compartment door slid open and they walked in accompanied by crookshanks and a shrilly hooting pigwidgeon in his cageim starving said ron stowing pigwidgeon next to hedwig grabbing a chocolate frog from harry and throwing himself into the seat next to him he ripped open the wrapper bit off the frogs head and leaned back with his eyes closed as though he had had a very exhausting morningwell there are two fifthyear prefects from each house said hermione looking thoroughly disgruntled as she took her seat boy and girl from eachand guess whos a slytherin prefect said ron still with his eyes closedmalfoy replied harry at once certain his worst fear would be confirmedcourse said ron bitterly stuffing the rest of the frog into his mouth and taking anotherand that complete cow pansy parkinson said hermione viciously how she got to be a prefect when shes thicker than a concussed troll who are hufflepuffs harry askedernie macmillan and hannah abbott said ron thicklyand anthony goldstein and padma patil for ravenclaw said hermioneyou went to the yule ball with padma patil said a vague voiceeveryone turned to look at luna lovegood who was gazing unblinkingly at ron over the top of the quibbler he swallowed his mouthful of frogyeah i know i did he said looking mildly surprisedshe didnt enjoy it very much luna informed him she doesnt think you treated her very well because you wouldnt dance with her i dont think id have minded she added thoughtfully i dont like dancing very muchshe retreated behind the quibbler again ron stared at the cover with his mouth hanging open for a few seconds then looked around at ginny for some kind of explanation but ginny had stuffed her knuckles in her mouth to stop herself giggling ron shook his head bemused then checked his watchwere supposed to patrol the corridors every so often he told harry and neville and we can give out punishments if people are misbehaving i cant wait to get crabbe and goyle for something youre not supposed to abuse your position ron said hermione sharplyyeah right because malfoy wont abuse it at all said ron sarcasticallyso youre going to descend to his levelno im just going to make sure i get his mates before he gets minefor heavens sake ron ill make goyle do lines itll kill him he hates writing said ron happily he lowered his voice to goyles low grunt and screwing up his face in a look of pained concentration mimed writing in midair i must not look like a baboons backsideeveryone laughed but nobody laughed harder than luna lovegood she let out a scream of mirth that caused hedwig to wake up and flap her wings indignantly and crookshanks to leap up into the luggage rack hissing luna laughed so hard her magazine slipped out of her grasp slid down her legs and on to the floorthat was funnyher prominent eyes swam with tears as she gasped for breath staring at ron utterly nonplussed he looked around at the others who were now laughing at the expression on rons face and at the ludicrously prolonged laughter of luna lovegood who was rocking backwards and forwards clutching her sidesare you taking the mickey said ron frowning at herbaboons backside she choked holding her ribseveryone else was watching luna laughing but harry glancing at the magazine on the floor noticed something that made him dive for it upsidedown it had been hard to tell what the picture on the front was but harry now realised i was a fairly bad cartoon of cornelius fudge harry only recognised him because of the limegreen bowler hat one of fudges hands was clenched around a bag of gold the other hand was throttling a goblin the cartoon was captioned how far will fudge go to gain gringottsbeneath this were listed the titles of other articles inside the magazinecorruption in the quidditch leaguehow the tornados are taking controlsecrets of the ancient runes revealedsirius black villain or victimcan i have a look at this harry asked luna eagerlyshe nodded still gazing at ron breathless with laughterharry opened the magazine and scanned the index until this moment he had completely forgotten the magazine kingsley had handed mr weasley to give to sirius but it must have been this edition of the quibblerhe found the page and turned excitedly to the articlethis too was illustrated by a rather bad cartoon in fact harry would not have known it was supposed to be sirius if it hadnt been captioned sirius was standing on a pile of human bones with his wand out the headline on the article saidsirius black as hes paintednotorious mass murderer or innocent singing sensationharry had to read this first sentence several times before he was convinced that he had not misunderstood it since when had sirius been a singing sensationfor fourteen years sirius black has been believed guilty of the mass murder of twelve innocent muggles and one wizard blacks audacious escape from azkaban two years ago has led to the widest manhunt ever conducted by the ministry of magic none of us has ever questioned that he deserves to be recaptured and handed back to the dementorsbut does hestartling new evidence has recently come to light that sirius black may not have committed the crimes for which he was sent to azhaban in fact says doris purkiss of acanthia way little norton black may not even have been present at the killingswhat people dont realise is that sirius black is a false name says mrs purkiss the man people believe to be sirius black is actually stubby boardman lead singer of popular singing group the hobgoblins who retired from public life after being struck on the ear by a turnip at a concert in little norton church hall nearly fifteen years ago i recognised him the moment i saw his picture in the paper now stubby couldnt possibly have committed those crimes because on the day in question he happened to be enjoying a romantic candlelit dinner with me i have written to the minister for magic and am expecting him to give stubby alias sirius a full pardon any day nowharry finished reading and stared at the page in disbelief perhaps it was a joke he thought perhaps the magazine often printed spoof items he flicked back a few pages and found the piece on fudgecornelius fudge the minister for magic denied that he had any plans to take over the running of the wizarding bank gringotts when he was elected minister for magic jive years ago fudge has always insisted that he wants nothing more than to cooperate peacefully with the guardians of our goldbut does hesources close to the minister have recently disclosed that fudges dearest ambition is to seize control of the goblin gold supplies and that he will not hesitate to use force if need beit wouldnt be the first time either said a ministry insider cornelius goblincrusher fudge thats what his friends call him if you could hear him when he thinks no ones listening oh hes always talking about the goblins hes had done in hes had them drowned hes had them dropped off buildings hes had them poisoned hes had them cooked in pies harry did not read any further fudge might have many faults but harry found it extremely hard to imagine him ordering goblins to be cooked in pies he flicked through the rest of the magazine pausing every few pages he read an accusation that the tutshill tornados were winning the quidditch league by a combination of blackmail illegal broomtampering and torture an interview with a wizard who claimed to have flown to the moon on a cleansweep six and brought back a bag of moon frogs to prove it and an article on ancient runes which at least explained why luna had been reading the quibbler upsidedown according to the magazine if you turned the runes on their heads they revealed a spell to make your enemys ears turn into kumquats in fact compared to the rest of the articles in the quibbler the suggestion that sirius might really be the lead singer of the hobgoblins was quite sensibleanything good in there asked ron as harry closed the magazineof course not said hermione scathingly before harry could answer the quibblers rubbish everyone knows thatexcuse me said luna her voice had suddenly lost its dreamy quality my fathers the editori oh said hermione looking embarrassed well its got some interesting i mean its quiteill have it back thank you said luna coldly and leaning forwards she snatched it out of harrys hands riffling through it to page fiftyseven she turned it resolutely upsidedown again and disappeared behind it just as the compartment door opened for the third timeharry looked around he had expected this but that did not make the sight of draco malfoy smirking at him from between his cronies crabbe and goyle any more enjoyablewhat he said aggressively before malfoy could open his mouthmanners potter or ill have to give you a detention drawled malfoy whose sleek blond hair and pointed chin were just like his fathers you see i unlike you have been made a prefect which means that i unlike you have the power to hand out punishmentsyeah said harry but you unlike me are a git so get out and leave us aloneron hermione ginny and neville laughed malfoys lip curledtell me how does it feel being secondbest to weasley potter he askedshut up malfoy said hermione sharplyi seem to have touched a nerve said malfoy smirking well just watch yourself potter because ill be dogging your footsteps in case you step out of lineget out said hermione standing upsniggering malfoy gave harry a last malicious look and departed with crabbe and goyle lumbering along in his wake hermione slammed the compartment door behind them and turned to look at harry who knew at once that she like him had registered what malfoy had said and been just as unnerved by itchuck us another frog said ron who had clearly noticed nothingharry could not talk freely in front of neville and luna he exchanged another nervous look with hermione then stared out of the windowhe had thought sirius coming with him to the station was a bit of a laugh but suddenly it seemed reckless if not downright dangerous hermione had been right sirius should not have come what if mr malfoy had noticed the black dog and told draco what if he had deduced that the weasleys lupin tonks and moody knew where sirius was hiding or had malfoys use of the word dogging been a coincidencethe weather remained undecided as they travelled further and farther north rain spattered the windows in a halfhearted way then the sun put in a feeble appearance before clouds drifted over it once more when darkness fell and lamps came on inside the carriages luna rolled up the quibbler put it carefully away ii her bag and took to staring at everyone in the compartment insteadharry was sitting with his forehead pressed against the train window trying to get a first distant glimpse of hogwarts but it was a moonless night and the rainstreaked window was grimywed better change said hermione at last and all of them opened their trunks with difficulty and pulled on their school robes she and ron pinned their prefect badges carefully to their chests harry saw ron checking his reflection in the black windowat last the train began to slow down and they heard the usual racket up and down it as everybody scrambled to get their luggage and pets assembled ready to get on as ron and hermione were supposed to supervise all this they disappeared from the carriage again leaving harry and the others to look after crookshanks and pigwidgeonill carry that owl if you like said luna to harry reaching out for pigwidgeon as neville stowed trevor carefully in an inside pocketoh er thanks said harry handing her the cage and hoisting hedwigs more securely into his armsthey shuffled out of the compartment feeling the first sting of the night air on their faces as they joined the crowd in the corridor slowly they moved towards the doors harry could smell the pine trees that lined the path down to the lake he stepped down on to the platform and looked around listening for the familiar call of firsyears over ere firsyears but it did not come instead a quite different voice a brisk female one was calling out firstyears line up over here please all firstyears to mea lantern came swinging towards harry and by its light he saw the prominent chin and severe haircut of professor grubblyplank the witch who had taken over hagrids care of magical creatures lessons for a while the previous yearwheres hagrid he said out loudi dont know said ginny but wed better get out of the way were blocking the dooroh yeah harry and ginny became separated as they moved off along the platform and out through the station jostled by the crowd harry squinted through the darkness for a glimpse of hagrid he had to be here harry had been relying on it seeing hagrid again was one of the things hed been looking forward to most but there was no sign of himhe cant have left harry told himself as he shuffled slowly through a narrow doorway on to the road outside with the rest of the crowd hes just got a cold or something he looked around for ron or hermione wanting to know what they thought about the reappearance of professor grubblyplank but neither of them was anywhere near him so he allowed himself to be shunted forwards on to the dark rainwashed road outside hogsmeade stationhere stood the hundred or so horseless stagecoaches that always took the students above first year up to the castle harry glanced quickly at them turned away to keep a lookout for ron and hermione then did a doubletakethe coaches were no longer horseless there were creatures standing between the carriage shafts if he had had to give them a name he supposed he would have called them horses though there was something reptilian about them too they were completely fleshless their black coats clinging to their skeletons of which every bone was visible their heads were dragonish and their pupilless eyes white and staring wings sprouted from each wither vast black leathery wings that looked as though they ought to belong to giant bats standing still and quiet in the gathering gloom the creatures looked eerie and sinister harry could not understand why the coaches were being pulled by these horrible horses when they vere quite capable of moving along by themselveswheres pig said rons voice right behind harrythat luna girl was carrying him said harry turning quickly eager to consult ron about hagrid where dyou reckon hagrid is i dunno said ron sounding worried hed better be ok a short distance away draco malfoy followed by a small gang of cronies including crabbe goyle and pansy parkinson was pushing some timidlooking secondyears out of the way so that he and his friends could get a coach to themselves seconds later hermione emerged panting from the crowdmalfoy was being absolutely foul to a firstyear back there i swear im going to report him hes only had his badge three minutes and hes using it to bully people worse than ever wheres crookshanksginnys got him said harry there she is ginny had just emerged from the crowd clutching a squirming crookshanksthanks said hermione relieving ginny of the cat come on lets get a carriage together before they all fill up i havent got pig yet ron said but hermione was already heading off towards the nearest unoccupied coach harry remained behind with ronwhat are those things dyou reckon he asked ron nodding at the horrible horses as the other students surged past themwhat thingsthose horse luna appeared holding pigwidgeons cage in her arms the tiny owl was twittering excitedly as usualhere you are she said hes a sweet little owl isnt heer yeah hes all right said ron gruffly well come on then lets get in what were you saying harryi was saying what are those horse things harry said as he ron and luna made for the carriage in which hermione and ginny were already sittingwhat horse thingsthe horse things pulling the carriages said harry impatiently they were after all about three feet from the nearest one it was watching them with empty white eyes ron however gave harry a perplexed lookwhat are you talking aboutim talking about lookharry grabbed rons arm and wheeled him about so that he was face to face with the winged horse ron stared straight at it for a second then looked back at harrywhat am i supposed to be looking atat the there between the shafts harnessed to the coach its right there in front but as ron continued to look bemused a strange thought occurred to harrycant cant you see themsee whatcant you see whats pulling the carriagesron looked seriously alarmed noware you feeling all right harryi yeah harry felt utterly bewildered the horse was there in front of him gleaming solidly in the dim light issuing from the station windows behind them vapour rising from its nostrils in the chilly night air yet unless ron was faking and it was a very feeble joke if he was ron could not see it at allshall we get in then said ron uncertainly looking at harry as though worried about himyeah said harry yeah go on its all right said a dreamy voice from beside harry as ron vanished into the coachs dark interior youre not going mad or anything i can see them toocan you said harry desperately turning to luna he could see the batwinged horses reflected in her wide silvery eyesoh yes said luna ive been able to see them ever since my first day here theyve always pulled the carriages dont worry youre just as sane as i amsmiling faintly she climbed into the musty interior of the carriage alter ron not altogether reassured harry followed herchapter eleven the sorting hatsnew songharry did not want to tell the others that he and luna were having the same hallucination if that was what it was so he said nothing more about the horses as he sat down inside the carriage and slammed the door behind him nevertheless he could not help watching the silhouettes of the horses moving beyond the windowdid everyone see that grubblyplank woman asked ginny whats she doing back here hagrid cant have left can heill be quite glad if he has said luna he isnt a very good teacher is heyes he is said harry ron and ginny angrilyharry glared at hermione she cleared her throat and quickly said erm yes hes very goodwell we in ravenclaw think hes a bit of a joke said luna unfazedyouve got a rubbish sense of humour then ron snapped as the wheels below them creaked into motionluna did not seem perturbed by rons rudeness on the contrary she simply watched him for a while as though he were a mildly interesting television programmerattling and swaying the carriages moved in convoy up the road when they passed between the tall stone pillars topped with winged boars on either side of the gates to the school grounds harry leaned forwards to try and see whether there were any lights on in hagrids cabin by the forbidden forest but the grounds were in complete darkness hogwarts castle however loomed evercloser a towering mass of turrets jet black against the dark sky here and there a window blazing fiery bright above themthe carriages jingled to a halt near the stone steps leading up to the oak front doors and harry got out of the carriage first he turned again to look for lit windows down by the forest but there was definitely no sign of life within hagrids cabin unwillingly because he had halfhoped they would have vanished he turned his eyes instead upon the strange skeletal creatures standing quietly in the chill night air their blank white eyes gleamingharry had once before had the experience of seeing something that ron could not but that had been a reflection in a mirror something much more insubstantial than a hundred very solidlooking beasts strong enough to pull a fleet of carriages if luna was to be believed the beasts had always been there but invisible why then could harry suddenly see them and why could ron notare you coming or what said ron beside himoh yeah said harry quickly and they joined the crowd hurrying up the stone steps into the castlethe entrance hall was ablaze with torches and echoing with footsteps as the students crossed the flagged stone floor for the double doors to the right leading to the great hall and the startofterm feastthe four long house tables in the great hall were filling up under the starless black ceiling which was just like the sky they could glimpse through the high windows candles floated in midair all along the tables illuminating the silvery ghosts who were dotted about the hall and the faces of the students talking eagerly exchanging summer news shouting greetings at friends from other houses eyeing one anothers new haircuts and robes again harry noticed people putting their heads together to whisper as he passed he gritted his teeth and tried to act as though he neither noticed nor caredluna drifted away from them at the ravenclaw table the moment they reached gryffindors ginny was hailed by some fellow fourthyears and left to sit with them harry ron hermione and neville found seats together about halfway down the table between nearly headless nick the gryffindor house ghost and parvati patil and lavender brown the last two of whom gave harry airy overlyfriendly greetings that made him quite sure they had stopped talking about him a split second before he had more important things to worry about however he was looking over the students heads to the staff table that ran along the top wall of the hallhes not thereron and hermione scanned the staff table too though there was no real need hagrids size made him instantly obvious in any lineuphe cant have left said ron sounding slightly anxiousof course he hasnt said harry firmlyyou dont think hes hurt or anything do you said hermione uneasilyno said harry at oncebut where is he thenthere was a pause then harry said very quietly so that neville parvati and lavender could not hear maybe hes not back yet you know from his mission the thing he was doing over the summer for dumbledoreyeah yeah thatll be it said ron sounding reassured but hermione bit her lip looking up and down the staff table as though hoping for some conclusive explanation of hagrids absencewhos that she said sharply pointing towards the middle of the staff tableharrys eyes followed hers they lit first upon professor dumbledore sitting in his highbacked golden chair at the centre of the long staff table wearing deeppurple robes scattered with silvery stars and a matching hat dumbledores head was inclined towards the woman sitting next to him who was talking into his ear she looked harry thought like somebodys maiden aunt squat with short curly mousebrown hair in which she had placed a horrible pink alice band that matched the fluffy pink cardigan she wore over her robes then she turned her face slightly to take a sip from her goblet and he saw with a shock of recognition a pallid toadlike face and a pair of prominent pouchy eyesits that umbridge womanwho said hermioneshe was at my hearing she works for fudgenice cardigan said ron smirkingshe works for fudge hermione repeated frowning what on earths she doing here thendunno hermione scanned the staff table her eyes narrowedno she muttered no surely not harry did not understand what she was talking about but did not ask his attention had been caught by professor grubblyplank who had just appeared behind the staff table she worked her way along to the very end and took the seat that ought to have been hagrids that meant the firstyears must have crossed the lake and reached the castle and sure enough a few seconds later the doors from the entrance hall opened a long line of scaredlooking firstyears entered led by professor mcgonagall who was carrying a stool on which sat an ancient wizards hat heavily patched and darned with a wide rip near the frayed brimthe buzz of talk in the great hall faded away the firstyears lined up in front of the staff table facing the rest of the students and professor mcgonagall placed the stool carefully in front of them then stood backthe firstyears faces glowed palely in the candlelight a small boy right in the middle of the row looked as though he was trembling harry recalled fleetingly how terrified he had felt when he had stood there waiting for the unknown test that would determine to which house he belongedthe whole school waited with bated breath then the rip near the hats brim opened wide like a mouth and the sorting hat burst into songin times of old when i was newand hogwarts barely startedthe founders of our noble schoolthought never to be partedunited by a common goalthey had the selfsame yearningto make the worlds best magic schooland pass along their learningtogether we will build and teachthe four good friends decidedand never did they dream that theymight some day be dividedfor were there such friends anywhereas slytherin and gryffindorunless it was the second pairof hufflepuff and ravenclawso how could it have gone so wronghow could such friendships failwhy i was there and so can tellthe whole sad sorry talesaid slytherin well teach just thosewhose ancestry is purestsaid ravenclaw well teach those whoseintelligence is surestsaid gryffindor well teach all thosewith brave deeds to their namesaid hufflepuff ill teach the lotand treat them just the samethese differences caused little strifewhen first they came to lightfor each of the four founders hada house in which they mighttake only those they wanted sofor instance slytherintook only pureblood wizardsof great cunning just like himand only those of sharpest mindwere taught by ravenclawwhile the bravest and the boldestwent to daring gryffindorgood hufflepuff she took the restand taught them all she knewthus the houses and their foundersretained friendships firm and trueso hogwarts worked in harmonyfor several happy yearsbut then discord crept among usfeeding on our faults and fearsthe houses that like pillars fourhad once held up our schoolnow turned upon each other anddivided sought to ruleand for a while it seemed the schoolmust meet an early endwhat with duelling and with fightingand the clash of friend on friendand at last there came c morningwhen old slytherin departedand though the fighting then died outhe left us quite downheartedand never since the founders fourwere whittled down to threehave the houses been unitedas they once were meant to beand now the sorting hat is hereand you all know the scorei sort you into housesbecause that is what im forbut this year ill go furtherlisten closely to my songthough condemned i am to split youstill i worry that its wrongthough i must fulfil my dutyand must quarter every yearstill i wonder whether sortingmay not bring the end i fearoh know the perils read the signsthe warning history showsfor our hogwarts is in dangerfrom external deadly foesand we must unite inside heror well crumble from withini have told you i have warned you let the sorting now beginthe hat became motionless once more applause broke out though it was punctured for the first time in harrys memory with muttering and whispers all across the great hall students were exchanging remarks with their neighbours and harry clapping along with everyone else knew exactly what they were talking aboutbranched out a bit this year hasnt it said ron his eyebrows raisedtoo right it has said harrythe sorting hat usually confined itself to describing the different qualities looked for by each of the four hogwarts houses and its own role in sorting them harry could not remember it ever trying to give the school advice beforei wonder if its ever given warnings before said hermione sounding slightly anxiousyes indeed said nearly headless nick knowledgeably leaning across neville towards her neville winced it was very uncomfortable to have a ghost lean through you the hat feels itself honourbound to give the school due warning whenever it feels but professor mcgonagall who was waiting to read out the list of firstyears names was giving the whispering students the sort of look that scorches nearly headless nick placed a seethrough finger to his lips and sat primly upright again as the muttering came to an abrupt end with a last frowning look that swept the lour house tables professor mcgonagall lowered her eyes to her long piece of parchment and called out the first nameabercrombie euanthe terrifiedlooking boy harry had noticed earlier stumbled forwards and put the hat on his head it was only prevented from falling right down to his shoulders by his very prominent ears the hat considered for a moment then the rip near the brim opened again and shoutedgryffindorharry clapped loudly with the rest of gryffindor house as euan abercrombie staggered to their table and sat down looking as though he would like very much to sink through the floor and never be looked at againslowly the long line of firstyears thinned in the pauses between the names and the sorting hats decisions harry could hear rons stomach rumbling loudly finally zeller rose was sorted into hufflepuff and professor mcgonagall picked up the hat and stool and marched them away as professor dumbledore rose to his feetwhatever his recent bitter feelings had been towards his headmaster harry was somehow soothed to see dumbledore standing before them all between the absence of hagrid and the presence of those dragonish horses he had felt that his return to hogwarts so long anticipated was full of unexpected surprises like jarring notes in a familiar song but this at least was how it was supposed to be their headmaster rising to greet them all before the startofterm feastto our newcomers said dumbledore in a ringing voice his arms stretched wide and a beaming smile on his lips welcome to our old hands welcome back there is a time for speechmaking but this is not it tuck inthere was an appreciative laugh and an outbreak of applause as dumbledore sat down neatly and threw his long beard over his shoulder so as to keep it out of the way of his plate for food had appeared out of nowhere so that the five long tables were groaning under joints and pies and dishes of vegetables bread and sauces and flagons of pumpkin juiceexcellent said ron with a kind of groan of longing and he seized the nearest plate of chops and began piling them on to his plate watched wistfully by nearly headless nickwhat were you saying before the sorting hermione asked the ghost about the hat giving warningsoh yes said nick who seemed glad of a reason to turn away from ron who was now eating roast potatoes with almost indecent enthusiasm yes i have heard the hat give several warnings before always at times when it detects periods of great danger for the school and always of course its advice is the same stand together be strong from withinow kunnit nofe skusin danger ifzat said ronhis mouth was so full harry thought it was quite an achievement for him to make any noise at alli beg your pardon said nearly headless nick politely while hermione looked revolted ron gave an enormous swallow and said how can it know if the schools in danger if its a hati have no idea said nearly headless nick of course it lives in dumbledores office so i daresay it picks things up thereand it wants all the houses to be friends said harry looking over at the slytherin table where draco malfoy was holding court fat chancewell now you shouldnt take that attitude said nick reprovingly peaceful cooperation thats the key we ghosts though we belong to separate houses maintain links of friendship in spite of the competitiveness between gryffindor and slytherin i would never dream of seeking an argument with the bloody barononly because youre terrified of him said ronnearly headless nick looked highly affrontedterrified i hope i sir nicholas de mimsyporpington have never been guilty of cowardice in my life the noble blood that runs in my veins what blood asked ron surely you havent still got its a figure of speech said nearly headless nick now so annoyed his head was trembling ominously on his partially severed neck i assume i am still allowed to enjoy the use of whichever words i like even if the pleasures of eating and drinking are denied me but i am quite used to students poking fun at my death i assure younick he wasnt really laughing at you said hermione throwing a furious look at ronunfortunately rons mouth was packed to exploding point again and all he could manage was node iddum eentup sechew which nick did not seem to think constituted an adequate apology rising into the air he straightened his feathered hat and swept away from them to the other end of the table coming to rest between the creevey brothers colin and denniswell done ron snapped hermionewhat said ron indignantly having managed finally to swallow his food tin not allowed to ask a simple questionoh forget it said hermione irritably and the pair of them spent the rest of the meal in huffy silenceharry was too used to their bickering to bother trying to reconcile them he felt it was a better use of his time to eat his way steadily through his steak and kidney pie then a large plateful of his favourite treacle tartwhen all the students had finished eating and the noise level in the hall was starting to creep upwards again dumbledore got to his feet once more talking ceased immediately as all turned to face the headmaster harry was feeling pleasantly drowsy now his fourposter bed was waiting somewhere above wonderfully warm and soft well now that we are all digesting another magnificent feast i beg a few moments of your attention for the usual startofterm notices said dumbledore firstyears ought to know that the forest in the grounds is outofbounds to students and a few of our older students ought to know by now too harry ron and hermione exchanged smirksmr filch the caretaker has asked me for what he tells me is the fourhundredandsixtysecond time to remind you all that magic is not permitted in corridors between classes nor are a number of other things all of which can be checked on the extensive list now fastened to mr filchs office doorwe have had two changes in staffing this year we are very pleased to welcome back professor grubblyplank who will be taking care of magical creatures lessons we are also delighted to introduce professor umbridge our new defence against the dark arts teacherthere was a round of polite but fairly unenthusiastic applause during which harry ron and hermione exchanged slightly panicked looks dumbledore had not said for how long grubblyplank would be teachingdumbledore continued tryouts for the house quidditch teams will take place on the he broke off looking enquiringly at professor umbridge as she was not much taller standing than sitting there was a moment when nobody understood why dumbledore had stopped talking but then professor umbridge cleared her throat hem hem and it became clear that she had got to her feet and was intending to make a speechdumbledore only looked taken aback for a moment then he sat down smartly and looked alertly at professor umbridge as though he desired nothing better than to listen to her talk other members of staff were not as adept at hiding their surprise professor sprouts eyebrows had disappeared into her flyaway hair and professor mcgonagalls mouth was as thin as harry had ever seen it no new teacher had ever interrupted dumbledore before many of the students were smirking this woman obviously did not know how things were done at hogwartsthank you headmaster professor umbridge simpered for those kind words of welcomeher voice was highpitched breathy and littlegirlish and again harry felt a powerful rush of dislike that he could not explain to himself all he knew was that he loathed everything about her from her stupid voice to her fluffy pink cardigan she gave another little throatclearing cough hem hem and continuedwell it is lovely to be back at hogwarts i must say she smiled revealing very pointed teeth and to see such happy little faces looking up at meharry glanced around none of the faces he could see looked happy on the contrary they all looked rather takenaback at being addressed as though they were five years oldi am very much looking forward to getting to know you all and im sure well be very good friendsstudents exchanged looks at this some of them were barely concealing grinsill be her friend as long as i dont have to borrow that cardigan parvati whispered to lavender and both of them lapsed into silent gigglesprofessor umbridge cleared her throat again hem hem but when she continued some of the breathiness had vanished from her voice she sounded much more businesslike and now her words had a dull learnedbyheart sound to themthe ministry of magic has always considered the education of young witches and wizards to be of vital importance the rare gifts with which you were born may come to nothing if not nurtured and honed by careful instruction the ancient skills unique to the wizarding community must be passed down the generations lest we lose them for ever the treasure trove of magical knowledge amassed by our ancestors must be guarded replenished and polished by those who have been called to the noble profession of teachingprofessor umbridge paused here and made a little bow to her fellow staff members none of whom bowed back to her professor mcgonagalls dark eyebrows had contracted so that she looked positively hawklike and harry distinctly saw her exchange a significant glance with professor sprout as umbridge gave another little hem hem and went on with her speechevery headmaster and headmistress of hogwarts has brought something new to the weighty task of governing this historic school and that is as it should be for without progress there will be stagnation and decay there again progress for progresss sake must be discouraged for our tried and tested traditions often require no tinkering a balance then between old and new between permanence and change between tradition and innovation harry found his attentiveness ebbing as though his brain was slipping in and out of tune the quiet that always filled the hall when dumbledore was speaking was breaking up as students put t heir heads together whispering and giggling over on the ravenclaw table cho chang was chatting animatedly with her friends a few seats along from cho luna lovegood had got out the quibbler again meanwhile at the hufflepuff table ernie macmillan was one of the few still staring at professor umbridge but he was glassyeyed and harry was sure he was only pretending to listen in an attempt to live up to the new prefects badge gleaming on his chestprofessor umbridge did not seem to notice the restlessness of her audience harry had the impression that a fullscale riot could have broken out under her nose and she would have ploughed on with her speech the teachers however were still listening very attentively and hermione seemed to be drinking in every word umbridge spoke though judging by her expression they were not at all to her tastebecause some changes will be for the better while others will come in the fullness of time to be recognised as errors of judgement meanwhile some old habits will be retained and rightly so whereas others outmoded and outworn must be abandoned let us move forward then into a new era of openness effectiveness and accountability intent on preserving what ought to be preserved perfecting what needs to be perfected and pruning wherever we find practices that ought to be prohibitedshe sat down dumbledore clapped the staff followed his lead though harry noticed that several of them brought their hands together only once or twice before stopping a few students joined in but most had been taken unawares by the end of the speech not having listened to more than a few words of it and before they could start applauding properly dumbledore had stood up againthank you very much professor umbridge that was most illuminating he said bowing to her now as i was saying quidditch tryouts will be held yes it certainly was illuminating said hermione in a low voiceyoure not telling me you enjoyed it ron said quietly turning a glazed face towards hermione that was about the dullest speech ive ever heard and i grew up with percyi said illuminating not enjoyable said hermione it explained a lotdid it said harry in surprise sounded like a load of waffle to methere was some important stuff hidden in the waffle said hermione grimlywas there said ron blanklyhow about progress for progresss sake must be discouraged how about pruning wherever we find practices that ought to be prohibitedwell what does that mean said ron impatientlyill tell you what it means said hermione through gritted teeth it means the ministrys interfering at hogwartsthere was a great clattering and banging all around them dumbledore had obviously just dismissed the school because everyone was standing up ready to leave the hall hermione jumped up looking flusteredron were supposed to show the firstyears where to gooh yeah said ron who had obviously forgotten hey hey you lot midgetsronwell they are theyre titchy i know but you cant call them midgets firstyears hermione called commandingly along the table this way pleasea group of new students walked shyly up the gap between the gryffindor and hufflepuff tables all of them trying hard not to lead the group they did indeed seem very small harry was sure he had not appeared that young when he had arrived here he grinned at them a blond boy next to euan abercrombie looked petrified he nudged euan and whispered something in his ear euan abercrombie looked equally frightened and stole a horrified look at harry who felt the grin slide off his face like stinksapsee you later he said dully to ron and hermione and he made his way out of the great hall alone doing everything he could to ignore more whispering staring and pointing as he passed he kept his eyes fixed ahead as he wove his way through the crowd in the entrance hall then he hurried up the marble staircase took a couple of concealed short cuts and had soon left most of the crowds behindhe had been stupid not to expect this he thought angrily as he walked through the much emptier upstairs corridors of course everyone was staring at him he had emerged from the triwizard maze two months previously clutching the dead body of a fellow student and claiming to have seen lord voldemort return to power there had not been time last term to explain himself before theyd all had to go home even if he had felt up to giving the whole school a detailed account of the terrible events in that graveyardharry had reached the end of the corridor to the gryffindor common room and come to a halt in front of the portrait of the fat lady before he realised that he did not know the new passworder he said glumly staring up at the fat lady who smoothed the folds of her pink satin dress and looked sternly back at himno password no entrance she said loftilyharry i know it someone panted up behind him and he turned to see neville jogging towards him guess what it is im actually going to be able to remember it for once he waved the stunted little cactus he had shown them on the train mimbuius mimbletoniacorrect said the fat lady and her portrait swung open towards them like a door revealing a circular hole in the wall behind through which harry and neville now climbedthe gryffindor common room looked as welcoming as ever a cosy circular tower room full of dilapidated squashy armchairs and rickety old tables a fire was crackling merrily in the grate and a few people were warming their hands by it before going up to their dormitories on the other side of the room fred and george weasley were pinning something up on the noticeboard harry waved goodnight to them and headed straight for the door to the boys dormitories he was not in much of a mood for talking at the moment neville followed himdean thomas and seamus finnigan had reached the dormitory first and were in the process of covering the walls beside their beds with posters and photographs they had been talking as harry pushed open the door but stopped abruptly the moment they saw him harry wondered whether they had been talking about him then whether he was being paranoidhi he said moving across to his own trunk and opening ithey harry said dean who was putting on a pair of pyjamas in the west ham colours good holidaynot bad muttered harry as a true account of his holiday would have taken most of the night to relate and he could not face it youyeah it was ok chuckled dean better than seamuss anyway he was just telling mewhy what happened seamus neville asked as he placed his mimbuius mimbletonia tenderly on his bedside cabinetseamus did not answer immediately he was making rather a meal of ensuring that his poster of the kenmare kestrels quidditch team was quite straight then he said with his back still turned to harry me mam didnt want me to come backwhat said harry pausing in the act of pulling off his robesshe didnt want me to come back to hogwartsseamus turned away from his poster and pulled his own pyjamas out of his trunk still not looking at harrybut why said harry astonished he knew that seamuss mother was a witch and could not understand therefore why she should have come over so dursleyishseamus did not answer until he had finished buttoning his pyjamaswell he said in a measured voice i suppose because of youwhat dyou mean said harry quicklyhis heart was beating rather fast he felt vaguely as though something was closing in on himwell said seamus again still avoiding harrys eye she er well its not just you its dumbledore too she believes the daily prophet said harry she thinks im a liar and dumbledores an old foolseamus looked up at himyeah something like thatharry said nothing he threw his wand down on to his bedside table pulled off his robes stuffed them angrily into his trunk and pulled on his pyjamas he was sick of it sick of being the person who is stared at and talked about all the time if any of them knew if any of them had the faintest idea what it felt like to be the one all these things had happened to mrs finnigan had no idea the stupid woman he thought savagelyhe got into bed and made to pull the hangings closed around him but before he could do so seamus said look what did happen that night when you know when with cedric diggory and allseamus sounded nervous and eager at the same time dean who had been bending over his trunk trying to retrieve a slipper went oddly still and harry knew he was listening hardwhat are you asking me for harry retorted just read the daily prophet like your mother why dont you thatll tell you all you need to knowdont you have a go at my mother seamus snappedill have a go at anyone who calls me a liar said harrydont talk to me like thatill talk to you how i want said harry his temper rising so fast he snatched his wand back from his bedside table if youve got a problem sharing a dormitory with me go and ask mcgonagall if you can be moved stop your mummy worrying leave my mother out of this potterwhats going onron had appeared in the doorway his wide eyes travelled from harry who was kneeling on his bed with his wand pointing at seamus to seamus who was standing there with his fists raisedhes having a go at my mother seamus yelledwhat said ron harry wouldnt do that we met your mother we liked her thats before she started believing every word the stinking daily prophet writes about me said harry at the top of his voiceoh said ron comprehension dawning across his freckled face oh rightyou know what said seamus heatedly casting harry a venomous look hes right i dont want to share a dormitory with him any more hes madthats out of order seamus said ron whose ears were starting to glow red always a danger signout of order am i shouted seamus who in contrast with ron was going pale you believe all the rubbish hes come out with about youknowwho do you you reckon hes telling the truthyeah i do said ron angrilythen youre mad too said seamus in disgustyeah well unfortunately for you pal im also a prefect said ron jabbing himself in the chest with a finger so unless you want detention watch your mouthseamus looked for a few seconds as though detention would be a reasonable price to pay to say what was going through his mind but with a noise of contempt he turned on his heel vaulted into bed and pulled the hangings shut with such violence that they were ripped from the bed and fell in a dusty pile to the floor ron glared at seamus then looked at dean and neville
