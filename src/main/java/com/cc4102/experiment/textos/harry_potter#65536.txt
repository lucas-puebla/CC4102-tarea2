harry potter and the sorcerers stonechapter onethe boy who livedmr and mrs dursley of number four privet drive were proud to say that they were perfectly normal thank you very much they were the last people youd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious because they just didnt hold with such nonsensemr dursley was the director of a firm called grunnings which made drills he was a big beefy man with hardly any neck although he did have a very large mustache mrs dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences spying on the neighbors the dursleys had a small son called dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywherethe dursleys had everything they wanted but they also had a secret and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it they didnt think they could bear it if anyone found out about the potters mrs potter was mrs dursleys sister but they hadnt met for several years in fact mrs dursley pretended she didnt have a sister because her sister and her goodfornothing husband were as undursleyish as it was possible to be the dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the potters arrived in the street the dursleys knew that the potters had a small son too but they had never even seen him this boy was another good reason for keeping the potters away they didnt want dudley mixing with a child like thatwhen mr and mrs dursley woke up on the dull gray tuesday our story starts there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country mr dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work and mrs dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming dudley into his high chairnone of them noticed a large tawny owl flutter past the windowat half past eight mr dursley picked up his briefcase pecked mrs dursley on the cheek and tried to kiss dudley goodbye but missed because dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls little tyke chortled mr dursley as he left the house he got into his car and backed out of number fours driveit was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar a cat reading a map for a second mr dursley didnt realize what he had seen then he jerked his head around to look again there was a tabby cat standing on the corner of privet drive but there wasnt a map in sight what could he have been thinking of it must have been a trick of the light mr dursley blinked and stared at the cat it stared back as mr dursley drove around the corner and up the road he watched the cat in his mirror it was now reading the sign that said privet drive no looking at the sign cats couldnt read maps or signs mr dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind as he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that daybut on the edge of town drills were driven out of his mind by something else as he sat in the usual morning traffic jam he couldnt help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about people in cloaks mr dursley couldnt bear people who dressed in funny clothes the getups you saw on young people he supposed this was some stupid new fashion he drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by they were whispering excitedly together mr dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them werent young at all why that man had to be older than he was and wearing an emeraldgreen cloak the nerve of him but then it struck mr dursley that this was probably some silly stunt these people were obviously collecting for somethingyes that would be it the traffic moved on and a few minutes later mr dursley arrived in the grunnings parking lot his mind back on drillsmr dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor if he hadnt he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning he didnt see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight though people down in the street did they pointed and gazed open mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime mr dursley however had a perfectly normal owlfree morning he yelled at five different people he made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more he was in a very good mood until lunchtime when he thought hed stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakeryhed forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the bakers he eyed them angrily as he passed he didnt know why but they made him uneasy this bunch were whispering excitedly too and he couldnt see a single collecting tin it was on his way back past them clutching a large doughnut in a bag that he caught a few words of what they were sayingthe potters thats right thats what i heard yes their son harrymr dursley stopped dead fear flooded him he looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them but thought better of ithe dashed back across the road hurried up to his office snapped at his secretary not to disturb him seized his telephone and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind he put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache thinking no he was being stupid potter wasnt such an unusual name he was sure there were lots of people called potter who had a son called harry come to think of it he wasnt even sure his nephew was called harry hed never even seen the boy it might have been harvey or harold there was no point in worrying mrs dursley she always got so upset at any mention of her sister he didnt blame her if hed had a sister like that but all the same those people in cloakshe found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five oclock he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the doorsorry he grunted as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell it was a few seconds before mr dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak he didnt seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground on the contrary his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare dont be sorry my dear sir for nothing could upset me today rejoice for youknowwho has gone at last even muggles like yourself should be celebrating this happy happy dayand the old man hugged mr dursley around the middle and walked offmr dursley stood rooted to the spot he had been hugged by a complete stranger he also thought he had been called a muggle whatever that was he was rattled he hurried to his car and set off for home hoping he was imagining things which he had never hoped before because he didnt approve of imaginationas he pulled into the driveway of number four the first thing he saw and it didnt improve his mood was the tabby cat hed spotted that morning it was now sitting on his garden wall he was sure it was the same one it had the same markings around its eyesshoo said mr dursley loudly the cat didnt move it just gave him a stern look was this normal cat behavior mr dursley wondered trying to pull himself together he let himself into the house he was still determined not to mention anything to his wifemrs dursley had had a nice normal day she told him over dinner all about mrs next doors problems with her daughter and how dudley had learned a new word wont mr dursley tried to act normally when dudley had been put to bed he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news and finally birdwatchers everywhere have reported that the nations owls have been behaving very unusually today although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern the newscaster allowed himself a grinmost mysterious and now over to jim mcguffin with the weather going to be any more showers of owls tonight jimwell ted said the weatherman i dont know about that but its not only the owls that have been acting oddly today viewers as far apart as kent yorkshire and dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain i promised yesterday theyve had a downpour of shooting stars perhaps people have been celebrating bonfire night early its not until next week folks but i can promise a wet night tonightmr dursley sat frozen in his armchair shooting stars all over britain owls flying by daylight mysterious people in cloaks all over the place and a whisper a whisper about the pottersmrs dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea it was no good hed have to say something to her he cleared his throat nervously er petunia dear you havent heard from your sister lately have youas he had expected mrs dursley looked shocked and angry after all they normally pretended she didnt have a sisterno she said sharply whyfunny stuff on the news mr dursley mumbled owls shooting stars and there were a lot of funnylooking people in town todayso snapped mrs dursleywell i just thought maybe it was something to do with you know her crowdmrs dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips mr dursley wondered whether he dared tell her hed heard the name potter he decided he didnt dare instead he said as casually as he could their son hed be about dudleys age now wouldnt hei suppose so said mrs dursley stifflywhats his name again howard isnt itharry nasty common name if you ask meoh yes said mr dursley his heart sinking horribly yes i quite agreehe didnt say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bedwhile mrs dursley was in the bathroom mr dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden the cat was still thereit was staring down privet drive as though it were waiting for somethingwas he imagining things could all this have anything to do with the potters if it did if it got out that they were related to a pair of well he didnt think he could bear itthe dursleys got into bed mrs dursley fell asleep quickly but mr dursley lay awake turning it all over in his mind his last comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the potters were involved there was no reason for them to come near him and mrs dursley the potters knew very well what he and petunia thought about them and their kind he couldnt see how he and petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on he yawned and turned over it couldnt affect themhow very wrong he wasmr dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness it was sitting as still as a statue its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of privet drive it didnt so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street nor when two owls swooped overhead in fact it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at alla man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching appeared so suddenly and silently youd have thought hed just popped out of the ground the cats tail twitched and its eyes narrowednothing like this man had ever been seen on privet drive he was tall thin and very old judging by the silver of his hair and beard which were both long enough to tuck into his belt he was wearing long robes a purple cloak that swept the ground and highheeled buckled bootshis blue eyes were light bright and sparkling behind halfmoon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked as though it had been broken at least twice this mans name was albus dumbledorealbus dumbledore didnt seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome he was busy rummaging in his cloak looking for something but he did seem to realize he was being watched because he looked up suddenly at the cat which was still staring at him from the other end of the street for some reason the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him he chuckled and muttered i should have knownhe found what he was looking for in his inside pocket it seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter he flicked it open held it up in the air and clicked it the nearest street lamp went out with a little pop he clicked it again the next lamp flickered into darkness twelve times he clicked the putouter until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance which were the eyes of the cat watching him if anyone looked out of their window now even beadyeyed mrs dursley they wouldnt be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement dumbledore slipped the putouter back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four where he sat down on the wall next to the cat he didnt look at it but after a moment he spoke to itfancy seeing you here professor mcgonagallhe turned to smile at the tabby but it had gone instead he was smiling at a rather severelooking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes she too was wearing a cloak an emerald one her black hair was drawn into a tight bun she looked distinctly ruffledhow did you know it was me she askedmy dear professor i ve never seen a cat sit so stifflyyoud be stiff if youd been sitting on a brick wall all day said professor mcgonagallall day when you could have been celebrating i must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way hereprofessor mcgonagall sniffed angrilyoh yes everyones celebrating all right she said impatientlyyoud think theyd be a bit more careful but no even the muggles have noticed somethings going on it was on their news she jerked her head back at the dursleys dark livingroom window i heard it flocks of owls shooting stars well theyre not completely stupid they were bound to notice something shooting stars down in kent ill bet that was dedalus diggle he never had much senseyou cant blame them said dumbledore gently weve had precious little to celebrate for eleven yearsi know that said professor mcgonagall irritably but thats no reason to lose our heads people are being downright careless out on the streets in broad daylight not even dressed in muggle clothes swapping rumorsshe threw a sharp sideways glance at dumbledore here as though hoping he was going to tell her something but he didnt so she went on a fine thing it would be if on the very day youknowwho seems to have disappeared at last the muggles found out about us all i suppose he really has gone dumbledoreit certainly seems so said dumbledore we have much to be thankful for would you care for a lemon dropa whata lemon drop theyre a kind of muggle sweet im rather fond ofno thank you said professor mcgonagall coldly as though she didnt think this was the moment for lemon drops as i say even if youknowwho has gone my dear professor surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name all this you knowwho nonsense for eleven years i have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name voldemort professor mcgonagall flinched but dumbledore who was unsticking two lemon drops seemed not to notice it all gets so confusing if we keep saying youknowwho i have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying voldemorts namei know you haven t said professor mcgonagall sounding half exasperated half admiring but youre different everyone knows youre the only one youknow oh all right voldemort was frightened ofyou flatter me said dumbledore calmly voldemort had powers i will never haveonly because youre too well noble to use themits lucky its dark i havent blushed so much since madam pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffsprofessor mcgonagall shot a sharp look at dumbledore and said the owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around you know what everyones saying about why hes disappeared about what finally stopped himit seemed that professor mcgonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss the real reason she had been waiting on a cold hard wall all day for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now it was plain that whatever everyone was saying she was not going to believe it until dumbledore told her it was true dumbledore however was choosing another lemon drop and did not answerwhat theyre saying she pressed on is that last night voldemort turned up in godrics hollow he went to find the potters the rumor is that lily and james potter are are that theyre dead Ã¢â‚¬Å“dumbledore bowed his head professor mcgonagall gaspedlily and james i cant believe it i didnt want to believe itoh albusdumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder i know i know he said heavilyprofessor mcgonagalls voice trembled as she went on thats not alltheyre saying he tried to kill the potters son harry but he couldnt he couldnt kill that little boy no one knows why or how but theyre saying that when he couldnt kill harry potter voldemorts power somehow broke and thats why hes gonedumbledore nodded glumlyits its true faltered professor mcgonagall after all hes done all the people hes killed he couldnt kill a little boy its just astounding of all the things to stop him but how in the name of heaven did harry survivewe can only guess said dumbledore we may never knowprofessor mcgonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it it was a very odd watchit had twelve hands but no numbers instead little planets were moving around the edge it must have made sense to dumbledore though because he put it back in his pocket and said hagrids late i suppose it was he who told you id be here by the wayyes said professor mcgonagall and i dont suppose youre going to tell me why youre here of all placesive come to bring harry to his aunt and uncle theyre the only family he has left nowyou dont mean you cant mean the people who live here cried professor mcgonagall jumping to her feet and pointing at number fourdumbledore you cant ive been watching them all day you couldnt find two people who are less like us and theyve got this son i saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street screaming for sweetsharry potter come and live hereits the best place for him said dumbledore firmly his aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when hes older ive written them a lettera letter repeated professor mcgonagall faintly sitting back down on the wall really dumbledore you think you can explain all this in a letter these people will never understand him hell be famous a legend i wouldnt be surprised if today was known as harry potter day in the future there will be books written about harry every child in our world will know his nameexactly said dumbledore looking very seriously over the top of his halfmoon glasses it would be enough to turn any boys head famous before he can walk and talk famous for something he wont even remember cara you see how much better off hell be growing up away from all that until hes ready to take itprofessor mcgonagall opened her mouth changed her mind swallowed and then said yes yes youre right of course but how is the boy getting here dumbledore she eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding harry underneath ithagrids bringing himyou think it wise to trust hagrid with something as important as thisi would trust hagrid with my life said dumbledoreim not saying his heart isnt in the right place said professor mcgonagall grudgingly but you cant pretend hes not careless he does tend to what was thata low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them it grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of themif the motorcycle was huge it was nothing to the man sitting astride it he was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide he looked simply too big to be allowed and so wild long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face he had hands the size of trash can lids and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins in his vast muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blanketshagrid said dumbledore sounding relieved at last and where did you get that motorcycleborrowed it professor dumbledore sit said the giant climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke young sirius black lent it to me ive got him sirno problems were thereno sir house was almost destroyed but i got him out all right before the muggles started swarmin around he fell asleep as we was flyin over bristoldumbledore and professor mcgonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets inside just visible was a baby boy fast asleep under a tuft of jetblack hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut like a bolt of lightningis that where whispered professor mcgonagallyes said dumbledore hell have that scar forevercouldnt you do something about it dumbledoreeven if i could i wouldnt scars can come in handy i have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the london underground well give him here hagrid wed better get this over withdumbledore took harry in his arms and turned toward the dursleys housecould i could i say goodbye to him sir asked hagrid he bent his great shaggy head over harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy whiskery kiss then suddenly hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dogshhh hissed professor mcgonagall youll wake the mugglessssorry sobbed hagrid taking out a large spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it but i cccant stand it lily an james dead an poor little harry off ter live with muggles yes yes its all very sad but get a grip on yourself hagrid or well be found professor mcgonagall whispered patting hagrid gingerly on the arm as dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door he laid harry gently on the doorstep took a letter out of his cloak tucked it inside harrys blankets and then came back to the other two for a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle hagrids shoulders shook professor mcgonagall blinked furiously and the twinkling light that usually shone from dumbledores eyes seemed to have gone outwell said dumbledore finally thats that weve no business staying here we may as well go and join the celebrationsyeah said hagrid in a very muffled voice ill be takin sirius his bike back gnight professor mcgonagall professor dumbledore sirwiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life with a roar it rose into the air and off into the nighti shall see you soon i expect professor mcgonagall said dumbledore nodding to her professor mcgonagall blew her nose in replydumbledore turned and walked back down the street on the corner he stopped and took out the silver putouter he clicked it once and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that privet drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street he could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number fourgood luck harry he murmured he turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak he was gonea breeze ruffled the neat hedges of privet drive which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen harry potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up one small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on not knowing he was special not knowing he was famous not knowing he would be woken in a few hours time by mrs dursleys scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin dudley he couldnt know that at this very moment people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices to harry potter the boy who livedchapter twothe vanishing glassnearly ten years had passed since the dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step but privet drive had hardly changed at all the sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the dursleys front door it crept into their living room which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when mr dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passedten years ago there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing differentcolored bonnets but dudley dursley was no longer a baby and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle on a carousel at the fair playing a computer game with his father being hugged and kissed by his motherthe room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house tooyet harry potter was still there asleep at the moment but not for long his aunt petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the dayup get up nowharry woke with a start his aunt rapped on the door againup she screeched harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove he rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having it had been a good one there had been a flying motorcycle in it he had a funny feeling hed had the same dream beforehis aunt was back outside the doorare you up yet she demandednearly said harrywell get a move on i want you to look after the bacon and dont you dare let it burn i want everything perfect on duddys birthdayharry groanedwhat did you say his aunt snapped through the doornothing nothingdudleys birthday how could he have forgotten harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks he found a pair under his bed and after pulling a spider off one of them put them on harry was used to spiders because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them and that was where he sleptwhen he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen the table was almost hidden beneath all dudleys birthday presents it looked as though dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted not to mention the second television and the racing bike exactly why dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to harry as dudley was very fat and hated exercise unless of course it involved punching somebody dudleys favorite punching bag was harry but he couldnt often catch him harry didnt look it but he was very fastperhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard but harry had always been small and skinny for his age he looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of dudleys and dudley was about four times bigger than he was harry had a thin face knobbly knees black hair and bright green eyes he wore round glasses held together with a lot of scotch tape because of all the times dudley had punched him on the nose the only thing harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning he had had it as long as he could remember and the first question he could ever remember asking his aunt petunia was how he had gotten itin the car crash when your parents died she had said and dont ask questionsdont ask questions that was the first rule for a quiet life with the dursleysuncle vernon entered the kitchen as harry was turning over the baconcomb your hair he barked by way of a morning greetingabout once a week uncle vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that harry needed a haircut harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together but it made no difference his hair simply grew that way all over the placeharry was frying eggs by the time dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother dudley looked a lot like uncle vernon he had a large pink face not much neck small watery blue eyes and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick fat head aunt petunia often said that dudley looked like a baby angel harry often said that dudley looked like a pig in a wigharry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table which was difficult as there wasnt much room dudley meanwhile was counting his presentshis face fellthirtysix he said looking up at his mother and father thats two less than last yeardarling you havent counted auntie marges present see its here under this big one from mommy and daddyall right thirtyseven then said dudley going red in the faceharry who could see a huge dudley tantrum coming on began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case dudley turned the table overaunt petunia obviously scented danger too because she said quickly and well buy you another two presents while were out today hows that popkin two more presents is that all right dudley thought for a moment it looked like hard work finally he said slowly so ill have thirty thirtythirtynine sweetums said aunt petuniaoh dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel all right thenuncle vernon chuckled little tyke wants his moneys worth just like his father atta boy dudley he ruffled dudleys hairat that moment the telephone rang and aunt petunia went to answer it while harry and uncle vernon watched dudley unwrap the racing bike a video camera a remote control airplane sixteen new computer games and a vcr he was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when aunt petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worriedbad news vernon she said mrs figgs broken her leg she cant take him she jerked her head in harrys directiondudleys mouth fell open in horror but harrys heart gave a leap every year on dudleys birthday his parents took him and a friend out for the day to adventure parks hamburger restaurants or the movies every year harry was left behind with mrs figg a mad old lady who lived two streets away harry hated it there the whole house smelled of cabbage and mrs figg made him look at photographs of all the cats shed ever ownednow what said aunt petunia looking furiously at harry as though hed planned this harry knew he ought to feel sorry that mrs figg had broken her leg but it wasnt easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at tibbles snowy mr paws and tufty againwe could phone marge uncle vernon suggesteddont be silly vernon she hates the boythe dursleys often spoke about harry like this as though he wasnt there or rather as though he was something very nasty that couldnt understand them like a slugwhat about whatshername your friend yvonneon vacation in majorca snapped aunt petuniayou could just leave me here harry put in hopefully hed be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on dudleys computeraunt petunia looked as though shed just swallowed a lemonand come back and find the house in ruins she snarledi wont blow up the house said harry but they werent listeningi suppose we could take him to the zoo said aunt petunia slowly and leave him in the carthat cars new hes not sitting in it alonedudley began to cry loudly in fact he wasnt really crying it had been years since hed really cried but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed his mother would give him anything he wanteddinky duddydums dont cry mummy wont let him spoil your special day she cried flinging her arms around himi dont want him ttto come dudley yelled between huge pretend sobs he always sp spoils everything he shot harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mothers armsjust then the doorbell rang oh good lord theyre here said aunt petunia frantically and a moment later dudleys best friend piers polkiss walked in with his mother piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat he was usually the one who held peoples arms behind their backs while dudley hit them dudley stopped pretending to cry at oncehalf an hour later harry who couldnt believe his luck was sitting in the back of the dursleys car with piers and dudley on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life his aunt and uncle hadnt been able to think of anything else to do with him but before theyd left uncle vernon had taken harry asideim warning you he had said putting his large purple face right up close to harrys im warning you now boy any funny business anything at all and youll be in that cupboard from now until christmasim not going to do anything said harry honestlybut uncle vernon didnt believe him no one ever didthe problem was strange things often happened around harry and it was just no good telling the dursleys he didnt make them happenonce aunt petunia tired of harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadnt been at all had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs which she left to hide that horrible scar dudley had laughed himself silly at harry who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glassesnext morning however he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before aunt petunia had sheared it off he had been given a week in his cupboard for this even though he had tried to explain that he couldnt explain how it had grown back so quicklyanother time aunt petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of dudleys brown with orange puff balls the harder she tried to pull it over his head the smaller it seemed to become until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet but certainly wouldnt fit harry aunt petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and to his great relief harry wasnt punishedon the other hand hed gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens dudleys gang had been chasing him as usual when as much to harrys surprise as anyone elses there he was sitting on the chimney the dursleys had received a very angry letter from harrys headmistress telling them harry had been climbing school buildings but all hed tried to do as he shouted at uncle vernon through the locked door of his cupboard was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid jumpbut today nothing was going to go wrong it was even worth being with dudley and piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasnt school his cupboard or mrs figgs cabbagesmelling living roomwhile he drove uncle vernon complained to aunt petunia he liked to complain about things people at work harry the council harry the bank and harry were just a few of his favorite subjects this morning it was motorcyclesroaring along like maniacs the young hoodlums he said as a motorcycle overtook themi had a dream about a motorcycle said harry remembering suddenly it was flyinguncle vernon nearly crashed into the car in front he turned right around in his seat and yelled at harry his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache motorcycles dont flydudley and piers sniggeredi know they dont said harry it was only a dreambut he wished he hadnt said anything if there was one thing the dursleys hated even more than his asking questions it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldnt no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideasit was a very sunny saturday and the zoo was crowded with families the dursleys bought dudley and piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then because the smiling lady in the van had asked harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop it wasnt bad either harry thought licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like dudley except that it wasnt blondharry had the best morning hed had in a long time he was careful to walk a little way apart from the dursleys so that dudley and piers who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime wouldnt fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him they ate in the zoo restaurant and when dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didnt have enough ice cream on top uncle vernon bought him another one and harry was allowed to finish the firstharry felt afterward that he should have known it was all too good to lastafter lunch they went to the reptile house it was cool and dark in there with lit windows all along the walls behind the glass all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone dudley and piers wanted to see huge poisonous cobras and thick mancrushing pythons dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place it could have wrapped its body twice around uncle vernons car and crushed it into a trash can but at the moment it didnt look in the mood in fact it was fast asleepdudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass staring at the glistening brown coilsmake it move he whined at his father uncle vernon tapped on the glass but the snake didnt budgedo it again dudley ordered uncle vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles but the snake just snoozed onthis is boring dudley moaned he shuffled awayharry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake he wouldnt have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long it was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom where the only visitor was aunt petunia hammering on the door to wake you up at least he got to visit the rest of the housethe snake suddenly opened its beady eyes slowly very slowly it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with harrysit winkedharry stared then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching they werent he looked back at the snake and winked toothe snake jerked its head toward uncle vernon and dudley then raised its eyes to the ceiling it gave harry a look that said quite plainly i get that all the timei know harry murmured through the glass though he wasnt sure the snake could hear him it must be really annoyingthe snake nodded vigorouslywhere do you come from anyway harry askedthe snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass harry peered at itboa constrictor brazilwas it nice therethe boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and harry read on this specimen was bred in the zoo oh i see so youve never been to brazilas the snake shook its head a deafening shout behind harry made both of them jumpdudley mr dursley come and look at this snake you wont believe what its doingdudley came waddling toward them as fast as he couldout of the way you he said punching harry in the ribs caught by surprise harry fell hard on the concrete floor what came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened one second piers and dudley were leaning right up close to the glass the next they had leapt back with howls of horrorharry sat up and gasped the glass front of the boa constrictors tank had vanished the great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly slithering out onto the floor people throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exitsas the snake slid swiftly past him harry could have sworn a low hissing voice said brazil here i come thanksss amigothe keeper of the reptile house was in shockbut the glass he kept saying where did the glass gothe zoo director himself made aunt petunia a cup of strong sweet tea while he apologized over and over again piers and dudley could only gibber as far as harry had seen the snake hadnt done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed but by the time they were all back in uncle vernons car dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg while piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death but worst of all for harry at least was piers calming down enough to say harry was talking to it werent you harryuncle vernon waited until piers was safely out of the house before starting on harry he was so angry he could hardly speak he managed to say go cupboard stay no meals before he collapsed into a chair and aunt petunia had to run and get him a large brandyharry lay in his dark cupboard much later wishing he had a watch he didnt know what time it was and he couldnt be sure the dursleys were asleep yet until they were he couldnt risk sneaking to the kitchen for some foodhed lived with the dursleys almost ten years ten miserable years as long as he could remember ever since hed been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash he couldnt remember being in the car when his parents had died sometimes when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard he came up with a strange vision a blinding flash of green light and a burn ing pain on his forehead this he supposed was the crash though he couldnt imagine where all the green light came from he couldnt remember his parents at all his aunt and uncle never spoke about them and of course he was forbidden to ask questions there were no photographs of them in the housewhen he had been younger harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away but it had never happened the dursleys were his only family yet sometimes he thought or maybe hoped that strangers in the street seemed to know him very strange strangers they were too a tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with aunt petunia and dudley after asking harry furiously if he knew the man aunt petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything a wildlooking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus a bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word the weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second harry tried to get a closer lookat school harry had no one everybody knew that dudleys gang hated that odd harry potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses and nobody liked to disagree with dudleys gangchapter threethe letters from no onethe escape of the brazilian boa constrictor earned harry his longestever punishment by the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again the summer holidays had started and dudley had already broken his new video camera crashed his remote control airplane and first time out on his racing bike knocked down old mrs figg as she crossed privet drive on her crutchesharry was glad school was over but there was no escaping dudleys gang who visited the house every single day piers dennis malcolm and gordon were all big and stupid but as dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot he was the leader the rest of them were all quite happy to join in dudleys favorite sport harry huntingthis was why harry spent as much time as possible out of the house wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays where he could see a tiny ray of hope when september came he would be going off to secondary school and for the first time in his life he wouldnt be with dudley dudley had been accepted at uncle vernons old private school smeltings piers polkiss was going there too harry on the other hand was going to stonewall high the local public school dudley thought this was very funnythey stuff peoples heads down the toilet the first day at stonewallhe told harry want to come upstairs and practiceno thanks said harry the poor toilets never had anything as horrible as your head down it it might be sick then he ran before dudley could work out what hed saidone day in july aunt petunia took dudley to london to buy his smeltings uniform leaving harry at mrs figgs mrs figg wasn t as bad as usual it turned out shed broken her leg tripping over one of her cats and she didnt seem quite as fond of them as before she let harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though shed had it for several yearsthat evening dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brandnew uniform smeltings boys wore maroon tailcoats orange knickerbockers and flat straw hats called boaters they also carried knobbly sticks used for hitting each other while the teachers werent looking this was supposed to be good training for later lifeas he looked at dudley in his new knickerbockers uncle vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life aunt petunia burst into tears and said she couldnt believe it was her ickle dudleykins he looked so handsome and grownup harry didnt trust himself to speak he thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laughthere was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when harry went in for breakfast it seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink he went to have a look the tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray waterwhats this he asked aunt petunia her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a questionyour new school uniform she saidharry looked in the bowl againoh he said i didnt realize it had to be so wetdota be stupid snapped aunt petunia im dyeing some of dudleys old things gray for you itll look just like everyone elses when ive finishedharry seriously doubted this but thought it best not to argue he sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at stonewall high like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin probablydudley and uncle vernon came in both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from harrys new uniform uncle vernon opened his newspaper as usual and dudley banged his smelting stick which he carried everywhere on the tablethey heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormatget the mail dudley said uncle vernon from behind his papermake harry get itget the mail harrymake dudley get itpoke him with your smelting stick dudleyharry dodged the smelting stick and went to get the mail three things lay on the doormat a postcard from uncle vernons sister marge who was vacationing on the isle of wight a brown envelope that looked like a bill and a letter for harryharry picked it up and stared at it his heart twanging like a giant elastic band no one ever in his whole life had written to him who would he had no friends no other relatives he didnt belong to the library so hed never even got rude notes asking for books back yet here it was a letter addressed so plainly there could be no mistake mr h potter the cupboard under the stairs privet drive little whinging surrey the envelope was thick and heavy made of yellowish parchment and the address was written in emeraldgreen ink there was no stampturning the envelope over his hand trembling harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms a lion an eagle a badger and a snake surrounding a large letter hhurry up boy shouted uncle vernon from the kitchen what are you doing checking for letter bombs he chuckled at his own jokeharry went back to the kitchen still staring at his letter he handed uncle vernon the bill and the postcard sat down and slowly began to open the yellow envelopeuncle vernon ripped open the bill snorted in disgust and flipped over the postcardmarges ill he informed aunt petunia ate a funny whelk dad said dudley suddenly dad harrys got somethingharry was on the point of unfolding his letter which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by uncle vernonthats mine said harry trying to snatch it backwhod be writing to you sneered uncle vernon shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it his face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights and it didnt stop there within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridgepppetunia he gaspeddudley tried to grab the letter to read it but uncle vernon held it high out of his reach aunt petunia took it curiously and read the first line for a moment it looked as though she might faint she clutched her throat and made a choking noisevernon oh my goodness vernonthey stared at each other seeming to have forgotten that harry and dudley were still in the room dudley wasnt used to being ignored he gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his smelting sticki want to read that letter he said loudly want to read it said harry furiously as its mineget out both of you croaked uncle vernon stuffing the letter back inside its envelopeharry didnt movei want my letter he shoutedlet me see it demanded dudleyout roared uncle vernon and he took both harry and dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall slamming the kitchen door behind them harry and dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole dudley won so harry his glasses dangling from one ear lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floorvernon aunt petunia was saying in a quivering voice look at the address how could they possibly know where he sleeps you dont think theyre watching the housewatching spying might be following us muttered uncle vernon wildlybut what should we do vernon should we write back tell them we dont want harry could see uncle vernons shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchenno he said finally no well ignore it if they dont get an answer yes thats best we wont do anythingbut im not having one in the house petunia didnt we swear when we took him in wed stamp out that dangerous nonsensethat evening when he got back from work uncle vernon did something hed never done before he visited harry in his cupboardwheres my letter said harry the moment uncle vernon had squeezed through the door whos writing to meno one it was addressed to you by mistake said uncle vernon shortlyi have burned itit was not a mistake said harry angrily it had my cupboard on itsilence yelled uncle vernon and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling he took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile which looked quite painfuler yes harry about this cupboard your aunt and i have been thinking youre really getting a bit big for it we think it might be nice if you moved into dudleys second bedroomwhy said harrydont ask questions snapped his uncle take this stuff upstairs nowthe dursleys house had four bedrooms one for uncle vernon and aunt petunia one for visitors usually uncle vernons sister marge one where dudley slept and one where dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldnt fit into his first bedroom it only took harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room he sat down on the bed and stared around him nearly everything in here was broken the monthold video camera was lying on top of a small working tank dudley had once driven over the next door neighbors dog in the corner was dudleys firstever television set which hed put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled there was a large birdcage which had once held a parrot that dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because dudley had sat on it other shelves were full of books they were the only things in the room that looked as though theyd never been touchedfrom downstairs came the sound of dudley bawling at his mother i dont want him in there i need that room make him get outharry sighed and stretched out on the bed yesterday hed have given anything to be up here today hed rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without itnext morning at breakfast everyone was rather quiet dudley was in shock hed screamed whacked his father with his smelting stick been sick on purpose kicked his mother and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof and he still didnt have his room back harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing hed opened the letter in the hall uncle vernon and aunt petunia kept looking at each other darklywhen the mail arrived uncle vernon who seemed to be trying to be nice to harry made dudley go and get it they heard him banging things with his smelting stick all the way down the hall then he shouted theres another one mr h potter the smallest bedroom privet drive Ã¢â‚¬Å“with a strangled cry uncle vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall harry right behind him uncle vernon had to wrestle dudley to the ground to get the letter from him which was made difficult by the fact that harry had grabbed uncle vernon around the neck from behind after a minute of confused fighting in which everyone got hit a lot by the smelting stick uncle vernon straightened up gasping for breath with harrys letter clutched in his handgo to your cupboard i mean your bedroom he wheezed at harrydudley go just goharry walked round and round his new room someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadnt received his first letter surely that meant theyd try again and this time hed make sure they didnt fail he had a planthe repaired alarm clock rang at six oclock the next morning harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently he mustnt wake the dursleys he stole downstairs without turning on any of the lightshe was going to wait for the postman on the corner of privet drive and get the letters for number four first his heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door harry leapt into the air hed trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat something alive lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror harry realized that the big squashy something had been his uncles face uncle vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag clearly making sure that harry didnt do exactly what hed been trying to do he shouted at harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back the mail had arrived right into uncle vernons lapharry could see three letters addressed in green inki want he began but uncle vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes uncle vernon didnt go to work that day he stayed at home and nailed up the mail slotsee he explained to aunt petunia through a mouthful of nails if they cant deliver them theyll just give upim not sure thatll work vernonoh these peoples minds work in strange ways petunia theyre not like you and me said uncle vernon trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake aunt petunia had just brought himon friday no less than twelve letters arrived for harry as they couldnt go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door slotted through the sides and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroomuncle vernon stayed at home again after burning all the letters he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out he hummed tiptoe through the tulipsas he worked and jumped at small noiseson saturday things began to get out of hand twentyfour letters to harry found their way into the house rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed aunt petunia through the living room window while uncle vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to aunt petunia shredded the letters in her food processorwho on earth wants to talk to you this badly dudley asked harry in amazementon sunday morning uncle vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill but happyno post on sundays he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers no damn letters today something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head next moment thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets the dursleys ducked but harry leapt into the air trying to catch oneout outuncle vernon seized harry around the waist and threw him into the hallwhen aunt petunia and dudley had run out with their arms over their faces uncle vernon slammed the door shut they could hear the letters still streaming into the room bouncing off the walls and floorthat does it said uncle vernon trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time i want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave were going away just pack some clothes no argumentshe looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boardedup doors and were in the car speeding toward the highwaydudley was sniffling in the back seat his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television vcr and computer in his sports bagthey drove and they drove even aunt petunia didnt dare ask where they were going every now and then uncle vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while shakeem off shake em off he would mutter whenever he did thisthey didnt stop to eat or drink all day by nightfall dudley was howling hed never had such a bad day in his life he was hungry hed missed five television programs hed wanted to see and hed never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computeruncle vernon stopped at last outside a gloomylooking hotel on the outskirts of a big city dudley and harry shared a room with twin beds and damp musty sheets dudley snored but harry stayed awake sitting on the windowsill staring down at the lights of passing cars and wonderingthey ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day they had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their tablescuse me but is one of you mr h potter only i got about an undred of these at the front deskshe held up a letter so they could read the green ink address mr h potter room railview hotel cokeworth harry made a grab for the letter but uncle vernon knocked his hand out of the way the woman staredill take them said uncle vernon standing up quickly and following her from the dining roomwouldnt it be better just to go home dear aunt petunia suggested timidly hours later but uncle vernon didnt seem to hear her exactly what he was looking for none of them knew he drove them into the middle of a forest got out looked around shook his head got back in the car and off they went again the same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field halfway across a suspension bridge and at the top of a multilevel parking garagedaddys gone mad hasnt he dudley asked aunt petunia dully late that afternoon uncle vernon had parked at the coast locked them all inside the car and disappearedit started to rain great drops beat on the roof of the car dud ley sniveledits monday he told his mother the great humbertos on tonight i want to stay somewhere with a television Ã¢â‚¬Å“monday this reminded harry of something if it was monday and you could usually count on dudley to know the days the week because of television then tomorrow tuesday was harrys eleventh birthday of course his birthdays were never exactly fun last year the dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of uncle vernons old socksstill you werent eleven every dayuncle vernon was back and he was smiling he was also carrying a long thin package and didnt answer aunt petunia when she asked what hed boughtfound the perfect place he said come on everyone outit was very cold outside the car uncle vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine one thing was certain there was no television in therestorm forecast for tonight said uncle vernon gleefully clapping his hands together and this gentlemans kindly agreed to lend us his boata toothless old man came ambling up to them pointing with a rather wicked grin at an old rowboat bobbing in the irongray water below themive already got us some rations said uncle vernon so all aboardit was freezing in the boat icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces after what seemed like hours they reached the rock where uncle vernon slipping and sliding led the way to the brokendown housethe inside was horrible it smelled strongly of seaweed the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls and the fireplace was damp and empty there were only two roomsuncle vernons rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas he tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled upcould do with some of those letters now eh he said cheerfullyhe was in a very good mood obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail harry privately agreed though the thought didnt cheer him up at allas night fell the promised storm blew up around them spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows aunt petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for dudley on the motheaten sofa she and uncle vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door and harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest most ragged blanketthe storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on harry couldnt sleep he shivered and turned over trying to get comfortable his stomach rumbling with hunger dudleys snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight the lighted dial of dudleys watch which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist told harry hed be eleven in ten minutes time he lay and watched his birthday tick nearer wondering if the dursleys would remember at all wondering where the letter writer was nowfive minutes to go harry heard something creak outside he hoped the roof wasnt going to fall in although he might be warmer if it didfour minutes to go maybe the house in privet drive would be so full of letters when they got back that hed be able to steal one somehowthree minutes to go was that the sea slapping hard on the rock like that and two minutes to go what was that funny crunching noise was the rock crumbling into the sea one minute to go and hed be eleven thirty seconds twenty tennine maybe hed wake dudley up just to annoy him three twooneboomthe whole shack shivered and harry sat bolt upright staring at the door someone was outside knocking to come inchapter fourthe keeper of the keysboom they knocked again dudley jerked awake wheres the cannon he said stupidlythere was a crash behind them and uncle vernon came skidding into the room he was holding a rifle in his hands now they knew what had been in the long thin package he had brought with themwhos there he shouted i warn you im armedthere was a pause then Ã¢â‚¬â€œsmashthe door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floora giant of a man was standing in the doorway his face was almost completely hidden by a long shaggy mane of hair and a wild tangled beard but you could make out his eyes glinting like black beetles under all the hairthe giant squeezed his way into the hut stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling he bent down picked up the door and fitted it easily back into its frame the noise of the storm outside dropped a little he turned to look at them allcouldnt make us a cup o tea could yeh its not been an easy journeyhe strode over to the sofa where dudley sat frozen with fearbudge up yeh great lump said the strangerdudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother who was crouching terrified behind uncle vernonan heres harry said the giantharry looked up into the fierce wild shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smilelas time i saw you you was only a baby said the giant yeh look a lot like yet dad but yehve got yet moms eyesuncle vernon made a funny rasping noisei demand that you leave at once sit he said you are breaking and enteringah shut up dursley yeh great prune said the giant he reached over the back of the sofa jerked the gun out of uncle vernons hands bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber and threw it into a corner of the roomuncle vernon made another funny noise like a mouse being trodden onanyway harry said the giant turning his back on the dursleys a very happy birthday to yeh got summat fer yeh here i mighta sat on it at some point but itll taste all rightfrom an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed box harry opened it with trembling fingers inside was a large sticky chocolate cake with happy birthday harry written on it in green icingharry looked up at the giant he meant to say thank you but the words got lost on the way to his mouth and what he said instead was who are youthe giant chuckledtrue i havent introduced meself rubeus hagrid keeper of keys and grounds at hogwartshe held out an enormous hand and shook harrys whole armwhat about that tea then eh he said rubbing his hands togetherid not say no ter summat stronger if yehve got it mindhis eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he snorted he bent down over the fireplace they couldnt see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later there was a roaring fire there it filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and harry felt the warmth wash over him as though hed sunk into a hot baththe giant sat back down on the sofa which sagged under his weight and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat a copper kettle a squashy package of sausages a poker a teapot several chipped mugs and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage nobody said a thing while the giant was working but as he slid the first six fat juicy slightly burnt sausages from the poker dudley fidgeted a little uncle vernon said sharply dont touch anything he gives you dudleythe giant chuckled darklyyet great puddin of a son don need fattenin anymore dursley don worryhe passed the sausages to harry who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful but he still couldnt take his eyes off the giant finally as nobody seemed about to explain anything he said im sorry but i still dont really know who you arethe giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his handcall me hagrid he said everyone does an like i told yeh im keeper of keys at hogwarts yehll know all about hogwarts o courseer no said harryhagrid looked shockedsorry harry said quicklysony barked

after a few minutes he stammered what does it mean they await my owlgallopin gorgons that reminds me said hagrid clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl a real live rather ruffledlooking owl a long quill and a roll of parchmentwith his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that harry could read upside down dear professor dumbledore given harry his lettertaking him to buy his things tomorrowweathers horrible hope youre wellhagrid hagrid rolled up the note gave it to the owl which clamped it in its beak went to the door and threw the owl out into the storm then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephoneharry realized his mouth was open and closed

an james potter its an outrage a scandal harry potter not knowin his own story when every kid in our world knows his name but why what happened harry asked urgentlythe anger faded from hagrids face he

some o the best witches an wizards of the age the mckinnons the bones the prewetts an you was only a baby an you livedsomething very painful was going on in harrys mind as hagrids story came to a close he saw again the blinding flash of green light more clearly than he had ever remembered it before and he remembered something else for the first time in his life a high cold cruel laughhagrid was watching him sadlytook yeh from the ruined house myself on dumbledores orders brought yeh ter this lotload of old tosh said uncle vernon harry jumped he had almost forgotten that the dursleys were there uncle vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage he was glaring at hagrid and his fists were clenchednow you listen here boy he snarled i accept theres something strange about you probably nothing a good beating wouldnt have cured and as for all this about your parents well they were weirdos no denying it and the worlds better off without them in my opinion asked for all they got getting mixed up with these wizarding types just what i expected always knew theyd come to a sticky end but at that moment hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat pointing this at uncle vernon like a sword he said im warning you dursley im warning you one more word Ã¢â‚¬Å“in danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant uncle vernons courage failed again he flattened himself against the wall and fell silentthats better said hagrid breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa which this time sagged right down to the floorharry meanwhile still had questions to ask hundreds of thembut what happened to vol sorry i mean youknowwhogood question harry disappeared vanished same night he tried ter kill you makes yeh even more famous thats the biggest mystry seehe was gettin more an more powerful whyd he go some say he died codswallop in my opinion dunno if he had enough human left in him to die some say hes still out there bidin his time like but i don believe it people who was on his side came back ter ours some of em came outta kinda trances don reckon they couldve done if he was comin backmost of us reckon hes still out there somewhere but lost his powerstoo weak to carry on cause somethin about you finished him harrythere was somethin goin on that night he hadnt counted on i dunno what it was no one does but somethin about you stumped him all righthagrid looked at harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes but harry instead of feeling pleased and proud felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake a wizard him how could he possibly be hed spent his life being clouted by dudley and bullied by aunt petunia and uncle vernon if he was really a wizard why hadnt they been turned into warty toads every time theyd tried to lock him in his cupboard if hed once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world how come dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football hagrid he said quietly i think you must have made a mistake i dont think i can be a wizardto his surprise hagrid chucklednot a wizard eh never made things happen when you was scared or angryharry looked into the fire now he came to think about it every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he harry had been upset or angry chased by dudleys gang he had somehow found himself out of their reach dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut hed managed to make it grow back and the very last time dudley had hit him hadnt he got his revenge without even realizing he was doing it hadnt he set a boa constrictor on him harry looked back at hagrid smiling and saw that hagrid was positively beaming at himsee said hagrid harry potter not a wizard you wait youll be right famous at hogwartsbut uncle vernon wasnt going to give in without a fighthavent i told you hes not going he hissed hes going to stonewall high and hell be grateful for it ive read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish spell books and wands and if he wants ter go a great muggle like you wont stop him growled hagrid stop lily an james potter s son goin ter hogwarts yer madhis

change an hell be under the greatest headmaster hogwarts ever had albus dumbledi am not paying for some crackpot old fool to teach him magic tricksyelled uncle vernonbut he had finally gone too far hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it over his head never he thundered insult albus dumbledorein front of mehe brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at dudley there was a flash of violet light a sound like a firecracker a sharp squeal and the next second dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom howling in pain when he turned his back on them harry saw a curly pigs tail poking through a hole in his trousersuncle vernon roared pulling aunt petunia and dudley into the other room he cast one last terrified look at hagrid and slammed the door behind themhagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beardshouldnta lost me temper he said ruefully but it didnt work anyway meant ter turn him into a pig but i suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there wasnt much left ter dohe cast a sideways look at harry under his bushy eyebrowsbe grateful if yeh didnt mention that ter anyone at hogwarts he said im er not supposed ter do

right harry mumbled im getting uphe sat up and hagrids heavy coat fell off him the hut was full of sunlight the storm was over hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window a newspaper held in its beakharry scrambled to his feet so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him he went straight to the window and jerked it open the owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of hagrid who didnt wake up the owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack hagrids coatdont do thatharry tried to wave the owl out of the way but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coathagrid said harry loudly theres an owl pay him hagrid grunted into the sofawhathe wants payin fer deliverin the paper look in the pocketshagrids coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets bunches of keys slug pellets balls of string peppermint humbugs teabagsfinally harry pulled out a handful of strangelooking coinsgive him five knuts said hagrid sleepilyknutsthe little bronze onesharry counted out five little bronze coins and the owl held out his leg so harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it then he flew off through the open windowhagrid yawned loudly sat up and stretchedbest be off harry lots ter do today gotta get up ter london an buy all yer stuff fer schoolharry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them he had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had got a punctureum hagridmm said hagrid who was pulling on his huge bootsi havent got any money and you heard uncle vernon last night he wont pay for me to go and learn magicdont worry about that said hagrid standing up and scratching his head dyeh think yer

thenharry followed hagrid out onto the rock the sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight the boat uncle vernon had hired was still there with a lot of water in the bottom after the stormhow did you get here harry asked looking around for another boatflew said hagridflewyeah but well go back in this not spposed ter use magic now ive got yehthey settled down in the boat harry still staring at hagrid trying to imagine him flyingseems a shame ter row though said hagrid giving harry another of his sideways looks if i was ter er speed things up a bit would yeh mind not mentionin it at hogwartsof course not said harry eager to see more magic hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again tapped it twice on the side of the boat and they sped off toward landwhy would you be

gringotts is hundreds of miles under london see deep under the underground yehd die of hunger tryin ter get out even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summatharry sat and thought about this while hagrid read his newspaper the daily prophet harry had learned from uncle vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this but it was very difficult hed never had so many questions in his lifeministry o magic messin things up as usual hagrid muttered turning the pagetheres a ministry of magic harry asked before he could stop himselfcourse said hagrid they wanted dumbledore fer minister course but hed never leave hogwarts so old cornelius fudge got the job bungler if ever there was one so he pelts dumbledore with owls every morning askin fer advicebut what does a ministry of magic dowell their main job is to keep it from the muggles that theres still witches an wizards up an down the countrywhywhy blimey harry everyoned be wantin magic solutions to their problems nah were best left aloneat this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall hagrid folded up his newspaper and they clambered up the stone steps onto the streetpassersby stared a lot at hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station harry couldnt blame them not only was hagrid twice as tall as anyone else he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly see that harry things these muggles dream up ehhagrid said harry panting a bit as he ran to keep up did you say there are dragons at gringottswell so they say said hagrid crikey id like a dragonyoud like onewanted one ever since i was a kid here we gothey had reached the station there was a train to london in five minutes time hagrid who didnt understand muggle money as he called it gave the bills to harry so he could buy their ticketspeople stared more than ever on the train hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canaryyellow circus tentstill got yer letter harry he asked as he counted stitches harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocketgood said hagrid theres a list there of everything yeh needharry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadnt noticed the night before and read hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry uniform firstyear students will require three sets of plain work robes black one plain pointed hat black for day wear one pair of protective

years are not allowed their own broomsticks can we buy all this in london harry wondered aloudif yeh know where to go said hagridharry had never been to london before although hagrid seemed to know where he was going he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way he got stuck in the ticket barrier on the underground and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slowi dont know how the muggles manage without magic he said as they climbed a brokendown escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shopshagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily all harry had to do was keep close behind him they passed book shops and music stores hamburger restaurants and cinemas but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand this was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks might this not all be some huge joke that the dursleys had cooked up if harry hadnt known that the dursleys had no sense of humor he might have thought so yet somehow even though everything hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable harry couldnt help trusting himthis is it said hagrid coming to a halt the leaky cauldron its a famous placeit was a tiny grubbylooking pub if hagrid hadnt pointed it out harry wouldnt have noticed it was there the people hurrying by didnt glance at it their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldnt see the leaky cauldron at all in fact harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and hagrid could see it before he could mention this hagrid had steered him insidefor a famous place it was very dark and shabby a few old women were sitting in a corner drinking tiny glasses of sherry one of them was smoking a long pipe a little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut the low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in everyone seemed to know hagrid they waved and smiled at him and the bartender reached for a glass saying the usual hagridcant tom im on hogwarts business said hagrid clapping his great hand on harrys shoulder and making harrys knees bucklegood lord said the bartender peering at harry is this can this be the leaky cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silentbless my soul whispered the old bartender harry potter what an honorhe hurried out from behind the bar rushed toward harry and seized his hand tears in his eyeswelcome back mr potter welcome backharry didnt know what to say everyone was looking at him the old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone outhagrid was beamingthen there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the leaky cauldrondoris crockford mr potter cant believe im meeting you at lastso proud mr potter im just so proudalways wanted to shake your hand im all of a flutterdelighted mr potter just cant tell you diggles the name dedalus diggleive seen you before said harry as dedalus diggles top

crockford kept coming back for morea pale young man made his way forward very nervously one of his eyes was twitchingprofessor quirrell said hagrid harry professor quirrell will be one of your teachers at hogwartspppotter stammered professor quirrell grasping harrys hand ccant ttell you how p pleased i am to meet youwhat sort of magic do you teach professor quirrellddefense against the

last hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babblemust get on lots ter buy come on harrydoris crockford shook harrys hand one last time and hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small walled courtyard where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weedshagrid grinned at harrytold yeh didnt i told yeh you was famous even professor quirrell was tremblin ter meet yeh mind you hes usually tremblinis he always that nervousoh yeah poor bloke brilliant mind he was fine while he was studyin outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience they say he met vampires in the black forest and there was a nasty bit o trouble with a hag never been the same sincescared of the students scared of his own subject now wheres me umbrellavampires hags harrys head was swimming hagrid meanwhile was counting bricks in the wall above the trash canthree up two across he muttered right stand back harryhe tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrellathe brick he had touched quivered it wriggled in the middle a small hole appeared it grew wider and wider a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for hagrid an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sightwelcome said hagrid to diagon alleyhe grinned at harrys amazement they stepped through the archway harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wallthe sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shopcauldrons all sizes copper brass pewter silver selfstirring collapsible said a sign hanging over themyeah youll be needin one said hagrid but we gotta get yer money firstharry wished he had about eight more eyes he turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street trying to look at everything at once the shops the things outside them the people doing their shopping a plump woman outside an apothecary was shaking her head as they passed saying dragon liver seventeen sickles an ounce theyre mada low soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying eeylops owl emporium tawny screech barn brown and snowy several boys of about harrys age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it look harry heard one of them say the new nimbus two thousand fastest ever there were shops selling robes shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments harry had never seen before windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels eyes tottering piles of spell books quills and rolls of parchment potion bottles globes of the moongringotts said hagridthey had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops standing beside its burnished bronze doors wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold was yeah thats a goblin said hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him the goblin was about a head shorter than harryhe had a swarthy clever face a pointed beard and harry noticed very long fingers and feet he bowed as they walked inside now they were facing a second pair of doors silver this time with words engraved upon them enter stranger but take heed of what awaits the sin of greed for those who take but do not earn must pay most dearly in their turnso if you seek beneath our floors a treasure that was never yours thief you have been warned beware of finding more than treasure therelike i said yehd be mad ter try an rob it said hagrida pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall about a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter scribbling in large ledgers weighing coins in brass scales examining precious stones through eyeglassesthere were too many doors to count leading off the hall and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these hagrid and harry made for the countermorning said hagrid to a free goblin weve come ter take some money outta mr harry potters safeyou have his key sirgot it here somewhere said hagrid and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblins book of numbers the goblin wrinkled his nose harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coalsgot it said hagrid at last holding up a tiny golden keythe goblin looked at it closelythat seems to be in orderan ive also got a letter here from professor dumbledore said hagrid importantly throwing out his chest its about the youknowwhat in vault seven hundred and thirteenthe goblin read the letter carefullyvery well he said handing it back to hagrid i will have someone take you down to both vaults griphookgriphook was yet another goblin once hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets he and harry followed griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hallwhats the youknowwhat in vault seven hundred and thirteen harry askedcant tell yeh that said hagrid mysteriously very secret hogwarts business dumbledores trusted me moren my jobs worth ter tell yeh thatgriphook held the door open for them harry who had expected more marble was surprised they were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches it sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them they climbed in hagrid with some difficulty and were offat first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages harry tried to remember left right right left middle fork right left but it was impossible the rattling cart seemed to know its own way because griphook wasnt steeringharrys eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them but he kept them wide open once he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon but too late they plunged even deeper passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floori never know harry called to hagrid over the noise of the cart whats the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactitestalagmites got an m in it said hagrid an don ask me questions just now i think im gonna be sickhe did look very green and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from tremblinggriphook unlocked the door a lot of green smoke came billowing out and as it cleared harry gasped inside were mounds of gold coins columns of silver heaps of little bronze knutsall yours smiled hagridall harrys it was incredible the dursleys couldnt have known about this or theyd have had it from him faster than blinking how often had they complained how much harry cost them to keep and all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him buried deep under londonhagrid helped harry pile some of it into a bagthe gold ones are galleons he explained seventeen silver sickles to a galleon and twentynine knuts to a sickle its easy enough right that should be enough fer a couple o terms well keep the rest safe for yeh he turned to griphook vault seven hundred and thirteen now please and can we go more slowlyone speed only said griphookthey were going even deeper now and gathering speed the air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners they went rattling over an underground ravine and harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom but hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neckvault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyholestand back said griphook importantly he stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted awayif anyone but a gringotts goblin tried that theyd be sucked through the door and trapped in there said griphookhow often do you check to see if anyones inside harry askedabout once every ten years said griphook with a rather nasty grinsomething really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault harry was sure and he leaned forward eagerly expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least but at first he thought it was empty then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat harry longed to know what it was but knew better than to askcome on back in this infernal cart and dont talk to me on the way back its best if i keep me mouth shut said hagridone wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside gringotts harry didnt know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money he didnt have to know how many galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than hed had in his whole life more money than even dudley had ever hadmight as well get yer uniform said hagrid nodding toward madam malkins robes for all occasions listen harry would yeh mind if i slipped off fer a pickmeup in the leaky cauldron i hate them gringotts carts he did still look a bit sick so harry entered madam malkins shop alone feeling nervousmadam malkin was a squat smiling witch dressed all in mauvehogwarts clear she said when harry started to speak got the lot here another young man being fitted up just now in fact Ã¢â‚¬Å“in the back of the shop a boy with a pale pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes madam malkin stood harry on a stool next to him slipped a long robe over his head and began to pin it to the right lengthhello said the boy hogwarts tooyes said harrymy fathers next door buying my books and mothers up the street looking at wands said the boy he had a bored drawling voice then im going to drag them off to took at racing brooms i dont see why first years cant have their own i think ill bully father into getting me one and ill smuggle it in somehowharry was strongly reminded of dudleyhave you got your own broom the boy went onno said harryplay quidditch at allno harry said again wondering what on earth quidditch could bei do father says its a crime if im not picked to play for my house and i must say i agree know what house youll be in yetno said harry feeling more stupid by the minutewell no one really knows until they get there do they but i know ill be in slytherin all our family have been imagine being in hufflepuff i think id leave wouldnt you mmm said harry wishing he could say something a bit more interestingi say look at that man said the boy suddenly nodding toward the front window hagrid was standing there grinning at harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldnt come inthats hagrid said harry pleased to know something the boy didnthe works at hogwartsoh said the boy ive heard of him hes a sort of servant isnt hehes the gamekeeper said harry he was liking the boy less and less every secondyes exactly i heard hes a sort of savage lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk tries to do magic and ends up setting fire to his bedi think hes brilliant said harry coldlydo you said the boy with a slight sneer why is he with you where are your parentstheyre dead said harry shortly he didnt feel much like going into the matter with this boyoh sorry said the other not sounding sorry at all but they were our kind werent theythey were a witch and wizard if thats what you meani really dont think they should let the other sort in do you theyre just not the same theyve never been brought up to know our ways some of them have never even heard of hogwarts until they get the letter imagine i think they should keep it in the old wizarding familieswhats your surname anywaybut before harry could answer madam malkin said thats you done my dear and harry not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy hopped down from the footstoolwell ill see you at hogwarts i suppose said the drawling boyharry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream hagrid had bought him chocolate and raspberry with chopped nutswhats up said hagridnothing harry lied they stopped to buy parchment and quills harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote when they had left the shop he said hagrid whats quidditchblimey harry i keep forgettin how little yeh know not knowin about quidditchdont make me feel worse said harry he told hagrid about the pate boy in madam malkinsand he said people from muggle families shouldnt even be allowed inyer not from a muggle family if hed known who yeh were hes grown up knowin yer name if his parents are wizardin folk you saw what everyone in the leaky cauldron was like when they saw yeh anyway what does he know about it some o the best i ever saw were the only ones with magic in em in a long line muggles look at yer mum look what she had fer a sisterso what is quidditchits our sport wizard sport its like like soccer in the muggle world everyone follows quidditch played up in the air on broomsticks and theres four balls sorta hard ter explain the rulesand what are slytherin and hufflepuffschool houses theres four everyone says hufflepuff are a lot o duffers but i bet im in hufflepuff said harry gloomilybetter hufflepuff than slytherin said hagrid darkly theres not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasnt in slytherinyouknowwho was onevol sorry youknowwho was at hogwartsyears an years ago said hagridthey bought harrys school books in a shop called flourish and blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all even dudley who never read anything would have been wild to get his hands on some of these hagrid almost had to drag harry away from curses and countercurses bewitch your friends and befuddle your enemies with the latest revenges hair loss jellylegs tongue tying and much much more by professor vindictus viridiani was trying to find out how to curse dudleyim not sayin thats not a good idea but yer not ter use magic in the muggle world except in very special circumstances said hagrid an anyway yeh couldn work any of them curses yet yehll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that levelhagrid wouldnt let harry buy a solid gold cauldron either it says pewter on yer list but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope then they visited the apothecary which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor jars of herbs dried roots and bright powders lined the walls bundles of feathers strings of fangs and snarled claws hung from the ceiling while hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for harry harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twentyone galleons each and minuscule glitteryblack beetle eyes five knuts a scoopoutside the apothecary hagrid checked harrys list againjust yer wand left a yeah an i still havent got yeh a birthday presentharry felt himself go redyou dont have to i know i dont have to tell yeh what ill get yer animal not a toad toads went outta fashion years ago yehd be laughed at an i don like cats they make me sneeze ill get yer an owl all the kids want owls theyre dead useful carry yer mail an everythintwenty minutes later they left eeylops owl emporium which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering jewelbright eyes harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl fast asleep with her head under her wing he couldnt stop stammering his thanks sounding just like professor quirrelldon mention it said hagrid gruffly don expect youve had a lotta presents from them dursleys just ollivanders left now only place fer wands ollivanders and yeh gotta have the best wanda magic wand this was what harry had been really looking forward tothe last shop was narrow and shabby peeling gold letters over the door read ollivanders makers of fine wands since bc a single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty windowa tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside it was a tiny place empty except for a single spindly chair that hagrid sat on to wait harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling for some reason the back of his neck prickled the very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magicgood afternoon said a soft voice harry jumped hagrid must have jumped too because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chairan old man was standing before them his wide pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shophello said harry awkwardlyah yes said the man yes yes i thought id be seeing you soonharry potter it wasnt a question you have your mothers eyes it seems only yesterday she was in here herself buying her first wand ten and a quarter inches long swishy made of willow nice wand for charm workmr ollivander moved closer to harry harry wished he would blink those silvery eyes were a bit creepyyour father on the other hand favored a mahogany wand eleven inchespliable a little more power and excellent for transfiguration well i say your father favored it its really the wand that chooses the wizard of coursemr ollivander had come so close that he and harry were almost nose to nose harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyesand thats wheremr ollivander touched the lightning scar on harrys forehead with a long white fingerim sorry to say i sold the wand that did it he said softlythirteenandahalf inches yew powerful wand very powerful and in the wrong hands well if id known what that wand was going out into the world to dohe shook his head and then to harrys relief spotted hagridrubeus rubeus hagrid how nice to see you again oak sixteen inches rather bendy wasnt itit was sir yes said hagridgood wand that one but i suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled said mr ollivander suddenly sterner yes they did yes said hagrid shuffling his feet ive still got the pieces though he added brightlybut you dont use them said mr ollivander sharplyoh no sit said hagrid quickly harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spokehmmm said mr ollivander giving hagrid a piercing look well now mr potter let me see he pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket which is your wand armer well im righthanded said harryhold out your arm thats it he measured harry from shoulder to finger then wrist to elbow shoulder to floor knee to armpit and round his head as he measured he said every ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance mr potter we use unicorn hairs phoenix tail feathers and the heartstrings of dragons no two ollivander wands are the same just as no two unicorns dragons or phoenixes are quite the same and of course you will never get such good results with another wizards wandharry suddenly realized that the tape measure which was measuring between his nostrils was doing this on its own mr ollivander was flitting around the shelves taking down boxesthat will do he said and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor right then mr potter try this one beechwood and dragon heartstring nine inches nice and flexible just take it and give it a waveharry took the wand and feeling foolish waved it around a bit but mr ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at oncemaple and phoenix feather

inches nice and suppleharry took the wand he felt a sudden warmth in his fingers he raised the wand above his head brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls hagrid whooped and clapped and mr ollivander cried oh bravo yes indeed oh very good well well well how curious how very curious Ã¢â‚¬Å“he put harrys wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper still muttering curious curioussorry said harry but whats curiousmr ollivander fixed harry with his pale starei

remember i think we must expect great things from you mr potter after all he whomustnotbenamed did great things terrible yes but greatharry shivered he wasnt sure he liked mr ollivander too much he paid seven gold galleons for his wand and mr ollivander bowed them from his shopthe late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as harry and hagrid made their way back down diagon alley back through the wall back through the leaky cauldron now empty harry didnt speak at all as they walked down the road he didnt even notice how much people were gawking at them on the underground laden as they were with all their funnyshaped packages with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on harrys lap up another escalator out into paddington station harry only realized where they were when hagrid tapped him on the shouldergot time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves he saidhe bought harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them harry kept looking around everything looked so strange somehowyou all right harry yer very quiet said hagridharry wasnt sure he could explain hed just had the best birthday of his life and yet he chewed his hamburger trying to find the wordseveryone

cant even remember what im famous for i dont know what happened when vol sorry i mean the night my parents diedhagrid leaned across the table behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smiledon you worry harry youll learn fast enough everyone starts at the beginning at hogwarts youll be just fine just be yerself i know its hard yehve been singled out an thats always hard but yehll have a great time at hogwarts i did still do smatter of facthagrid helped harry on to the train that would take him back to the dursleys then handed him an envelopeyer ticket fer hogwarts he said first o september kings cross its all on yer ticket any problems with the dursleys send me a letter with yer owl shell know where to find me see yeh soon harrythe train pulled out of the station harry wanted to watch hagrid until he was out of sight he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window but he blinked and hagrid had gonechapter sixthe journey from platform nine and threequartersharrys last month with the dursleys wasnt fun true dudley was now so scared of harry he wouldnt stay in the same room while aunt petunia and uncle vernon didnt shut harry in his cupboard force him to do anything or shout at him in fact they didnt speak to him at allhalf terrified half furious they acted as though any chair with harry in it were empty although this was an improvement in many ways it did become a bit depressing after a whileharry kept to his room with his new owl for company he had decided to call her hedwig a name he had found in a history of magic his school books were very interesting he lay on his bed reading late into the night hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased it was lucky that aunt petunia didnt come in to vacuum anymore because hedwig kept bringing back dead mice every night before he went to sleep harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall counting down to september the firston the last day of august he thought hed better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to kings cross station the next day so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television he cleared his throat to let them know he was there and dudley screamed and ran from the roomer uncle vernonuncle vernon grunted to show he was listeninger i need to be at kings cross tomorrow to to go to hogwartsuncle vernon grunted againwould it be all right if you gave me a liftgrunt harry supposed that meant yesthank youhe was about to go back upstairs when uncle vernon actually spokefunny way to get to a wizards school the train magic carpets all got punctures have theyharry didnt say anythingwhere is this school anywayi dont know said harry realizing this for the first time he pulled the ticket hagrid had given him out of his pocketi just take the train from platform nine and threequarters at eleven oclock he readhis aunt and uncle staredplatform whatnine and threequartersdont talk rubbish said uncle vernon there is no platform nine and threequartersits on my ticketbarking said uncle vernon howling mad the lot of them youll seeyou just wait all right well take you to kings cross were going up to london tomorrow anyway or i wouldnt botherwhy are you going to london harry asked trying to keep things friendlytaking dudley to the hospital growled uncle vernon got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to smeltingsharry woke at five oclock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep he got up and pulled on his jeans because he didnt want to walk into the station in his wizards robes hed change on the train he checked his hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed saw that hedwig was shut safely in her cage and then paced the room waiting for the dursleys to get up two hours later harrys huge heavy trunk had been loaded into the dursleys car aunt petunia had talked dudley into sitting next to harry and they had set offthey reached kings cross at half past ten uncle vernon dumped harrys trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him harry thought this was strangely kind until uncle vernon stopped dead facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his facewell there you are boy platform nine platform ten your platform should be somewhere in the middle but they dont seem to have built it yet do theyhe was quite right of course there was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it and in the middle nothing at allhave a good term said uncle vernon with an even nastier smile he left without another word harry turned and saw the dursleys drive awayall three of them were laughing harrys mouth went rather dry what on earth was he going to do he was starting to attract a lot of funny looks because of hedwig hed have to ask someonehe stopped a passing guard but didnt dare mention platform nine and threequarters the guard had never heard of hogwarts and when harry couldnt even tell him what part of the country it was in he started to get annoyed as though harry was being stupid on purpose getting desperate harry asked for the train that left at eleven oclock but the guard said there wasnt one in the end the guard strode away muttering about time wasters harry was now trying hard not to panicaccording to the large clock over the arrivals board he had ten minutes left to get on the train to hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift a pocket full of wizard money and a large owlhagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do like tapping the third brick on the left to get into diagon alley he wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspectors stand between platforms nine and tenat that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were sayingpacked with muggles of course harry swung round the speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys all with flaming red hair each of them was pushing a trunk like harrys in front of him and they had an owlheart hammering harry pushed his cart after them they stopped and so did he just near enough to hear what they were sayingnow whats the platform number said the boys mothernine and threequarters piped a small girl also redheaded who was holding her hand mom cant i go Ã¢â‚¬Å“youre not old enough ginny now be quiet all right percy you go firstwhat looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and tenharry watched careful not to blink in case he missed it but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away the boy had vanishedfred you next the plump woman saidim not fred im george said the boy honestly woman you call yourself our mother cara you tell im georgesorry george dearonly joking i am fred said the boy and off he went his twin called after him to hurry up and he must have done so because a second later he had gone but how had he done it now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was almost there and then quite suddenly he wasnt anywherethere was nothing else for itexcuse me harry said to the plump womanhello dear she said first time at hogwarts rons new tooshe pointed at the last and youngest of her sons he was tall thin and gangling with freckles big hands and feet and a long noseyes said harry the thing is the thing is i dont know how to how to get onto the platform she said kindly and harry noddednot to worry she said all you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten dont stop and dont be scared youll crash into it thats very important best do it at a bit of a run if youre nervous go on go now before roner okay said harryhe pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier it looked very solidhe started to walk toward it people jostled him on their way to platforms nine and ten harry walked more quickly he was going to smash right into that barrier and then hed be in trouble leaning forward on his cart he broke into a heavy run the barrier was coming nearer and nearer he wouldnt be able to stop the cart was out of control he was a foot away he closed his eyes ready for the crash it didnt come he kept on running he opened his eyes a scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people a sign overhead said hogwarts express eleven oclock harry looked behind him and saw a wroughtiron archway where the barrier had been with the words platform nine and threequarters on it he had done itsmoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunksthe first few carriages were already packed with students some hanging out of the window to talk to their families some fighting over seatsharry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seathe passed a roundfaced boy who was saying gran ive lost my toad againoh neville he heard the old woman sigha boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowdgive us a look lee go onthe boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long hairy legharry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train he put hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door he tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his footwant a hand it was one of the redhaired twins hed followed through the barrieryes please harry pantedoy fred cmere and helpwith the twins

saw the boys mother waving and their sister half laughing half crying running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed then she fell back and wavedharry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner houses flashed past the window harry felt a great leap of excitement he didnt know what he was going to but it had to be better than what he was leaving behindthe door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came inanyone sitting there he asked pointing at the seat opposite harryeverywhere else is fullharry shook his head and the boy sat down he glanced at harry and then looked quickly out of the window pretending he hadnt looked harry saw he still had a black mark on his nosehey ronthe twins were backlisten were going

doing he looked quickly out of the window againare all your family wizards asked harry who found ron just as interesting as ron found himer yes i think so said ron i think moms got a second cousin whos an accountant but we never talk about himso you must know loads of magic alreadythe weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in diagon alley had talked abouti heard

rat which was asleephis names scabbers and hes useless he hardly ever wakes up percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect but they couldnt aff i mean i got scabbers insteadrons ears went pink he seemed to think hed said too much because he went back to staring out of the windowharry didnt think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl after all hed never had any money in his life until a month ago and he told ron so all about having to wear dudleys old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents this seemed to cheer ron upand until hagrid told me i didnt know anything about be ing a wizard or about my parents or voldemortron gaspedwhat said harryyou said youknowwhos name said ron sounding both shocked and impressed id have thought you of all people im not trying to be brave or anything saying the name said harry i just never knew you shouldnt see what i mean ive got loads to learn i bet he added voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot lately i bet im the worst in the classyou wont be theres loads of people who come from muggle families and they learn quick enoughwhile they had been talking the train had carried them out of londonnow they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep they were quiet for a time watching the fields and lanes flick pastaround half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling dimpled woman slid back their door and said anything off the cart dearsharry who hadnt had any breakfast leapt to his feet but rons ears went pink again and he muttered that hed brought sandwiches harry went out into the corridorhe had never had any money for candy with the dursleys and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many mars bars as he could carry but the woman didnt have mars bars what she did have were bettie botts every flavor beans droobles best blowing gum chocolate frogs pumpkin pasties cauldron cakes licorice wands and a number of other strange things harry had never seen in his life not wanting to miss anything he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver sickles and seven bronze knutsron stared as harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seathungry are youstarving said harry taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pastyron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it there were four sandwiches inside he pulled one of them apart and said she always forgets i dont like corned beefswap you for one of these said harry holding up a pasty go on you dont want this its all dry said ron she hasnt got much time he added quickly you know with five of usgo on have a pasty said harry who had never had anything to share before or indeed anyone to share it with it was a nice feeling sitting there with ron eating their way through all harrys pasties cakes and candies the sandwiches lay forgottenwhat are these harry asked ron holding up a pack of chocolate frogstheyre not really frogs are they he was starting to feel that nothing would surprise himno said ron but see what the card is im missing agrippawhatoh of course you wouldnt know chocolate frogs have cards inside them you know to collect famous witches and wizards ive got about five hundred but i havent got agrippa or ptolemyharry unwrapped his chocolate frog and picked up the card it showed a mans face he wore half moon glasses had a long crooked nose and flowing silver hair beard and mustache underneath the picture was the name albus dumbledoreso this is dumbledore said harrydont tell me youd never heard of dumbledore said ron can i have a frog i might get agrippa thanks harry turned over his card and read albus dumbledore currently headmaster of hogwarts considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard grindelwald in for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragons blood and his work on alchemy with his partner nicolas flamel professor dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowlingharry turned the card back over and saw to his astonishment that dumbledores face had disappearedhes gonewell you cant expect him to hang around all day said ron hell be back no ive got morgana again and ive got about six of her do you want it you can start collectingrons eyes strayed to the pile of chocolate frogs waiting to be unwrappedhelp yourself said harry but in you know the muggle world people just stay put in photosdo they what they dont move at all ron sounded amazed weirdharry stared as dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the famous witches and wizards cards but harry couldnt keep his eyes off them soon he had not only dumbledore and morgana but hengist of woodcroft alberic grunnion circe paracelsus and merlinhe finally tore his eyes away from the druidess cliodna who was scratching her nose to open a bag of bertie botts every flavor beansyou want to be careful with those ron warned harry when they say every flavor they mean every flavor you know you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and mar malade but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe george reckons he had a boogerflavored one onceron picked up a green bean looked at it carefully and bit into a cornerbleaaargh see sproutsthey had a good time eating the every flavor beans harry got toast coconut baked bean strawberry curry grass coffee sardine and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one ron wouldnt touch which turned out to be pepperthe countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder the neat fields had gone now there were woods twisting rivers and dark green hillsthere was a knock on the door of their compartment and the roundfaced boy harry had passed on platform nine and threequarters came in he looked tearfulsorry he said but have you seen a toad at allwhen they shook their heads he wailed ive lost him he keeps getting away from mehell turn up said harryyes said the boy miserably well if you see himhe leftdont know why hes so bothered said ron if id brought a toad id lose it as quick as i could mind you i brought scabbers so i cant talkthe rat was still snoozing on rons laphe might have died and you wouldnt know the difference said ron in disgust i tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting but the spell didnt work ill show you lookhe rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very batteredlooking wand it was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the endunicorn hairs nearly poking out anyway he had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open againthe toadless boy was back but this time he had a girl with him she was already wearing her new hogwarts robeshas anyone seen a toad nevilles lost one she said she had a bossy sort of voice lots of bushy brown hair and rather large front teethweve already told him we havent seen it said ron but the girl wasnt listening she was looking at the wand in his handoh are you doing magic lets see it thenshe sat down ron looked taken abacker all righthe cleared his throatsunshine daisies butter mellow turn this stupid fat rat yellowhe waved his wand but nothing happened scabbers stayed gray and fast asleepare you sure thats a real spell said the girl well its not very good is it ive tried a few simple spells just for practice and its all worked for me nobody in my familys magic at all it was ever such a surprise when i got my letter but i was ever so pleased of course i mean its the very best school of witchcraft there is ive heard ive learned all our course books by heart of course i just hope it will be enough im hermione granger by the way who are youshe said all this very fastharry looked at ron and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadnt learned all the course books by heart eitherim ron weasley ron mutteredharry potter said harryare you really said hermione i know all about you of course i got a few extra books for background reading and youre in modern magical history and the rise and fall of the dark arts and great wizarding events of the twentieth centuryam i said harry feeling dazedgoodness didnt you know id have found out everything i could if it was me said hermione do either of you know what house youll be in ive been asking around and i hope im in gryffindor it sounds by far the best i hear dumbledore himself was in it but i suppose ravenclaw wouldnt be too bad anyway wed better go and look for nevilles toad you two had better change you know i expect well be there soonand she left taking the toadless boy with herwhatever house im in i hope shes not in it said ron he threw his wand back into his trunk stupid spell george gave it to me bet he knew it was a dudwhat house are your brothers in asked harrygryffindor said ron gloom seemed to be settling on him again mom and dad were in it too i dont know what theyll say if im not i dont suppose ravenclaw would be too bad but imagine if they put me in slytherinthats the house vol i mean youknowwho was inyeah said ron he flopped back into his seat looking depressedyou know i think the ends of scabbers whiskers are a bit lightersaid harry trying to take rons mind off houses so what do your oldest brothers do now that theyve left anywayharry was wondering what a wizard did once hed finished schoolcharlies in romania studying dragons and bills in africa doing something for gringotts said ron did you hear about gringotts its been all over the daily prophet but i dont suppose you get that with the muggles someone tried to rob a high security vaultharry staredreally what happened to themnothing thats why its such big news they havent been caught my dad says it mustve been a powerful dark wizard to get round gringotts but they dont think they took anything thats whats odd course everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case youknowwhos behind itharry turned this news over in his mind he was starting to get a prickle of fear every time you knowwho was mentioned he supposed this was all part of entering the magical world but it had been a lot more comfortable saying voldemort without worryingwhats your quidditch team ron askeder i dont know any harry confessedwhat ron looked dumbfounded oh you wait its the best game in the world and he was off explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players describing famous games hed been to with his brothers and the broomstick hed like to get if he had the money he was just taking harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again but it wasnt neville the toadless boy or hermione granger this timethree boys entered and harry recognized the middle one at once it was the pale boy from madam malkins robe shop he was looking at harry with a lot more interest than hed shown back in diagon alleyis it true he said theyre saying all down the train that harry potters in this compartment so its you is ityes said harry he was looking at the other boys both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean standing on either side of the pale boy they looked like bodyguardsoh this is crabbe and this is goyle said the pale boy carelessly noticing where harry was looking and my names malfoy draco malfoyron gave a slight cough which might have been hiding a snigget draco malfoy looked at himthink my names funny do you no need to ask who you are my father told me all the weasleys have red hair freckles and more children than they can affordhe turned back to harry youll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others potter you dont want to go making friends with the wrong sort i can help you therehe held out his hand to shake harrys but harry didnt take iti think i can tell who the wrong sort are for myself thanks he said coollydraco malfoy didnt go red but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeksid be careful if i were you potter he said slowly unless youre a bit politer youll go the same way as your parents they didnt know what was good for them either you hang around with riffraff like the weasleys and that hagrid and itll rub off on youboth harry and ron stood upsay that again ron said his face as red as his hairoh youre going to fight us are you malfoy sneeredunless you get out now said harry more bravely than he felt because crabbe and goyle were a lot bigger than him or ronbut we dont feet like leaving do we boys weve eaten all our food and you still seem to have somegoyle reached toward the chocolate frogs next to ron ron leapt forward but before hed so much as touched goyle goyle let out a horrible yellscabbers the rat was hanging off his finger sharp little teeth sunk deep into goyles knuckle crabbe and malfoy backed away as goyle swung scabbers round and round howling and when scabbets finally flew off and hit the window all three of them disappeared at once perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets or perhaps theyd heard footsteps because a second later hermione granger had come inwhat has been going on she said looking at the sweets all over the floor and ron picking up scabbers by his taili think hes been knocked out ron said to harry he looked closer at scabbers no i dont believe it hes gone back to sleepand so he hadyouve met malfoy beforeharry explained about their meeting in diagon alleyive heard of his family said ron darkly they were some of the first to come back to our side after youknowwho disappeared said theyd been bewitched my dad doesnt believe it he says malfoys father didnt need an excuse to go over to the dark side he turned to hermione can we help you with somethingyoud better hurry up and put your robes on ive just been up to the front to ask the conductor and he says were nearly there you havent been fighting have you youll be in trouble before we even get therescabbers has been fighting not us said ron scowling at her would you mind leaving while we changeall right i only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly racing up and down the corridors said hermione in a sniffy voice and youve got dirt on your nose by the way did you knowron glared at her as she left harry peered out of the window it was getting dark he could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky the train did seem to be slowing downhe and ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robesrons were a bit short for him you could see his sneakers underneath thema voice echoed through the train we will be reaching hogwarts in five minutes time please leave your luggage on the train it will be taken to the school separatelyharrys stomach lurched with nerves and ron he saw looked pale under his freckles they crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridorthe train slowed right down and finally stopped people pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny dark platform harry shivered in the cold night air then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students and harry heard a familiar voice firs years firs years over here all right there harryhagrids big hairy face beamed over the sea of headscmon follow me any more firs years mind yer step now firs years follow meslipping and stumbling they followed hagrid down what seemed to be a steep narrow path it was so dark on either side of them that harry thought there must be thick trees there nobody spoke much neville the boy who kept losing his toad sniffed once or twiceye all get yer firs sight o hogwarts in a sec hagrid called over his shoulder jus round this bend herethere was a loud ooooohthe narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black takeperched atop a high mountain on the other side its windows sparkling in the starry sky was a vast castle with many turrets and towersno moren four to a boat hagrid called pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore harry and ron were followed into their boat by neville and hermione everyone in shouted hagrid who had a boat to himself right then forwardand the fleet of little boats moved off all at once gliding across the lake which was as smooth as glass everyone was silent staring up at the great castle overhead it towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stoodheads down yelled hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face they were carried along a dark tunnel which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle until they reached a kind of underground harbor where they clambered out onto rocks and pebblesoy you there is this your toad said hagrid who was checking the boats as people climbed out of themtrevor cried neville blissfully holding out his hands then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after hagrids lamp coming out at last onto smooth damp grass right in the shadow of the castlethey walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge oak front dooreveryone here you there still got yer toadhagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle doorchapter seventhe sorting hatthe door swung open at once a tall blackhaired witch in emeraldgreen robes stood there she had a very stern face and harrys first thought was that this was not someone to crossthe firs years professor mcgonagall said hagridthank you hagrid i will take them from hereshe pulled the door wide the entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the dursleys house in it the stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at gringotts the ceiling was too high to make out and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floorsthey followed professor mcgonagall across the flagged stone floor harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right the rest of the school must already be here but professor mcgonagall showed the first years into a small empty chamber off the hall they crowded in standing rather closer together than they would usually have done peering about nervouslywelcome to hogwarts said professor mcgonagall the startofterm banquet will begin shortly but before you take your seats in the great hall you will be sorted into your houses the sorting is a very important ceremony because while you are here your house will be something like your family within hogwarts you will have classes with the rest of your house sleep in your house dormitory and spend free time in your house common roomthe four houses are called gryffindor hufflepuff ravenclaw and slytherin each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards while you are at hogwarts your triumphs will earn your house points while any rulebreaking will lose house points at the end of the year the house with the most points is awarded the house cup a great honor i hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yoursthe sorting ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school i suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waitingher eyes lingered for a moment on nevilles cloak which was fastened under his left ear and on rons smudged nose harry nervously tried to flatten his hairi shall return when we are ready for you said professor mcgonagallplease wait quietlyshe left the chamber harry swallowedhow exactly do they sort us into houses he asked ronsome sort of test i think fred said it hurts a lot but i think he was jokingharrys heart gave a horrible jolt a test in front of the whole school but he didnt know any magic yet what on earth would he have to do he hadnt expected something like this the moment they arrivedhe looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified too no one was talking much except hermione granger who was whispering very fast about all the spells shed learned and wondering which one shed need harry tried hard not to listen to her hed never been more nervous never not even when hed had to take a school report home to the dursleys saying that hed somehow turned his teachers wig blue he kept his eyes fixed on the door any second now professor mcgonagall would come back and lead him to his doomthen something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air several people behind him screamedwhat the he gasped so did the people around him about twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall pearlywhite and slightly transparent they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years they seemed to be arguing what looked like a fat little monk was saying forgive and forget i say we ought to give him a second chance my dear friar havent we given peeves all the chances he deserves he gives us all a bad name and you know hes not really even a ghost i say what are you all doing herea ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first yearsnobody answerednew students said the fat friar smiling around at them about to be sorted i supposea few people nodded mutelyhope to see you in hufflepuff said the friar my old house you knowmove along now said a sharp voice the sorting ceremonys about to startprofessor mcgonagall had returned one by one the ghosts floated away through the opposite wallnow form a line professor mcgonagall told the first years and follow mefeeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair with ron behind him and they walked out of the chamber back across the hall and through a pair of double doors into the great hallharry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place it was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables where the rest of the students were sittingthese tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets at the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sittingprofessor mcgonagall led the first years up here so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students with the teachers behind themthe hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight dotted here and there among the students the ghosts shone misty silver mainly to avoid all the staring eyes harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars he heard hermione whisper its bewitched to look like the sky outside i read about it in hogwarts a historyit was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all and that the great hall didnt simply open on to the heavensharry quickly looked down again as professor mcgonagall silently placed a fourlegged stool in front of the first years on top of the stool she put a pointed wizards hat this hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty aunt petunia wouldnt have let it in the housemaybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it harry thought wildly that seemed the sort of thing noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat he stared at it too for a few seconds there was complete silence then the hat twitched a rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth and the hat began to sing oh you may not think im pretty but dont judge on what you see ill eat myself if you can find a smarter hat than meyou can keep your bowlers black your top hats sleek and tall for im the hogwarts sorting hat and i can cap them alltheres nothing hidden in your head the sorting hat cant see so try me on and i will tell you where you ought to beyou might belong in gryffindor where dwell the brave at heart their daring nerve and chivalry set gryffindors apart you might belong in hufflepuff where they are just and loyal those patient hufflepuffis are true and unafraid of toil or yet in wise old ravenclaw if youve a ready mind where those of wit and learning will always find their kind or perhaps in slytherin youll make your real friends those cunning folk use any means to achieve their endsso put me on dont be afraid and dont get in a flap youre in safe hands though i have none for im a thinking capthe whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song it bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still againso weve just got to try on the hat ron whispered to harry ill kill fred he was going on about wrestling a trollharry smiled weakly yes trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching the hat seemed to be asking rather alot harry didnt feel brave or quickwitted or any of it at the moment if only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy that would have been the one for himprofessor mcgonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchmentwhen i call your name you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted she said abbott hannaha pinkfaced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line put on the hat which fell right down over her eyes and sat down a moments pause hufflepuff shouted the hatthe table on the right cheered and clapped as hannah went to sit down at the hufflepuff table harry saw the ghost of the fat friar waving merrily at herbones susanhufflepuff shouted the hat again and susan scuttled off to sit next to hannahboot terryravenclawthe table second from the left clapped this time several ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with terry as he joined thembrocklehurst mandy went to ravenclaw too but brown lavenderbecame the first new gryffindor and the table on the far left exploded with cheers harry could see rons twin brothers catcallingbulstrode millicent then became a slytherin perhaps it was harrys imagination after all hed heard about slytherin but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot he was starting to feel definitely sick now he remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old schoolhe had always been last to be chosen not because he was no good but because no one wanted dudley to think they liked himfinchfletchley justinhufflepuffsometimes harry noticed the hat shouted out the house at once but at others it took a little while to decide finnigan seamus the sandyhaired boy next to harry in the line sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a gryffindorgranger hermionehermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her headgryffindor shouted the hat ron groaneda horrible thought struck harry as horrible thoughts always do when youre very nervous what if he wasnt chosen at all what if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages until professor mcgonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and hed better get back on the train when neville longbottom the boy who kept losing his toad was called he fell over on his way to the stool the hat took a long time to decide with neville when it finally shouted gryffindor neville ran off still wearing it and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to macdougal moragmalfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed slytherinmalfoy went to join his friends crabbe and goyle looking pleased with himselfthere werent many people left now moon nott parkinson then a pair of twin girls patil and patil then perks sallyanne and then at last potter harryas harry stepped forward whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hallpotter did she saythe harry potterthe last thing harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat he waitedhmm said a small voice in his ear difficult very difficult plenty of courage i see not a bad mind either theres talent a my goodness yes and a nice thirst to prove yourself now thats interestingso where shall i put youharry gripped the edges of the stool and thought not slytherin not slytherinnot slytherin eh said the small voice are you sure you could be great you know its all here in your head and slytherin will help you on the way to greatness no doubt about that no well if youre sure better be gryffindorharry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall he took off the hat and walked shakily toward the gryffindor table he was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in slytherin he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet percy the prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously while the weasley twins yelled we got potter we got potter harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff hed seen earlier the ghost patted his arm giving harry the sudden horrible feeling hed just plunged it into a bucket of icecold waterhe could see the high table properly now at the end nearest him sat hagrid who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up harry grinned back and there in the center of the high table in a large gold chair sat albus dumbledore harry recognized him at once from the card hed gotten out of the chocolate frog on the train dumbledores silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts harry spotted professor quirtell too the nervous young man from the leaky cauldron he was looking very peculiar in a large purple turbanand now there were only three people left to be sorted thomas deana black boy even taller than ron joined harry at the gryffindor tableturpin lisa became a ravenclaw and then it was rons turn he was pale green by now harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted gryffindorharry clapped loudly with the rest as ron collapsed into the chair next to himwell done ron excellent said percy weasley pompously across harry as zabini blaise was made a slytherin professor mcgonagall rolled up her scroll and took the sorting hat awayharry looked down at his empty gold plate he had only just realized how hungry he was the pumpkin pasties seemed ages agoalbus dumbledore had gotten to his feet he was beaming at the students his arms opened wide as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all therewelcome he said welcome to a new year at hogwarts before we begin our banquet i would like to say a few words and here they are nitwit blubber oddment tweak thank youhe sat back down everybody clapped and cheered harry didnt know whether to laugh or notis he a bit mad he asked percy uncertainlymad said percy airily hes a genius best wizard in the world but he is a bit mad yes potatoes harryharrys mouth fell open the dishes in front of him were now piled with food he had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table roast beef roast chicken pork chops and lamb chops sausages bacon and steak boiled potatoes roast potatoes fries yorkshire pudding peas carrots gravy ketchup and for some strange reason peppermint humbugsthe dursleys had never exactly starved harry but hed never been allowed to eat as much as he liked dudley had always taken anything that harry really wanted even if it made him sick harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eatit was all deliciousthat does look good said the ghost in the ruff sadly watching harry cut up his steak cant you i havent eaten for nearly four hundred years said the ghost i dont need to of course but one does miss it i dont think ive in troduced myself sir nicholas de mimsyporpington at your service resident ghost of gryffindor toweri know who you are said ron suddenly my brothers told me about you youre nearly headless nicki would prefer you to call me sir nicholas de mimsy the ghost began stiffly but sandyhaired seamus finnigan interruptednearly headless how can you be nearly headlesssir nicholas looked extremely miffed as if their little chat wasnt going at all the way he wantedlike this he said irritably he seized his left ear and pulled his whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge someone had obviously tried to behead him but not done it properly looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces nearly headless nick flipped his head back onto his neck coughed and said so new gryffindors i hope youre going to help us win the house championship this year gryffindors have never gone so long without winning slytherins have got the cup six years in a row the bloody barons becoming almost unbearable hes the slytherin ghostharry looked over at the slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there with blank staring eyes a gaunt face and robes stained with silver blood he was right next to malfoy who harry was pleased to see didnt look too pleased with the seating arrangementshow did he get covered in blood asked seamus with great interestive never asked said nearly headless nick delicatelywhen everyone had eaten as much as they could the remains of the food faded from the plates leaving them sparkling clean as before a moment later the desserts appeared blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of apple pies treacle tarts chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts trifle strawberries jello rice pudding Ã¢â‚¬Å“as harry helped himself to a treacle tart the talk turned to their familiesim halfandhalf said seamus me dads a muggle mom didnt tell him she was a witch til after they were married bit of a nasty shock for himthe others laughedwhat about you neville said ronwell my gran brought me up and shes a witch said neville but the family thought i was all muggle for ages my great uncle algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me he pushed me off the end of blackpool pier once i nearly drowned but nothing happened until i was eight great uncle algie came round for dinner and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my great auntie enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go but i bounced all the way down the garden and into the road they were all really pleased gran was crying she was so happy and you should have seen their faces when i got in here they thought i might not be magic enough to come you see great uncle algie was so pleased he bought me my toadon harrys other side percy weasley and hermione were talking about lessons i do hope they start right away theres so much to learn im particularly interested in transfiguration you know turning something into something else of course its supposed to be very difficult youll be starting small just matches into needles and that sort of thing harry who was starting to feel warm and sleepy looked up at the high table again hagrid was drinking deeply from his gobletprofessor mcgonagall was talking to professor dumbledore professor quirrell in his absurd turban was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair a hooked nose and sallow skinit happened very suddenly the hooknosed teacher looked past quirrells turban straight into harrys eyes and a sharp hot pain shot across the scar on harrys foreheadouch harry clapped a hand to his headwhat is it asked percynnothingthe pain had gone as quickly as it had come harder to shake off was the feeling harry had gotten from the teachers look a feeling that he didnt like harry at allwhos that teacher talking to professor quirrell he asked percyoh you know quirrell already do you no wonder hes looking so nervous thats professor snape he teaches potions but he doesnt want to everyone knows hes after quirrells job knows an awful lot about the dark arts snapeharry watched snape for a while but snape didnt look at him againat last the desserts too disappeared and professor dumbledore got to his feet again the hall fell silentahern just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered i have a few startofterm notices to give youfirst years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils and a few of our older students would do well to remember that as welldumbledores twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the weasley twinsi have also been asked by mr filch the caretaker to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridorsquidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact madam hoochand finally i must tell you that this year the thirdfloor corridor on the righthand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful deathharry laughed but he was one of the few who didhes not serious he muttered to percymust be said percy frowning at dumbledore its odd because he usually gives us a reason why were not allowed to go somewhere the forests full of dangerous beasts everyone knows that i do think he might have told us prefects at leastand now before we go to bed let us sing the school song cried dumbledore harry noticed that the other teachers smiles had become rather fixeddumbledore gave his wand a little flick as if he was trying to get a fly off the end and a long golden ribbon flew out of it which rose high above the tables and twisted itself snakelike into wordseveryone pick their favorite tune said dumbledore and off we goand the school bellowed hogwarts hogwarts hoggy warty hogwarts teach us something please whether we be old and bald or young with scabby knees our heads could do with filling with some interesting stuff for now theyre bare and full of air dead flies and bits of fluff so teach us things worth knowing bring back what weve forgot just do your best well do the rest and learn until our brains all roteverybody finished the song at different times at last only the weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral marchdumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished he was one of those who clapped loudestah music he said wiping his eyes a magic beyond all we do here and now bedtime off you trotthe gryffindor first years followed percy through the chattering crowds out of the great hall and up the marble staircase harrys legs were like lead again but only because he was so tired and full of food he was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed or that twice percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries they climbed more staircases yawning and dragging their feet and harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halta bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them and as percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at himpeeves percy whispered to the first years a poltergeist he raised his voice peeves show yourselfa loud rude sound like the air being let out of a balloon answereddo you want me to go to the bloody baronthere was a pop and a little man with wicked dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared floating cross legged in the air clutching the walking sticksoooooooh he said with an evil cackle ickle firsties what funhe swooped suddenly at them they all duckedgo away peeves or the baronll hear about this i mean it barked percypeeves stuck out his tongue and vanished dropping the walking sticks on nevilles head they heard him zooming away rattling coats of armor as he passedyou want to watch out for peeves said percy as they set off againthe bloody barons the only one who can control him he wont even listen to us prefects here we areat the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dresspassword she said caput draconis said percy and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall they all scrambled through it neville needed a leg up and found themselves in the gryffindor common room a cozy round room full of squashy armchairspercy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another at the top of a spiral staircase they were obviously in one of the towers they found their beds at last five fourposters hung with deep red velvet curtains their trunks had already been brought up too tired to talk much they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bedgreat food isnt it ron muttered to harry through the hangingsget off scabbers hes chewing my sheetsharry was going to ask ron if hed had any of the treacle tart but he fell asleep almost at onceperhaps harry had eaten a bit too much because he had a very strange dream he was wearing professor quirrells turban which kept talking to him telling him he must transfer to slytherin at once because it was his destiny harry told the turban he didnt want to be in slytherin it got heavier and heavier he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully and there was malfoy laughing at him as he struggled with it then malfoy turned into the hooknosed teacher snape whose laugh became high and cold there was a burst of green light and harry woke sweating and shakinghe rolled over and fell asleep again and when he woke next day he didnt remember the dream at allchapter eightthe potions masterthere lookwherenext to the tall kid with the red hairwearing the glassesdid you see his facedid you see his scarwhispers followed harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day people lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again staringharry wished they wouldnt because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classesthere were a hundred and fortytwo staircases at hogwarts wide sweeping ones narrow rickety ones some that led somewhere different on a friday some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump then there were doors that wouldnt open unless you asked politely or tickled them in exactly the right place and doors that werent really doors at all but solid walls just pretending it was also very hard to remember where anything was because it all seemed to move around a lot the people in the portraits kept going to visit each other and harry was sure the coats of armor could walkthe ghosts didnt help either it was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open nearly headless nick was always happy to point new gryffindors in the right direction but peeves the poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class he would drop wastepaper baskets on your head pull rugs from under your feet pelt you with bits of chalk or sneak up behind you invisible grab your nose and screech got your conkeven worse than peeves if that was possible was the caretaker argus filch harry and ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the outofbounds corridor on the third floor he wouldnt believe they were lost was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by professor quirrell who was passingfilch owned a cat called mrs norris a scrawny dustcolored creature with bulging lamp like eyes just like filchs she patrolled the corridors alone break a rule in front of her put just one toe out of line and shed whisk off for filch whod appear wheezing two seconds later filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone except perhaps the weasley twins and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts the students all hated him and it was the dearest ambition of many to give mrs norris a good kickand then once you had managed to find them there were the classes themselves there was a lot more to magic as harry quickly found out than waving your wand and saying a few funny wordsthey had to study the night skies through their telescopes every wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study herbology with a dumpy little witch called professor sprout where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi and found out what they were used foreasily the most boring class was history of magic which was the only one taught by a ghost professor binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach leaving his body behind him binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates and got emetic the evil and uric the oddball mixed upprofessor flitwick the charms teacher was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk at the start of their first class he took the roll call and when he reached harrys name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sightprofessor mcgonagall was again different harry had been quite right to think she wasnt a teacher to cross strict and clever she gave them a talkingto the moment they sat down in her first classtransfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at hogwarts she said anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back you have been warnedthen she changed her desk into a pig and back again they were all very impressed and couldnt wait to get started but soon realized they werent going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long timeafter taking a lot of complicated notes they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle by the end of the lesson only hermione granger had made any difference to her match professor mcgonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave hermione a rare smilethe class everyone had really been looking forward to was defense against the dark arts but quirrells lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke his classroom smelled strongly of garlic which everyone said was to ward off a vampire hed met in romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days his turban he told them had been given to him by an african prince as a thankyou for getting rid of a troublesome zombie but they werent sure they believed this storyfor one thing when seamus finnigan asked eagerly to hear how quirrell had fought off the zombie quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather for another they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban and the weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well so that quirrell was protected wherever he wentharry was very relieved to find out that he wasnt miles behind everyone else lots of people had come from muggle families and like him hadnt had any idea that they were witches and wizards there was so much to learn that even people like ron didnt have much of a head startfriday was an important day for harry and ron they finally managed to find their way down to the great hall for breakfast without getting lost oncewhat have we got today harry asked ron as he poured sugar on his porridgedouble potions with the slytherins said ron snapes head of slytherin house they say he always favors them well be able to see if its truewish mcgonagall favored us said harry professor mcgonagall was head of gryffindor house but it hadnt stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day beforejust then the mail arrived harry had gotten used to this by now but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the great hall during breakfast circling the tables until they saw their owners and dropping letters and packages onto their lapshedwig hadnt brought harry anything so far she sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls this morning however she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto harrys plate harry tore it open at once it said in a very untidy scrawl dear harry i know you get friday afternoons off so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three i want to hear all about your first week send us an answer back with hedwighagrid harry borrowed rons quill scribbled yes please see you later on the back of the note and sent hedwig off againit was lucky that harry had tea with hagrid to look forward to because the potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so farat the startofterm banquet harry had gotten the idea that professor snape disliked him by the end of the first potions lesson he knew hed been wrong snape didnt dislike harry he hated himpotions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons it was colder here than up in the main castle and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the wallssnape like flitwick started the class by taking the roll call and like flitwick he paused at harrys nameah yes he said softly harry potter our new celebritydraco malfoy and his friends crabbe and goyle sniggered behind their hands snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class his eyes were black like hagrids but they had none of hagrids warmththey were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnelsyou are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking he began he spoke in barely more than a whisper but they caught every word like professor mcgonagall snape had y caught every word like professor mcgonagall snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort as there is little foolish wandwaving here many of you will hardly believe this is magic i dont expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins bewitching the mind ensnaring the senses i can teach you how to bottle fame brew glory even stopper death if you arent as big a bunch of dunderheads as i usually have to teachmore silence followed this little speech harry and ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows hermione granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasnt a dunderheadpotter said snape suddenly what would i get if i added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwoodpowdered root of what to an infusion of what harry glanced at ron who looked as stumped as he was hermiones hand had shot into the airi dont know sit said harrysnapes lips curled into a sneertut tut fame clearly isnt everythinghe ignored hermiones handlets try again potter where would you look if i told you to find me a bezoarhermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat but harry didnt have the faintest idea what a bezoar was he tried not to look at malfoy crabbe and goyle who were shaking with laughteri dont know sit thought you wouldnt open a book before coming eh potter harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes he had looked through his books at the dursleys but did snape expect him to remember everything in one thousand magical herbs and fungi snape was still ignoring hermiones quivering handwhat is the difference potter between monkshood and wolfsbaneat this hermione stood up her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceilingi dont know said harry quietly i think hermione does though why dont you try hera few people laughed harry caught seamuss eye and seamus winkedsnape however was not pleasedsit down he snapped at hermione for your information potter asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the draught of living death a bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons as for monkshood and wolfsbane they are the same plant which also goes by the name of aconite well why arent you all copying that downthere was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment over the noise snape said and a point will be taken from gryffindor house for your cheek potterthings didnt improve for the gryffindors as the potions lesson continued snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils he swept around in his long black cloak watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs criticizing almost everyone except malfoy whom he seemed to like he was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon neville had somehow managed to melt seamuss cauldron into a twisted blob and their potion was seeping across the stone floor burning holes in peoples shoes within seconds the whole class was standing on their stools while neville who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legsidiot boy snarled snape clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand i suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fireneville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nosetake him up to the hospital wing snape spat at seamus then he rounded on harry and ron who had been working next to nevilleyou potter why didnt you tell him not to add the quills thought hed make you look good if he got it wrong did you thats another point youve lost for gryffindorthis was so unfair that harry opened his mouth to argue but ron kicked him behind their cauldrondoi push it he muttered ive heard snape can turn very nastyas they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later harrys mind was racing and his spirits were low hed lost two points for gryffindor in his very first week why did snape hate him so much cheer upsaid ron snapes always taking points off fred and george can i come and meet hagrid with youat five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest a crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front doorwhen harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks then hagrids voice rang out saying back fang backhagrids big hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door openhang on he said back fanghe let them in struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhoundthere was only one room inside hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over itmake yerselves at home said hagrid letting go of fang who bounded straight at ron and started licking his ears like hagrid fang was clearly not as fierce as he lookedthis is ron harry told hagrid who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plateanother weasley eh said hagrid glancing at rons freckles i spent half me life chasin yer twin brothers away from the forestthe rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth but harry and ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told hagrid all about their first lessons fang rested his head on harrys knee and drooled all over his robesharry and ron were delighted to hear hagrid call fitch that old gitan as fer that cat mrs norris id like ter introduce her to fang sometime dyeh know every time i go up ter the school she follows me everywhere cant get rid of her fitch puts her up to itharry told hagrid about snapes lesson hagrid like ron told harry not to worry about it that snape liked hardly any of the studentsbut he seemed to really hate merubbish said hagrid why should heyet harry couldnt help thinking that hagrid didnt quite meet his eyes when he said thathows yer brother charlie hagrid asked ron i liked him a lot great with animalsharry wondered if hagrid had changed the subject on purpose while ron told hagrid all about charlies work with dragons harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy it was a cutting from the daily prophet gringotts breakin latest investigations continue into the breakin at gringotts on july widely believed to be the work of dark wizards or witches unknowngringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken the vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same daybut were not telling you what was in there so keep your noses out if you know whats good for you said a gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoonharry remembered ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob gringotts but ron hadnt mentioned the datehagrid said harry that gringotts breakin happened on my birthday it mightve been happening while we were therethere was no doubt about it hagrid definitely didnt meet harrys eyes this time he grunted and offered him another rock cake harry read the story again the vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen if you could call it emptying taking out that grubby little package had that been what the thieves were looking for as harry and ron walked back to the castle for dinner their pockets weighed down with rock cakes theyd been too polite to refuse harry thought that none of the lessons hed had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with hagrid had hagrid collected that package just in time where was it now and did hagrid know something about snape that he didnt want to tell harry chapter ninethe midnight duelharry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than dudley but that was before he met draco malfoy still firstyear gryffindors only had potions with the slytherins so they didnt have to put up with malfoy much or at least they didnt until they spotted a notice pinned up in the gryffindor common room that made them all groanflying lessons would be starting on thursday and gryffindor and slytherin would be learning togethertypical said harry darkly just what i always wanted to make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of malfoyhe had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything elseyou dont know that youll make a fool of yourself said ron reasonably anyway i know malfoys always going on about how good he is at quidditch but i bet thats all talkmalfay certainly did talk about flying a lot he complained loudly about first years never getting on the house quidditch teams and told long boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping muggles in helicopters he wasnt the only one though the way seamus finnigan told it hed spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick even ron would tell anyone whod listen about the time hed almost hit a hang glider on charlies old broomeveryone from wizarding families talked about quidditch constantly ron had already had a big argument with dean thomas who shared their dormitory about soccer ron couldnt see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly harry had caught ron prodding deans poster of west ham soccer team trying to make the players moveneville had never been on a broomstick in his life because his grandmother had never let him near one privately harry felt shed had good reason because neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the groundhermione granger was almost as nervous about flying as neville was this was something you couldnt learn by heart out of a book not that she hadnt tried at breakfast on thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips shed gotten out of a library book called quidditch through the ages neville was hanging on to her every word desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later but everybody else was very pleased when hermiones lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mailharry hadnt had a single letter since hagrids note something that malfoy had been quick to notice of course malfoys eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home which he opened gloatingly at the slytherin tablea barn owl brought neville a small package from his grandmother he opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble which seemed to be full of white smokeits a remembrall he explained gran knows i forget things this tells you if theres something youve forgotten to do look you hold it tight like this and if it turns red oh his face fell because the remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet youve forgotten somethingneville was trying to remember what hed forgotten when draco malfoy who was passing the gryffindor table snatched the remembrall out of his handharry and ron jumped to their feet they were half hoping for a reason to fight malfay but professor mcgonagall who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school was there in a flashwhats going onmalfoys got my remembrall professorscowling malfoy quickly dropped the remembrall back on the tablejust looking he said and he sloped away with crabbe and goyle behind himat threethirty that afternoon harry ron and the other gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson it was a clear breezy day and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest whose trees were swaying darkly in the distancethe slytherins were already there and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground harry had heard fred and george weasley complain about the school brooms saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high or always flew slightly to the lefttheir teacher madam hooch arrived she had short gray hair and yellow eyes like a hawkwell what are you all waiting for she barked everyone stand by a broomstick come on hurry upharry glanced down at his broom it was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd anglesstick out your right hand over your broom called madam hooch at the front and say up upf everyone shoutedharrys broom jumped into his hand at once but it was one of the few that did hermione grangers had simply rolled over on the ground and nevilles hadnt moved at all perhaps brooms like horses could tell when you were afraid thought harry there was a quaver in nevilles voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the groundmadam hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end and walked up and down the rows correcting their gripsharry and ron were delighted when she told malfoy hed been doing it wrong for yearsnow when i blow my whistle you kick off from the ground hard said madam hooch keep your brooms steady rise a few feet and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly on my whistle three two but neville nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground pushed off hard before the whistle had touched madam hoochs lipscome back boy she shouted but neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle twelve feet twenty feet harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away saw him gasp slip sideways off the broom and wham a thud and a nasty crack and neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap his broomstick was still rising higher and higher and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sightmadam hooch was bending over neville her face as white as hisbroken wrist harry heard her mutter come on boy its all right up you getshe turned to the rest of the classnone of you is to move while i take this boy to the hospital wing you leave those brooms where they are or youll be out of hogwarts before you can say quidditch come on dearneville his face tearstreaked clutching his wrist hobbled off with madam hooch who had her arm around himno sooner were they out of earshot than malfoy burst into laughterdid you see his face the great lumpthe other slytherins joined inshut up malfoy snapped parvati patilooh sticking up for longbottom said pansy parkinson a hardfaced slytherin girl never thought youd like fat little crybabies parvatilook said malfoy darting forward and snatching something out of the grass its that stupid thing longbottoms gran sent himthe remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it upgive that here malfoy said harry quietly everyone stopped talking to watchmalfoy smiled nastilyi think ill leave it somewhere for longbottom to find how about up a treegive it here harry yelled but malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off he hadnt been lying he could fly well hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called come and get it potterharry grabbed his broomno shouted hermione granger madam hooch told us not to move youll get us all into troubleharry ignored her blood was pounding in his ears he mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up up he soared air rushed through his hair and his robes whipped out behind him and in a rush of fierce joy he realized hed found something he could do without being taught this was easy this was wonderful he pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from ronhe turned his broomstick sharply to face malfoy in midair malfoy looked stunnedgive it here harry called or ill knock you off that broom oh yeah said malfoy trying to sneer but looking worriedharry knew somehow what to do he leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands and it shot toward malfay like a javelin malfoy only just got out of the way in time harry made a sharp aboutface and held the broom steady a few people below were clappingno crabbe and goyle up here to save your neck malfoy harry calledthe same thought seemed to have struck malfoycatch it if you can then he shouted and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the groundharry saw as though in slow motion the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall he leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive racing the ball wind whistled in his ears mingled with the screams of people watching he stretched out his hand a foot from the ground he caught it just in time to pull his broom straight and he toppled gently onto the grass with the remembrall clutched safely in his fistharry potterhis heart sank faster than hed just dived professor mcgonagall was running toward them he got to his feet tremblingnever in all my time at hogwarts professor mcgonagall was almost speechless with shock and her glasses flashed furiously how dare you might have broken your neck it wasnt his fault professor be quiet miss patil but malfoy thats enough mr weasley potter follow me nowharry caught sight of malfoy crabbe and goyles triumphant faces as he left walking numbly in professor mcgonagalls wake as she strode toward the castle he was going to be expelled he just knew it he wanted to say something to defend himself but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice professor mcgonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him he had to jog to keep up now hed done it he hadnt even lasted two weeks hed be packing his bags in ten minutes what would the dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep up the front steps up the marble staircase inside and still professor mcgonagall didnt say a word to him she wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with harry trotting miserably behind her maybe she was taking him to dumbledore he thought of hagrid expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper perhaps he could be hagrids assistant his stomach twisted as he imagined it watching ron and the others becoming wizards while he stumped around the grounds carrying hagrids bagprofessor mcgonagall stopped outside a classroom she opened the door and poked her head insideexcuse me professor flitwick could i borrow wood for a momentwood thought harry bewildered was wood a cane she was going to use on him but wood turned out to be a person a burly fifthyear boy who came out of flitwicles class looking confusedfollow me you two said professor mcgonagall and they marched on up the corridor wood looking curiously at harryin hereprofessor mcgonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for peeves who was busy writing rude words on the blackboardout peeves she barked peeves threw the chalk into a bin which clanged loudly and he swooped out cursing professor mcgonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boyspotter this is oliver wood wood ive found you a seekerwoods expression changed from puzzlement to delightare you serious professorabsolutely said professor mcgonagall crisply the boys a naturalive never seen anything like it was that your first time on a broomstick potterharry nodded silently he didnt have a clue what was going on but he didnt seem to be being expelled and some of the feeling started coming back to his legshe caught that thing in his hand after a fiftyfoot dive professor mcgonagall told wood didnt even scratch himself charlie weasley couldnt have done itwood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at onceever seen a game of quidditch potter he asked excitedlywoods captain of the gryffindor team professor mcgonagall explainedhes just the build for a seeker too said wood now walking around harry and staring at him light speedy well have to

hard potter or i may change my mind about punishing youthen she suddenly smiledyour father would have been proud she said he was an excellent quidditch player himselfyoure jokingit was dinnertime harry had just finished telling ron what had happened when hed left the grounds with professor mcgonagall ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth but hed forgotten all about itseeker he said but first years never you must be the youngest house player in about a century said harry shoveling pie into his mouth he felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon wood told meron was so amazed so impressed he just sat and gaped at harryi start training next week said harry only dont tell anyone wood wants to keep it a secretfred and george weasley now came into the hall spotted harry and hurried overwell done said george in a low voice wood told us were on the team too beatersi tell you were going to win that quidditch cup for sure this yearsaid fred we havent won since charlie left but this years team is going to be brilliant you must be good harry wood was almost skipping when he told usanyway weve got to go lee jordan reckons hes found a new secret passageway out of the schoolbet its that one behind the statue of gregory the smarmy that we found in our first week see youfred and george had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up malfoy flanked by crabbe and goylehaving a last meal potter when are you getting the train back to the mugglesyoure a lot braver now that youre back on the ground and youve got your little friends with you said harry coolly there was of course nothing at all little about crabbe and goyle but as the high table was full of teachers neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowlid take you on anytime on my own said malfoy tonight if you wantwizards duel wands only no contact whats the matter never heard of a wizards duel before i supposeof course he has said ron wheeling around im his second whos yoursmalfoy looked at crabbe and goyle sizing them upcrabbe he said midnight all right well meet you in the trophy room thats always unlockedwhen malfoy had gone ron and harry looked at each other what is a wizards duel said harry and what do you mean youre my secondwell a seconds there to take over if you die said ron casually getting started at last on his cold pie catching the look on harrys face he added quickly but people only die in proper duels you know with real wizards the most you and malfoyll be able to do is send sparks at each other neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage i bet he expected you to refuse anywayand what if i wave my wand and nothing happensthrow it away and punch him on the nose ron suggested excuse methey both looked up it was hermione grangercant a person eat in peace in this place said ronhermione ignored him and spoke to harryi couldnt help overhearing what you and malfoy were saying bet you could ron mutteredand you mustnt go wandering around the school at night think of the points youll lose gryffindor if youre caught and youre bound to beits really very selfish of youand its really none of your business said harrygoodbye said ronall the same it wasnt what youd call the perfect end to the day harry thought as he lay awake much later listening to dean and seamus falling asleep neville wasnt back from the hospital wing ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as if he tries to curse you youd better dodge it because i cant remember how to block themthere was a very good chance they were going to get caught by filch or mrs norris and harry felt he was pushing his luck breaking another school rule today on the other hand malfoys sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness this was his big chance to beat malfoy facetoface he couldnt miss ithalfpast eleven ron muttered at last wed better gothey pulled on their bathrobes picked up their wands and crept across the tower room down the spiral staircase and into the gryffindor common room a few embers were still glowing in the fireplace turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows they had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them i cant believe youre going to do this harrya lamp flickered on it was hermione granger wearing a pink bathrobe and a frownyou said ron furiously go back to bedi almost told your brother hermione snapped percy hes a prefect hed put a stop to thisharry couldnt believe anyone could be so interferingcome on he said to ron he pushed open the portrait of the fat lady and climbed through the holehermione wasnt going to give up that easily she followed ron through the portrait hole hissing at them like an angry goosedont you care about gryffindor do you only care about yourselves i dont want slytherin to win the house cup and youll lose all the points i got from professor mcgonagall for knowing about switching spellsgo away all right but i warned you you just remember what i said when youre on the train home tomorrow youre so but what they were they didnt find out hermione had turned to the portrait of the fat lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting the fat lady had gone on a nighttime visit and hermione was locked out of gryffindor towernow what am i going to do she asked shrillythats your problem said ron weve got to go we re going to be latethey hadnt even reached the end of the corridor when hermione caught up with themim coming with you she saidyou are notdyou think im going to stand out here and wait for filch to catch me if he finds all three of us ill tell him the truth that i was trying to stop you and you can back me upyouve got some nerve said ron loudlyshut up both of you said harry sharply i heard somethingit was a sort of snufflingmrs norris breathed ron squinting through the darkit wasnt mrs norris it was neville he was curled up on the floor fast asleep but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearerthank goodness you found me ive been out here for hours i couldnt remember the new password to get in to bedkeep your voice down neville the passwords pig snout but it wont help you now the fat ladys gone off somewherehows your arm said harryfine said neville showing them madam pomfrey mended it in about a minutegood well look neville weve got to be somewhere well see you later dont leave me said neville scrambling to his feet i dont want to stay here alone the bloody barons been past twice alreadyron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at hermione and nevilleif either of you get us caught ill never rest until ive learned that curse of the bogies quirrell told us about and used it on youhermione opened her mouth perhaps to tell ron exactly how to use the curse of the bogies but harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forwardthey flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows at every turn harry expected to run into filch or mrs norris but they were lucky they sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy roommalfoy and crabbe werent there yet the crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them cups shields plates and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness they edged along the walls keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room harry took out his wand in case malfoy leapt in and started at once the minutes crept byhes late maybe hes chickened out ron whisperedthen a noise in the next room made them jump harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak and it wasnt malfoysniff around my sweet they might be lurking in a cornerit was filch speaking to mrs norris horrorstruck harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible they scurried silently toward the door away from filchs voice nevilles robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard filch enter the trophy roomtheyre in here somewhere they heard him mutter probably hidingthis way harry mouthed to the others and petrified they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor they could hear filch getting nearer neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run he tripped grabbed ron around the waist and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armorthe clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castlerun harry yelled and the four of them sprinted down the gallery not looking back to see whether filch was following they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another harry in the lead without any idea where they were or where they were going they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway hurtled along it and came out near their charms classroom which they knew was miles from the trophy roomi think weve lost him harry panted leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead neville was bent double wheezing and splutteringi told you hermione gasped clutching at the stitch in her chest i told youweve got to get back to gryffindor tower said ron quickly as possiblemalfoy tricked you hermione said to harry you realize that dont you he was never going to meet you filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room malfoy must have tipped him offharry thought she was probably right but he wasnt going to tell her thatlets goit wasnt going to be that simple they hadnt gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of themit was peeves he caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delightshut up peeves please youll get us thrown outpeeves cackledwandering around at midnight ickle firsties tut tut tut naughty naughty youll get caughtynot if you dont give us away peeves pleaseshould tell filch i should said peeves in a saintly voice but his eyes glittered wickedly its for your own good you knowget out of the way snapped ron taking a swipe at peeves this was a big mistakestudents out of bed peeves bellowed students out of bed down the charms corridorducking under peeves they ran for their lives right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door and it was lockedthis is it ron moaned as they pushed helplessly at the door were done for this is the end they could hear footsteps filch running as fast as he could toward peevess shoutsoh move over hermione snarled she grabbed harrys wand tapped the lock and whispered alohomorathe lock clicked and the door swung open they piled through it shut it quickly and pressed their ears against it listeningwhich way did they go peeves filch was saying quick tell mesay please dont mess with me peeves now where did they goshant say nothing if you dont say please said peeves in his annoying singsong voiceall right pleasenothing ha haaa told you i wouldnt say nothing if you didnt say please ha ha haaaaaa and they heard the sound of peeves whooshing away and filch cursing in ragehe thinks this door is locked harry whispered i think well be okay get off neville for neville had been tugging on the sleeve of harrys bathrobe for the last minute whatharry turned around and saw quite clearly what for a moment he was sure hed walked into a nightmare this was too much on top of everything that had happened so farthey werent in a room as he had supposed they were in a corridor the forbidden corridor on the third floor and now they knew why it was forbiddenthey were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor it had three headsthree pairs of rolling mad eyes three noses twitching and quivering in their direction three drooling mouths saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangsit was standing quite still all six eyes staring at them and harry knew that the only reason they werent already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise but it was quickly getting over that there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meantharry groped for the doorknob between filch and death hed take filchthey fell backward harry slammed the door shut and they ran they almost flew back down the corridor filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else because they didnt see him anywhere but they hardly cared all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster they didnt stop running until they reached the portrait of the fat lady on the seventh floorwhere on earth have you all been she asked looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed sweaty facesnever mind that pig snout pig snout panted harry and the portrait swung forward they scrambled into the common room and collapsed trembling into armchairsit was a while before any of them said anything neville indeed looked as if hed never speak againwhat do they think theyre doing keeping a thing like that locked up in a school said ron finally if any dog needs exercise that one doeshermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again you dont use your eyes any of you do you she snapped didnt you see what it was standing onthe floor harry suggested i wasnt looking at its feet i was too busy with its headsno not the floor it was standing on a trapdoor its obviously guarding somethingshe stood up glaring at themi hope youre pleased with yourselves we could all have been killed or worse expelled now if you dont mind im going to bedron stared after her his mouth openno we dont mind he said youd think we dragged her along wouldnt youbut hermione had given harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed the dog was guarding something what had hagrid said gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide except perhaps hogwartsit looked as though harry had found out where the grubby littie package from vault seven hundred and thirteen waschapter tenhalloweenmalfoy couldnt believe his eyes when he saw that harry and ron were still at hogwarts the next day looking tired but perfectly cheerfulindeed by the next morning harry and ron thought that meeting the threeheaded dog had been an excellent adventure and they were quite keen to have another one in the meantime harry filled ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from gringotts to hogwarts and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection its either really valuable or really dangerous said ronor both said harrybut as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long they didnt have much chance of guessing what it was without further cluesneither neville nor hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor all neville cared about was never going near the dog againhermione was now refusing to speak to harry and ron but she was such a bossy knowitall that they saw this as an added bonus all they really wanted now was a way of getting back at malfoy and to their great delight just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week lateras the owls flooded into the great hall as usual everyones attention was caught at once by a long thin package carried by six large screech owls harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him knocking his bacon to the floor they had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcelharry ripped open the letter first which was lucky because it said do not open the parcel at the tableit contains your new nimbus two thousand but i dont want everybody knowing youve got a broomstick or theyll all want one oliver wood will meet you tonight on the quidditch field at seven oclock for your first training sessionprofessor mcgonagall harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to ron to reada nimbus two thousand ron moaned enviously ive never even touched onethey left the hall quickly wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by crabbe and goyle malfoy seized the package from harry and felt itthats a broomstick he said throwing it back to harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face youll be in for it this time potter first years arent allowed themron couldnt resist itits not any old broomstick he said its a nimbus two thousandwhat did you say youve got at home malfoy a comet two sixty ron grinned at harry comets look flashy but theyre not in the same league as the nimbuswhat would you know about it weasley you couldnt afford half the handle malfoy snapped back i suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twigbefore ron could answer professor flitwick appeared at malfoys elbownot arguing i hope boys he squeakedpotters been sent a broomstick professor said malfoy quicklyyes yes thats right said professor flitwick beaming at harryprofessor mcgonagall told me all about the special circumstances potter and what model is ita nimbus two thousand sit said harry fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on malfoys face and its really thanks to malfoy here that ive got it he addedharry and ron headed upstairs smothering their laughter at malfoys obvious rage and confusion well its true harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase if he hadnt stolen nevilles remembrall i woulnt be on the teamso i suppose you think thats a reward for breaking rules came an angry voice from just behind them hermione was stomping up the stairs looking disapprovingly at the package in harrys handi thought you werent speaking to us said harryyes dont stop now said ron its doing us so much goodhermione marched away with her nose in the airharry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day it kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed or straying off to the quidditch field where hed be learning to play that night he bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating and then rushed upstairs with ron to unwrap the nimbus two thousand at lastwow ron sighed as the broomstick rolled onto harrys bedspreadeven harry who knew nothing about the different brooms thought it looked wonderful sleek and shiny with a mahogany handle it had a long tail of neat straight twigs and nimbus two thousand written in gold near the topas seven oclock drew nearer harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the quidditch field held never been inside the stadium before hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on at either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end they reminded harry of the little plastic sticks muggle children blew bubbles through except that they were fifty feet hightoo eager to fly again to wait for wood harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground what a feeling he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field the nimbus two thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touchhey potter come down oliver wood had arrived fie was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm harry landed next to himvery nice said wood his eyes glinting i see what mcgonagall meant you really are a natural im just going to teach you the rules this evening then youll be joining team practice three times a weekhe opened the crate inside were four differentsized ballsright said wood now quidditch is easy enough to understand even if its not too easy to play there are seven players on each sidethree of them are called chasersthree chasers harry repeated as wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ballthis balls called the quaffle said wood the chasers throw the quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal ten points every time the quaffle goes through one of the hoops follow methe chasers throw the quaffle and put it through the hoops to scoreharry recited so thats sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops isnt itwhats basketball said wood curiously never mind said harry quicklynow theres another player on each side whos called the keeper im keeper for gryffindor i have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoringthree chasers one keeper said harry who was determined to remember it all and they play with the quaffle okay got that so what are they for he pointed at the three balls left inside the boxill show you now said wood take thishe handed harry a small club a bit like a short baseball batim going to show you what the bludgers do wood said these two are the bludgershe showed harry two identical balls jet black and slightly smaller than the red quaffle harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the boxstand back wood warned harry he bent down and freed one of the bludgersat once the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at harrys face harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose and sent it zigzagging away into the air it zoomed around their heads and then shot at wood who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the groundsee wood panted forcing the struggling bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely the bludgers rocket around trying to knock players off their brooms thats why you have two beaters on each team the weasley twins are ours its their job to protect their side from the bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team so think youve got all thatthree chasers try and score with the quaffle the keeper guards the goal posts the beaters keep the bludgers away from their team harry reeled offvery good said wooder have the bludgers ever killed anyone harry asked hoping he sounded offhandnever at hogwarts weve had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that now the last member of the team is the seeker thats you and you dont have to worry about the quaffle or the bludgers unless they crack my head opendont worry the weasleys are more than a match for the bludgers i mean theyre like a pair of human bludgers themselveswood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ballcompared with the quaffle and the bludgers it was tiny about the size of a large walnut it was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wingsthis said wood is the golden snitch and its the most important ball of the lot its very hard to catch because its so fast and difficult to see its the seekers job to catch it youve got to weave in and out of the chasers beaters bludgers and quaffle to get it before the other teams seeker because whichever seeker catches the snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points so they nearly always win thats why seekers get fouled so much a game of quidditch only ends when the snitch is caught so it can go on for ages i think the record is three months they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep well thats it any questionsharry shook his head he understood what he had to do all right it was doing it that was going to be the problemwe wont practice with the snitch yet said wood carefully shutting it back inside the crate its too dark we might lose it lets try you out with a few of thesehe pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later he and harry were up in the air wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for harry to catchharry didnt miss a single one and wood was delighted after half an hour night had really fallen and they couldnt carry onthat quidditch cupll have our name on it this year said wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle i wouldnt be surprised if you turn out better than charlie weasley and he could have played for england if he hadnt gone off chasing dragonsperhaps it was because he was now so busy what with quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework but harry could hardly believe it when he realized that hed already been at hogwarts two months the castle felt more like home than privet drive ever had his lessons too were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basicson halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors even better professor flitwick announced in charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly something they had all been dying to try since theyd seen him make nevilles toad zoom around the classroom professor flitwick put the class into pairs to practice harrys partner was seamus finnigan which was a relief because neville had been trying to catch his eye ron however was to be working with hermione granger it was hard to tell whether ron or hermione was angrier about this she hadnt spoken to either of them since the day harrys broomstick had arrivednow dont forget that nice wrist movement weve been practicingsqueaked professor flitwick perched on top of his pile of books as usual swish and flick remember swish and flick and saying the magic words properly is very important too never forget wizard baruffio who said s instead of f and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chestit was very difficult harry and seamus swished and flicked but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it harry had to put it out with his hatron at the next table wasnt having much more luckwingardium leviosa he shouted waving his long arms like a windmillyoure saying it wrong harry heard hermione snap its winggardium leviosa make the gar nice and longyou do it then if youre so clever ron snarledhermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown flicked her wand and said wingardium leviosatheir feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their headsoh well done cried professor flitwick clapping everyone see here miss grangers done itron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class its no wonder no one can stand her he said to harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor shes a nightmare honestly Ã¢â‚¬Å“someone knocked into harry as they hurried past him it was hermioneharry caught a glimpse of her face and was startled to see that she was in tearsi think she heard youso said ron but he looked a bit uncomfortable she mustve noticed shes got no friendshermione didnt turn up for the next class and wasnt seen all afternoon on their way down to the great hall for the halloween feast harry and ron overheard parvati patil telling her friend lavender that hermione was crying in the girls bathroom and wanted to be left aloneron looked still more awkward at this but a moment later they had entered the great hall where the halloween decorations put hermione out of their mindsa thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds making the candles in the pumpkins stutter the feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates as it had at the startofterm banquetharry was just helping himself to a baked potato when professor quirrell came sprinting into the hall his turban askew and terror on his faceeveryone stared as he reached professor dumbledores chair slumped against the table and gasped troll in the dungeons thought you ought to knowhe then sank to the floor in a dead faintthere was an uproar it took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of professor dumbledores wand to bring silenceprefects he rumbled lead your houses back to the dormitories immediatelypercy was in his elementfollow me stick together first years no need to fear the troll if you follow my orders stay close behind me now make way first years coming through excuse me im a prefecthow could a troll get in harry asked as they climbed the stairsdont ask me theyre supposed to be really stupid said ron maybe peeves let it in for a halloween jokethey passed different groups of people hurrying in different directionsas they jostled their way through a crowd of confused hufflepuffs harry suddenly grabbed rons armive just thought hermionewhat about hershe doesnt know about the trollron bit his lipoh all right he snapped but percyd better not see usducking down they joined the hufflepuffs going the other way slipped down a deserted side corridor and hurried off toward the girls bathroom they had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind thempercy hissed ron pulling harry behind a large stone griffinpeering around it however they saw not percy but snape he crossed the corridor and disappeared from viewwhats he doing harry whispered why isnt he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teacherssearch mequietly as possible they crept along the next corridor after snapes fading footstepshes heading for the third floor harry said but ron held up his handcan you smell somethingharry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to cleanand then they heard it a low grunting and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet ron pointed at the end of a passage to the left something huge was moving toward them they shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlightit was a horrible sight twelve feet tall its skin was a dull granite gray its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut it had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat horny feet the smell coming from it was incredible it was holding a huge wooden club which dragged along the floor because its arms were so longthe troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside it waggled its long ears making up its tiny mind then slouched slowly into the roomthe keys in the lock harry muttered we could lock it ingood idea said ron nervouslythey edged toward the open door mouths dry praying the troll wasnt about to come out of it with one great leap harry managed to grab the key slam the door and lock ityesflushed with their victory they started to run back up the passage but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop a high petrified scream and it was coming from the chamber theyd just chained upoh no said ron pale as the bloody baronits the girls bathroom harry gaspedhermione they said togetherit was the last thing they wanted to do but what choice did they have wheeling around they sprinted back to the door and turned the key fumbling in their panic harry pulled the door open and they ran insidehermione granger was shrinking against the wall opposite looking as if she was about to faint the troll was advancing on her knocking the sinks off the walls as it wentconfuse it harry said desperately to ron and seizing a tap he threw it as hard as he could against the wallthe troll stopped a few feet from hermione it lumbered around blinking stupidly to see what had made the noise its mean little eyes saw harry it hesitated then made for him instead lifting its club as it wentoy peabrain yelled ron from the other side of the chamber and he threw a metal pipe at it the troll didnt even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder but it heard the yell and paused again turning its ugly snout toward ron instead giving harry time to run around itcome on run run harry yelled at hermione trying to pull her toward the door but she couldnt move she was still flat against the wall her mouth open with terrorthe shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk it roared again and started toward ron who was nearest and had no way to escapeharry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid he took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the trolls neck from behind the troll couldnt feel harry hanging there but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose and harrys wand had still been in his hand when hed jumped it had gone straight up one of the trolls nostrilshowling with pain the troll twisted and flailed its club with harry clinging on for dear life any second the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the clubhermione had sunk to the floor in fright ron pulled out his own wand not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head wingardium leviosathe club flew suddenly out of the trolls hand rose high high up into the air turned slowly over and dropped with a sickening crack onto its owners head the troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face with a thud that made the whole room trembleharry got to his feet he was shaking and out of breath ron was standing there with his wand still raised staring at what he had doneit was hermione who spoke firstis it deadi dont think so said harry i think its just been knocked outhe bent down and pulled his wand out of the trolls nose it was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glueurgh troll boogershe wiped it on the trolls trousersa sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look upthey hadnt realized what a racket they had been making but of course someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the trolls roars a moment later professor mcgonagall had come bursting into the room closely followed by snape with quirrell bringing up the rear quirrell took one look at the troll let out a faint whimper and sat quickly down on a toilet clutching his heartsnape bent over the troll professor mcgonagall was looking at ron and harry harry had never seen her look so angry her lips were whitehopes of winning fifty points for gryffindor faded quickly from harrys mindwhat on earth were you thinking of said professor mcgonagall with cold fury in her voice harry looked at ron who was still standing with his wand in the air youre lucky you werent killed why arent you in your dormitorysnape gave harry a swift piercing look harry looked at the floor he wished ron would put his wand downthen a small voice came out of the shadowsplease professor mcgonagall they were looking for memiss grangerhermione had managed to get to her feet at lasti went looking for the troll because i i thought i could deal with it on my own you know because ive read all about themron dropped his wand hermione granger telling a downright lie to a teacher if they hadnt found me id be dead now harry stuck his wand up its nose and ron knocked it out with its own club they didnt have time to come and fetch anyone it was about to finish me off when they arrivedharry and ron tried to look as though this story wasnt new to themwell in that case said professor mcgonagall staring at the three of them miss granger you foolish girl how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your ownhermione hung her head harry was speechless hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules and here she was pretending she had to get them out of trouble it was as if snape had started handing out sweetsmiss granger five points will be taken from gryffindor for this said professor mcgonagall im very disappointed in you if youre not hurt at all youd better get off to gryffindor tower students are finishing the feast in their houseshermione leftprofessor mcgonagall turned to harry and ronwell i still say you were lucky but not many first years could have taken on a fullgrown mountain troll you each win gryffindor five points professor dumbledore will be informed of this you may gothey hurried out of the chamber and didnt speak at all until they had climbed two floors up it was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll quite apart from anything elsewe should have gotten more than ten points ron grumbledfive you mean once shes taken off hermionesgood of her to get us out of trouble like that ron admitted mind you we did save hershe might not have needed saving if we hadnt locked the thing in with her harry reminded himthey had reached the portrait of the fat ladypig snout they said and enteredthe common room was packed and noisy everyone was eating the food that had been sent up hermione however stood alone by the door waiting for them there was a very embarrassed pause then none of them looking at each other they all said thanks and hurried off to get platesbut from that moment on hermione granger became their friend there are some things you cant share without ending up liking each other and knocking out a twelvefoot mountain troll is one of themchapter elevenquidditchas they entered november the weather turned very cold the mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel every morning the ground was covered in frost hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the quidditch field bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat rabbit fur gloves and enormous beaverskin bootsthe quidditch season had begun on saturday harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training gryffindor versus slytherin if gryffindor won they would move up into second place in the house championshiphardly anyone had seen harry play because wood had decided that as their secret weapon harry should be kept well secret but the news that he was playing seeker had leaked out somehow and harry didnt know which was worse people telling him hed be brilliant or people telling him theyd be running around underneath him holding a mattressit was really lucky that harry now had hermlone as a friend he didnt know how hed have gotten through all his homework without her what with all the lastminute quidditch practice wood was making them do she had also tent him quidditch through the ages which turned out to be a very interesting readharry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a world cup match in that seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players and that most serious quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them that although people rarely died playing quidditch referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the sahara deserthermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since harry and ron had saved her from the mountain troll and she was much nicer for it the day before harrys first quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jarthey were standing with their backs to it getting warm when snape crossed the yard harry noticed at once that snape was limping harry ron and hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view they were sure it wouldnt be allowed unfortunately something about their guilty faces caught snapes eye he limped over he hadnt seen the fire but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anywaywhats that youve got there potterit was quidditch through the ages harry showed himlibrary books are not to be taken outside the school said snapegive it to me five points from gryffindorhes just made that rule up harry muttered angrily as snape limped away wonder whats wrong with his legdunno but i hope its really hurting him said ron bitterlythe gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening harry ron and hermione sat together next to a window hermione was checking harry and rons charms homework for them she would never let them copy how will you learn but by asking her to read it through they got the right answers anywayharry felt restless he wanted quidditch through the ages back to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow why should he be afraid of snape getting up he told ron and hermione he was going to ask snape if he could have itbetter you than me they said together but harry had an idea that snape wouldnt refuse if there were other teachers listeninghe made his way down to the staffroom and knocked there was no answerhe knocked again nothingperhaps snape had left the book in there it was worth a try he pushed the door ajar and peered inside and a horrible scene met his eyessnape and filch were inside alone snape was holding his robes above his knees one of his legs was bloody and mangled filch was handing snape bandagesblasted thing snape was saying how are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at onceharry tried to shut the door quietly but pottersnapes face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to hide his leg harry gulpedi just wondered if i could have my book backget out outharry left before snape could take any more points from gryffindor he sprinted back upstairsdid you get it ron asked as harry joined them whats the matterin a low whisper harry told them what hed seenyou know what this means he finished breathlessly he tried to get past that threeheaded dog at halloween thats where he was going when we saw him hes after whatever its guarding and id bet my broomstick he let that troll in to make a diversionhermiones eyes were wideno he wouldnt she said i know hes not very nice but he wouldnt try and steal something dumbledore was keeping safehonestly hermione you think all teachers are saints or somethingsnapped ron im with harry i wouldnt put anything past snape but whats he after whats that dog guardingharry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question neville was snoring loudly but harry couldnt sleep he tried to empty his mind he needed to sleep he had to he had his first quidditch match in a few hours but the expression on snapes face when harry had seen his leg wasnt easy to forgetthe next morning dawned very bright and cold the great hall was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheer ful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good quidditch matchyouve got to eat some breakfasti dont want anythingjust a bit of toast wheedled hermioneim not hungryharry felt terrible in an hours time hed be walking onto the fieldharry you need your strength said seamus finnigan seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other teamthanks seamus said harry watching seamus pile ketchup on his sausagesby eleven oclock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the quidditch pitch many students had binoculars the seats might be raised high in the air but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimesron and hermione joined neville seamus and dean the west ham fan up in the top row as a surprise for harry they had painted a large banner on one of the sheets scabbers had ruined it said potter for president and dean who was good at drawing had done a large gryffindor lion underneath then hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different colorsmeanwhile in the locker room harry and the rest of the team were changing into their scarlet quidditch robes slytherin would be playing in greenwood cleared his throat for silenceokay men he saidand women said chaser angelina johnsonand women wood agreed this is itthe big one said fred weasleythe one weve all been waiting for said georgewe know olivers speech by heart fred told harry we were on the team last yearshut up you two said wood this is the best team gryffindors had in years were going to win i know ithe glared at them all as if to say or elseright its time good luck all of youharry followed fred and george out of the locker room and hoping his knees werent going to give way walked onto the field to loud cheersmadam hooch was refereeing she stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams her broom in her handnow i want a nice fair game all of you she said once they were all gathered around her harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the slytherin captain marcus flint a sixth year harry thought flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above flashing potter for president over the crowd his heart skipped he felt bravermount your brooms pleaseharry clambered onto his nimbus two thousandmadam hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistlefifteen brooms rose up high high into the air they were off and the quaffle is taken immediately by angelina johnson of gryffindor what an excellent chaser that girl is and rather attractive too jordansorry professorthe weasley twins friend lee jordan was doing the commentary for the match closely watched by professor mcgonagalland shes really belting along up there a neat pass to alicia spinnet a good find of oliver woods last year only a reserve back to johnson and no the slytherins have taken the quaffle slytherin captain marcus flint gains the quaffle and off he goes flint flying like an eagle up there hes going to sc no stopped by an excellent move by gryffindor keeper wood and the

the slytherins thats adrian pucey speeding off toward the goal posts but hes blocked by a second bludger sent his way by fred or george weasley cant tell which nice play by the gryffindor beater anyway and johnson back in possession of the quaffle a clear field ahead and off she goes shes really flying dodges a speeding bludger the goal posts are ahead come on now angelina keeper bletchley dives misses gryffindors scoregryffindor cheers filled the cold air with howls and moans from the slytherinsbudge up there move alonghagridron and hermione squeezed together to give hagrid enough space to join thembin watchin from me hut said hagrid patting a large pair of binoculars around his neck but it isnt the same as bein in the crowd no sign of the snitch yet ehnope said ron harry hasnt had much to do yetkept outta trouble though thats somethin said hagrid raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was harryway up above them harry was gliding over the game squinting about for some sign of the snitch this was part of his and woods game plankeep out of the way until you catch sight of the snitch wood had said we dont want you attacked before you have to bewhen angelina had scored harry had done a couple of looptheloops to let off his feelings now he was back to staring around for the snitchonce he caught sight of a flash of gold but it was just a reflection from one of the weasleys wristwatches and once a bludger decided to come pelting his way more like a cannonball than anything but harry dodged it and fred weasley came chasing after itall right there harry he had time to yell as he beat the bludger furiously toward marcus flintslytherin in possession lee jordan was saying chaser pucey ducks two bludgers two weasleys and chaser bell and speeds toward the wait a moment was that the snitcha murmur ran through the crowd as adrian pucey dropped the quaffle too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left earharry saw it in a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the streak of gold slytherin seeker terence higgs had seen it too neck and neck they hurtled toward the snitch all the chasers seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to watchharry was faster than higgs he could see the little round ball wings fluttering darting up ahead he put on an extra spurt of speed wham a roar of rage echoed from the gryffindors below marcus flint had blocked harry on purpose and harrys broom spun off course harry holding on for dear lifefoul screamed the gryffindorsmadam hooch spoke angrily to flint and then ordered a free shot at the goal posts for gryffindor but in all the confusion of course the golden snitch had disappeared from sight againdown in the stands dean thomas was yelling send him off ref red cardwhat are you talking about dean said ronred card said dean furiously in soccer you get shown the red card and youre out of the gamebut this isnt soccer dean ron reminded himhagrid however was on deans sidethey oughta change the rules flint coulda knocked harry outta the airlee jordan was finding it difficult not to take sidesso after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating jordan growled professor mcgonagalli mean after that open and revolting foul jordan im warning you all right all right flint nearly kills the gryffindor seeker which could happen to anyone im sure so a penalty to gryffindor taken by spinner who puts it away no trouble and we continue play gryffindor still in possessionit was as harry dodged another bludger which went spinning dangerously past his head that it happened his broom gave a sudden frightening lurch for a split second he thought he was going to fall he gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and knees hed never felt anything like thatit happened again it was as though the broom was trying to buck him off but nimbus two thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off harry tried to turn back toward the gryffindor goal posts he had half a mind to ask wood to call timeout and then he realized that his broom was completely out of his control he couldnt turn it he couldnt direct it at all it was zigzagging through the air and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated himlee was still commentatingslytherin in possession flint with the quaffle passes spinnet passes bell hit hard in the face by a bludger hope it broke his nose only joking professor slytherins score a nothe slytherins were cheering no one seemed to have noticed that harrys broom was behaving strangely it was carrying him slowly higher away from the game jerking and twitching as it wentdunno what harry thinks hes doing hagrid mumbled he stared through his binoculars if i didn know better id say hed lost control of his broom but he cant havesuddenly people were pointing up at harry all over the stands his broom had started to roll over and over with him only just managing to hold on then the whole crowd gasped harrys broom had given a wild jerk and harry swung off it he was now dangling from it holding on with only one handdid something happen to it when flint blocked him seamus whisperedcant have hagrid said his voice shaking cant nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful dark magic no kid could do that to a nimbus two thousandat these words hermione seized hagrids binoculars but instead of looking up at harry she started looking frantically at the crowdwhat are you doing moaned ron grayfacedi knew it hermione gasped snape lookron grabbed the binoculars snape was in the middle of the stands opposite them he had his eyes fixed on harry and was muttering nonstop under his breathhes doing something jinxing the broom said hermionewhat should we doleave it to mebefore ron could say another word hermione had disappeared ron turned the binoculars back on harry his broom was vibrating so hard it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer the whole crowd was on its feet watching terrified as the weasleys flew up to try and pull harry safely onto one of their brooms but it was no good every time they got near him the broom would jump higher still they dropped lower and circled beneath him obviously hoping to catch him if he fellmarcus flint seized the quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticingcome on hermione ron muttered desperatelyhermione had fought her way across to the stand where snape stood and was now racing along the row behind him she didnt even stop to say sorry as she knocked professor quirrell headfirst into the row in frontreaching snape she crouched down pulled out her wand and whispered a few well chosen words bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of snapes robesit took perhaps thirty seconds for snape to realize that he was on firea sudden yelp told her she had done her job scooping the fire off him into a little jar in her pocket she scrambled back along the row snape would never know what had happenedit was enough up in the air harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broomneville you can look ron said neville had been sobbing into hagrids jacket for the last five minutesharry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick he hit the field on all fours coughed and something gold fell into his handive got the snitch he shouted waving it above his head and the game ended in complete confusionhe didnt catch it he nearly swallowed it flint was still howling twenty minutes later but it made no difference harry hadnt broken any rules and lee jordan was still happily shouting the results gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty harry heard none of this though he was being made a cup of strong tea back in hagrids hut with ron and hermioneit was snape ron was explaining hermione and i saw him he was cursing your broomstick muttering he wouldnt take his eyes off yourubbish said hagrid who hadnt heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stands why would snape do somethin like thatharry ron and hermione looked at one another wondering what to tell him harry decided on the truthi found out something about him he told hagrid he tried to get past that threeheaded dog on halloween it bit him we think he was trying to steal whatever its guardinghagrid dropped the teapothow do you know about fluffy he saidfluffyyeah hes mine bought him off a greek chappie i met in the pub las year i lent him to dumbledore to guard the yes said harry eagerlynow dont ask me anymore said hagrid gruffly thats top secret that isbut snapes trying to steal itrubbish said hagrid again snapes a hogwarts teacher hed do nothin of the sortso why did he just try and kill harry cried hermionethe afternoons events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about snapei know a jinx when i see one hagrid ive read all about them youve got to keep eye contact and snape wasnt blinking at all i saw himim tellin yeh yer wrong said hagrid hotly i don know why harrys broom acted like that but snape wouldn try an kill a student now listen to me all three of yeh yer meddlin in things that don concern yeh its dangerous you forget that dog an you forget what its guardin thats between professor dumbledore an nicolas flamel aha said harry so theres someone called nicolas flamel involved is therehagrid looked furious with himselfchapter twelvethe mirror of erisedchristmas was coming one morning in middecember hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow the lake froze solid and the weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed quirrell around bouncing off the back of his turban the few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by hagrid before they could fly off againno one could wait for the holidays to start while the gryffindor common room and the great hall had roaring fires the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classroomsworst of all were professor snapes classes down in the dungeons where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldronsi do feel so sorry said draco malfoy one potions class for all those people who have to stay at hogwarts for christmas because theyre not wanted at homehe was looking over at harry as he spoke crabbe and goyle chuckledharry who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish ignored themmalfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the quidditch match disgusted that the slytherins had lost he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a widemouthed tree frog would be replacing harry as seeker next then hed realized that nobody found this funny because they were all so impressed at the way harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick so malfoy jealous and angry had gone back to taunting harry about having no proper familyit was true that harry wasnt going back to privet drive for christmasprofessor mcgonagall had come around the week before making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays and harry had signed up at once he didnt feel sorry for himself at all this would probably be the best christmas hed ever had ron and his brothers were staying too because mr and mrs weasley were going to romania to visit charliewhen they left the dungeons at the end of potions they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that hagrid was behind ithi hagrid want any help ron asked sticking his head through the branchesnah im all right thanks ronwould you mind moving out of the way came malfoys cold drawl from behind them are you trying to earn some extra money weasley hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave hogwarts i suppose that hut of hagrids must seem like a palace compared to what your familys used toron dived at malfoy just as snape came up the stairsweasleyron let go of the front of malfoys robeshe was provoked professor snape said hagrid sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree malfoy was insultin his familybe that as it may fighting is against hogwarts rules hagrid said snape silkily five points from gryffindor weasley and be grateful it isnt more move along all of youmalfoy crabbe and goyle pushed roughly past the tree scattering needles everywhere and smirkingill get him said ron grinding his teeth at malfoys back one of these days ill get him i hate them both said harry malfoy and snapecome on cheer up its nearly christmas said hagrid tell yeh what come with me an see the great hall looks a treatso the three of them followed hagrid and his tree off to the great hall where professor mcgonagall and professor flitwick were busy with the christmas decorationsah hagrid the last tree put it in the far corner would youthe hall looked spectacular festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls and no less than twelve towering christmas trees stood around the room some sparkling with tiny icicles some glittering with hundreds of candleshow many days you got left until yer holidays hagrid askedjust one said hermione and that reminds me harry ron weve got half an hour before lunch we should be in the libraryoh yeah youre right said ron tearing his eyes away from professor flitwick who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new treethe library said hagrid following them out of the hall just before the holidays bit keen arent yehoh were not working harry told him brightly ever since you mentioned nicolas flamel weve been trying to find out who he isyou what hagrid looked shocked listen here ive told yeh drop it its nothin to you what that dogs guardinwe just want to know who nicolas flamel is thats all said hermioneunless youd like to tell us and save us the trouble harry added we mustve been through hundreds of books already and we cant find him anywhere just give us a hint i know ive read his name somewhereim sayin nothin said hagrid flatlyjust have to find out for ourselves then said ron and they left hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the librarythey had indeed been searching books for flamels name ever since hagrid had let it slip because how else were they going to find out what snape was trying to steal the trouble was it was very hard to know where to begin not knowing what flamel might have done to get himself into a book he wasnt in great wizards of the twentieth century or notable magical names of our time he was missing too from important modern magical discoveries and a study of recent developments in wizardry and then of course there was the sheer size of the library tens of thousands of books thousands of shelves hundreds of narrow rowshermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random harry wandered over to the restricted section he had been wondering for a while if flamel wasnt somewhere in there unfortunately you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books and he knew hed never get one these were the books containing powerful dark magic never taught at hogwarts and only read by older students studying advanced defense against the dark artswhat are you looking for boynothing said harrymadam pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at himyoud better get out then go on outwishing hed been a bit quicker at thinking up some story harry left the library he ron and hermione had already agreed theyd better not ask madam pince where they could find flamel they were sure shed be able to tell them but they couldnt risk snape hearing what they were up toharry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything but he wasnt very hopeful they had been looking for two weeks after a but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasnt surprising theyd found nothing what they really needed was a nice long search without madam pince breathing down their necksfive minutes later ron and hermione joined him shaking their headsthey went off to lunchyou will keep looking while im away wont you said hermione and send me an owl if you find anythingand you could ask your parents if they know who flamel is said ronitd be safe to ask themvery safe as theyre both dentists said hermioneonce the holidays had started ron and harry were having too good a time to think much about flamel they had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire they sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork bread english muffins marshmallows and plotting ways of getting malfoy expelled which were fun to talk about even if they wouldnt workron also started teaching harry wizard chess this was exactly like muggle chess except that the figures were alive which made it a lot like directing troops in battle rons set was very old and batteredlike everything else he owned it had once belonged to someone else in his family in this case his grandfather however old chessmen werent a drawback at all ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wantedharry played with chessmen seamus finnigan had lent him and they didnt trust him at all he wasnt a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him which was confusing dont send me there cant you see his knight send him we can afford to lose him on christmas eve harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun but not expecting any presents at allwhen he woke early in the morning however the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bedmerry christmas said ron sleepily as harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobeyou too said harry will you look at this ive got some presentswhat did you expect turnips said ron turning to his own pile which was a lot bigger than harrysharry picked up the top parcel it was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was to harry from hagrid inside was a roughly cut wooden flute hagrid had obviously whittled it himself harry blew it it sounded a bit like an owla second very small parcel contained a notewe received your message and enclose your christmas present from uncle vernon and aunt petunia taped to the note was a fiftypence piecethats friendly said harryron was fascinated by the fifty penceweird he said nmat a shape this is moneyyou can keep it said harry laughing at how pleased ron was hagrid and my aunt and uncle so who sent thesei think i know who that ones from said ron turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel my mom i told her you didnt expect any presents and oh no he groaned shes made you a weasley sweaterharry had torn open the parcel to find a thick handknitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudgeevery year she makes us a sweater said ron unwrapping his own and mines always maroonthats really nice of her said harry trying the fudge which was very tastyhis next present also contained candy a large box of chocolate frogs from hermionethis only left one parcel harry picked it up and felt it it was very light he unwrapped itsomething fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds ron gaspedive heard of those he said in a hushed voice dropping the box of every flavor beans hed gotten from hermione if thats what i think it is theyre really rare and really valuablewhat is itharry picked the shining silvery cloth off the floor it was strange to the touch like water woven into materialits an invisibility cloak said ron a look of awe on his face im sure it is try it onharry threw the cloak around his shoulders and ron gave a yellit is look downharry looked down at his feet but they were gone he dashed to the mirror sure enough his reflection looked back at him just his head suspended in midair his body completely invisible he pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completelytheres a note said ron suddenly a note fell out of itharry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter written in narrow loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words your father left this in my possession before he died it is time it was returned to you use it wella very merry christmas to youthere was no signature harry stared at the note ron was admiring the cloakid give anything for one of these he said anything whats the matternothing said harry he felt very strange who had sent the cloak had it really once belonged to his father before he could say or think anything else the dormitory door was flung open and fred and george weasley bounded in harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight he didnt feel like sharing it with anyone else yetmerry christmashey look harrys got a weasley sweater toofred and george were wearing blue sweaters one with a large yellow f on it the other a gharrys is better than ours though said fred holding up harrys sweater she obviously makes more of an effort if youre not familywhy arent you wearing yours ron george demanded come on get it on theyre lovely and warmi hate maroon ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his headyou havent got a letter on yours george observed i suppose she thinks you dont forget your name but were not stupid we know were called gred and forgewhats all th is noisepercy weasley stuck his head through the door looking disapproving he had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he too carried a lumpy sweater over his arm which fred seizedp for prefect get it on percy come on were all wearing ours even harry got onei dont want said percy thickly as the twins forced the sweater over his head knocking his glasses askewand youre not sitting with the prefects today either said george christmas is a time for familythey frogmarched percy from the room his arms pinned to his side by his sweaterharry had never in all his life had such a christmas dinner a hundred fat roast turkeys mountains of roast and boiled potatoes platters of chipolatas tureens of buttered peas silver boats of thick rich gravy and cranberry sauce and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table these fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble muggle ones the dursleys usually bought with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside harry pulled a wizard cracker with fred and it didnt just bang it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke while from the inside exploded a rear admirals hat and several live white mice up at the high table dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizards hat for a flowered bonnet and was chuckling merrily at a joke professor flitwick had just read himflaming christmas puddings followed the turkey percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice harry watched hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine finally kissing professor mcgonagall on the cheek who to harrys amazement giggled and blushed her top hat lopsidedwhen harry finally left the table he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers including a pack of nonexplodable luminous balloons a growyourownwarts kit and his own new wizard chess setthe white mice had disappeared and harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as mrs norriss christmas dinnerharry and the weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds then cold wet and gasping for breath they returned to the fire in the gryffindor common room where harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to ron he suspected he wouldnt have lost so badly if percy hadnt tried to help him so muchafter a meal of turkey sandwiches crumpets trifle and christmas cake everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch percy chase fred and george all over gryffindor tower because theyd stolen his prefect badgeit had been harrys best christmas day ever yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it the invisibility cloak and whoever had sent itron full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him fell asleep almost as soon as hed drawn the curtains of his fourposter harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under ithis fathers this had been his fathers he let the material flow over his hands smoother than silk light as air use it well the note had saidhe had to try it now he slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself looking down at his legs he saw only moonlight and shadows it was a very funny feelinguse it wellsuddenly harry felt wideawake the whole of hogwarts was open to him in this cloak excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark and silence he could go anywhere in this anywhere and filch would never knowron grunted in his sleep should harry wake him something held him back his fathers cloak he felt that this time the first time he wanted to use it alonehe crept out of the dormitory down the stairs across the common room and climbed through the portrait holewhos there squawked the fat lady harry said nothing he walked quickly down the corridorwhere should he go he stopped his heart racing and thought and then it came to him the restricted section in the library hed be able to read as long as he liked as long as it took to find out who flamel washe set off drawing the invisibility cloak tight around him as he walkedthe library was pitchblack and very eerie harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books the lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair and even though harry could feel his arm supporting it the sight gave him the creepsthe restricted section was right at the back of the library step ping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library he held up his lamp to read the titlesthey didnt tell him much their peeling faded gold letters spelled words in languages harry couldnt understand some had no title at allone book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood the hairs on the back of harrys neck prickled maybe he was imagining it maybe not but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books as though they knew someone was there who shouldnt behe had to start somewhere setting the lamp down carefully on the floor he looked along the bottom shelf for an interestinglooking book a large black and silver volume caught his eye he pulled it out with difficulty because it was very heavy and balancing it on his knee let it fall opena piercing bloodcurdling shriek split the silence the book was screaming harry snapped it shut but the shriek went on and on one high unbroken earsplitting note he stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp which went out at once panicking he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf he ran for it he passed filch in the doorway filchs pale wild eyes looked straight through him and harry slipped under filchs outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor the books shrieks still ringing in his earshe came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor he had been so busy getting away from the library he hadnt paid attention to where he was going perhaps because it was dark he didnt recognize where he was at all there was a suit of armor near the kitchens he knew but he must be five floors above thereyou asked me to come directly to you professor if anyone was wandering around at night and somebodys been in the library restricted sectionharry felt the blood drain out of his face wherever he was filch must know a shortcut because his soft greasy voice was getting nearer and to his horror it was snape who replied the restricted section well they cant be far well catch themharry stood rooted to the spot as filch and snape came around the corner ahead they couldnt see him of course but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer theyd knock right into him the cloak didnt stop him from being solidhe backed away as quietly as he could a door stood ajar to his left it was his only hope he squeezed through it holding his breath trying not to move it and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything they walked straight past and harry leaned against the wall breathing deeply listening to their footsteps dying away that had been close very close it was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden init looked like an unused classroom the dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls and there was an upturned wastepaper basket but propped against the wall facing him was something that didnt look as if it belonged there something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the wayit was a magnificent mirror as high as the ceiling with an ornate gold frame standing on two clawed feet there was an inscription carved around the top erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi his panic fading now that there was no sound of filch and snape harry moved nearer to the mirror wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again he stepped in front of ithe had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming he whirled around his heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed for he had seen not only himself in the mirror but a whole crowd of people standing right behind himbut the room was empty breathing very fast he turned slowly back to the mirrorthere he was reflected in it white and scaredlooking and there reflected behind him were at least ten others harry looked over his shoulder but still no one was there or were they all invisible too was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirrors trick was that it reflected them invisible or not he looked in the mirror again a woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving he reached out a hand and felt the air behind him if she was really there hed touch her their reflections were so close together but he felt only air she and the others existed only in the mirrorshe was a very pretty woman she had dark red hair and her eyes her eyes are just like mine harry thought edging a little closer to the glass bright green exactly the same shape but then he noticed that she was crying smiling but crying at the same time the tall thin blackhaired man standing next to her put his arm around her he wore glasses and his hair was very untidy it stuck up at the back just as harrys didharry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflectionmom he whispered dadthey just looked at him smiling and slowly harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror and saw other pairs of green eyes like his other noses like his even a little old man who looked as though he had harrys knobbly knees harry was looking at his family for the first time in his lifethe potters smiled and waved at harry and he stared hungrily back at them his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them he had a powerful kind of ache inside him half joy half terrible sadnesshow long he stood there he didnt know the reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses he couldnt stay here he had to find his way back to bed he tore his eyes away from his mothers face whispered ill come backand hurried from the roomyou could have woken me up said ron crosslyyou can come tonight im going back i want to show you the mirrorid like to see your mom and dad ron said eagerlyand i want to see all your family all the weasleys youll be able to show me your other brothers and everyoneyou can see them any old time said ron just come round my house this summer anyway maybe it only shows dead people shame about not finding flamel though have some bacon or something why arent you eating anythingharry couldnt eat he had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight he had almost forgotten about flamel it didnt seem very important anymore who cared what the three headed dog was guarding what did it matter if snape stole it really are you all right said ron you look oddwhat harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again with ron covered in the cloak too they had to walk much more slowly the next night they tried retracing harrys route from the library wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hourim freezing said ron lets forget it and go backno harry hissed i know its here somewherethey passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction but saw no one else just as ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold harry spotted the suit of armorits here just here yesthey pushed the door open harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirrorthere they were his mother and father beamed at the sight of himsee harry whisperedi cant see anythinglook look at them all there are loads of themi can only see youlook in it properly go on stand where i amharry stepped aside but with ron in front of the mirror he couldnt see his family anymore just ron in his paisley pajamasron though was staring transfixed at his imagelook at me he saidcan you see all your family standing around youno im alone but im different i look older and im head boywhati am im wearing the badge like bill used to and im holding the house cup and the quidditch cup im quidditch captain tooron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at harrydo you think this mirror shows the futurehow can it all my family are dead let me have another look you had it to yourself all last night give me a bit more timeyoure only holding the quidditch cup whats interesting about that i want to see my parentsdont push me a sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussionthey hadnt realized how loudly they had been talkingquickron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of mrs norris came round the door ron and harry stood quite still both thinking the same thing did the cloak work on cats after what seemed an age she turned and leftthis isnt safe she might have gone for filch i bet she heard uscome onand ron pulled harry out of the roomthe snow still hadnt melted the next morningwant to play chess harry said ronnowhy dont we go down and visit hagridno you goi know what youre thinking about harry that mirror dont go back tonightwhy noti dunno ive just got a bad feeling about it and anyway youve had too many close shaves already filch snape and mrs norris are wandering around so what if they cant see you what if they walk into you what if you knock something overyou sound like hermioneim serious harry dont gobut harry only had one thought in his head which was to get back in front of the mirror and ron wasnt going to stop himthat third night he found his way more quickly than before he was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise but he didnt meet anyoneand there were his mother and father smiling at him again and one of his grandfathers nodding happily harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror there was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family nothing at allexcept so back again harryharry felt as though his insides had turned to ice he looked behind him sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than albus dumbledore harry must have walked straight past him so desperate to get to the mirror he hadnt noticed himi didnt see you sirstrange how nearsighted being invisible can make you said dumbledore and harry was relieved to see that he was smilingso said dumbledore slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with harry you like hundreds before you have discovered the delights of the mirror of erisedi didnt know it was called that sirbut i expect youve realized by now what it doesit well it shows me my family and it showed your friend ron himself as head boyhow did you know i dont need a cloak to become invisible said dumbledore gentlynow can you think what the mirror of erised shows us allharry shook his headlet me explain the happiest man on earth would be able to use the mirror of erised like a normal mirror that is he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is does that helpharry thought then he said slowly it shows us what we wantwhatever we wantyes and no said dumbledore quietly it shows us nothing more or less than the deepest most desperate desire of our hearts you who have never known your family see them standing around you ronald weasley who has always been overshadowed by his brothers sees himself standing alone the best of all of them however this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth men have wasted away before it entranced by what they have seen or been driven mad not knowing if what it shows is real or even possiblethe mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow harry and i ask you not to go looking for it again if you ever do run across it you will now be prepared it does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live remember that now why dont you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bedharry stood upsir professor dumbledore can i ask you somethingobviously youve just done so dumbledore smiled you may ask me one more thing howeverwhat do you see when you look in the mirrori i see myself holding a pair of thick woolen socksharry staredone can never have enough socks said dumbledore another christmas has come and gone and i didnt get a single pair people will insist on giving me booksit was only when he was back in bed that it struck harry that dumbledore might not have been quite truthful but then he thought as he shoved scabbers off his pillow it had been quite a personal questionchapter thirteennicolas flameldumbledore had convinced harry not to go looking for the mirror of erised again and for the rest of the christmas holidays the invisibility cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk harry wished he could forget what hed seen in the mirror as easily but he couldnt he started having nightmares over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light while a high voice cackled with laughteryou see dumbledore was right that mirror could drive you mad said ron when harry told him about these drearnshermione who came back the day before term started took a different view of things she was torn between horror at the idea of harry being out of bed roaming the school three nights in a row if filch had caught you and disappointment that he hadnt at least found out who nicolas flamel wasthey had almost given up hope of ever finding flamel in a li brary book even though harry was still sure hed read the name somewhereonce term had started they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks harry had even less time than the other two because quidditch practice had started againwood was working the team harder than ever even the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldnt dampen his spirits the weasleys complained that wood was becoming a fanatic but harry was on woods side if they won their next match against hufflepuff they would overtake slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven years quite apart from wanting to win harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after trainingthen during one particularly wet and muddy practice session wood gave the team a bit of bad news hed just gotten very angry with the weasleys who kept divebombing each other and pretending to fall off their broomswill you stop messing around he yelled thats exactly the sort of thing thatll lose us the match snapes refereeing this time and hell be looking for any excuse to knock points off gryffindorgeorge weasley really did fall off his broom at these wordssnapes refereeing he spluttered through a mouthful of mud whens he ever refereed a quidditch match hes not going to be fair if we might overtake slytherinthe rest of the team landed next to george to complain tooits not my fault said wood weve just got to make sure we play a clean game so snape hasnt got an excuse to pick on uswhich was all very well thought harry but he had another reason for not wanting snape near him while he was playing quidditchthe rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice but harry headed straight back to the gryffindor common room where he found ron and hermione playing chess chess was the only thing hermione ever lost at something harry and ron thought was very good for herdont talk to me for a moment said ron when harry sat down next to him i need to concen he caught sight of harrys face whats the matter with you you look terriblespeaking quietly so that no one else would hear harry told the other two about snapes sudden sinister desire to be a quidditch refereedont play said hermione at oncesay youre ill said ronpretend to break your leg hermione suggestedreally break your leg said roni cant said harry there isnt a reserve seeker if i back out gryffindor cant play at allat that moment neville toppled into the common room how he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyones guess because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the leglocker curse he must have had to bunny hop all the way up to gryffindor towereveryone fell over laughing except hermione who leapt up and performed the countercurse nevilles legs sprang apart and he got to his feet trembling what happened hermione asked him leading him over to sit with harry and ronmalfoy said neville shakily i met him outside the library he said hed been looking for someone to practice that ongo to professor mcgonagall hermione urged neville report himneville shook his headi dont want more trouble he mumbledyouve got to stand up to him neville said ron hes used to walking all over people but thats no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easiertheres no need to tell me im not brave enough to be in gryffindor malfoys already done that neville choked outharry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a chocolate frog the very last one from the box hermione had given him for christmas he gave it to neville who looked as though he might cryyoure worth twelve of malfoy harry said the sorting hat chose you for gryffindor didnt it and wheres malfoy in stinking slytherinnevilles lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frogthanks harry i think ill go to bed dyou want the card you collect them dont youas neville walked away harry looked at the famous wizard carddumbledore again he said he was the first one i everhe gasped he stared at the back of the card then he looked up at ron and hermioneive found him he whispered ive found flamel i told you id read the name somewhere before i read it on the train coming here listen to this dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard grindelwald in for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragons blood and his work on alchemy with his partner nicolas flamelhermione jumped to her feet she hadnt looked so excited since theyd gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homeworkstay there she said and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls dormitories harry and ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back an enormous old book in her armsi never thought to look in here she whispered excitedly i got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light readinglight said ron but hermione told him to be quiet until shed looked something up and started flicking frantically through the pages muttering to herselfat last she found what she was looking fori knew it i knew itare we allowed to speak yet said ron grumpily hermione ignored himnicolas flamel she whispered dramatically is the only known maker of the sorcerers stonethis didnt have quite the effect shed expectedthe what said harry and ronoh honestly dont you two read look read that thereshe pushed the book toward them and harry and ron read the ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the sorcerers stone a legendary substance with astonishing powers the stone will transform any metal into pure gold it also produces the elixir of life which will make the drinker immortalthere have been many reports of the sorcerers stone over the centuries but the only stone currently in existence belongs to mr nicolas flamel the noted alchemist and opera lover mr flamel who celebrated his six hundred and sixtyfifth birthday last year enjoys a quiet life in devon with his wife perenelle six hundred and fiftyeightsee said hermione when harry and ron had finished the dog must be guarding flamels sorcerers stone i bet he asked dumbledore to keep it safe for him because theyre friends and he knew someone was after it thats why he wanted the stone moved out of gringottsa stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying said harry no wonder snapes after it anyone would want itand no wonder we couldnt find flamel in that study of recent developments in wizardry said ron hes not exactly recent if hes six hundred and sixtyfive is hethe next morning in defense against the dark arts while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites harry and ron were still discussing what theyd do with a sorcerers stone if they had one it wasnt until ron said hed buy his own quidditch team that harry remembered about snape and the coming matchim going to play he told ron and hermione if i dont all the slytherins will think im just too scared to face snape ill show them itll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we winjust as long as were not wiping you off the field said hermioneas the match drew nearer however harry became more and more nervous whatever he told ron and hermione the rest of the team wasnt too calm either the idea of overtaking slytherin in the house championship was wonderful no one had done it for seven years but would they be allowed to with such a biased referee harry didnt know whether he was imagining it or not but he seemed to keep running into snape wherever he went at times he even wondered whether snape was following him trying to catch him on his own potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture snape was so horrible to harry could snape possibly know theyd found out about the sorcerers stone harry didnt see how he could yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that snape could read mindsharry knew when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon that ron and hermione were wondering whether theyd ever see him alive again this wasnt what youd call comforting harry hardly heard a word of woods pep talk as he pulled on his quidditch robes and picked up his nimbus two thousandron and hermione meanwhile had found a place in the stands next to neville who couldnt understand why they looked so grim and worried or why they had both brought their wands to the match little did harry know that ron and hermione had been secretly practicing the leglocker curse theyd gotten the idea from malfoy using it on neville and were ready to use it on snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt harrynow dont forget its locomotor mortis hermione muttered as ron slipped his wand up his sleevei know ron snapped dont nagback in the locker room wood had taken harry asidedont want to pressure you potter but if we ever need an early capture of the snitch its now finish the game before snape can favor hufflepuff too muchthe whole schools out there said fred weasley peering out of the door even blimey dumbledores come to watchharrys heart did a somersaultdumbledore he said dashing to the door to make sure fred was rightthere was no mistaking that silver beardharry could have laughed out loud with relief he was safe there was simply no way that snape would dare to try to hurt him if dumbledore was watchingperhaps that was why snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field something that ron noticed tooive never seen snape look so mean he told hermione look theyre off ouchsomeone had poked ron in the back of the head it was malfoyoh sorry weasley didnt see you theremalfoy grinned broadly at crabbe and goylewonder how long potters going to stay on his broom this time anyone want a bet what about you weasleyron didnt answer snape had just awarded hufflepuff a penalty because george weasley had hit a bludger at him hermione who had all her fingers crossed in her lap was squinting fixedly at harry who was circling the game like a hawk looking for the snitchyou know how i think they choose people for the gryffindor team said malfoy loudly a few minutes later as snape awarded hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all its people they feel sorry for see theres potter whos got no parents then theres the weasleys whove got no money you should be on the team longbottom youve got no brainsneville went bright red but turned in his seat to face malfoyim worth twelve of you malfoy he stammeredmalfoy crabbe and goyle howled with laughter but ron still not daring to take his eyes from the game said you tell him nevillelongbottom if brains were gold youd be poorer than weasley and thats saying somethingrons nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about harryim warning you malfoy one more word ron said hermione suddenly harry what whereharry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd hermione stood up her crossed fingers in her mouth as harry streaked toward the ground like a bulletyoure in luck weasley potters obviously spotted some money on the ground said malfoyron snapped before malfoy knew what was happening ron was on top of him wrestling him to the ground neville hesitated then clambered over the back of his seat to helpcome on harry hermione screamed leaping onto her seat to watch as harry sped straight at snape she didnt even notice malfoy and ron rolling around under her seat or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was neville crabbe and goyleup in the air snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him missing him by inches the next second harry had pulled out of the dive his arm raised in triumph the snitch clasped in his handthe stands erupted it had to be a record no one could ever remember the snitch being caught so quicklyron ron where are you the games over harrys won weve won gryffindor is in the lead shrieked hermione dancing up and down on her seat and hugging parvati patil in the row in frontharry jumped off his broom a foot from the ground he couldnt believe it hed done it the game was over it had barely lasted five minutes as gryffindors came spilling onto the field he saw snape land nearby whitefaced and tightlipped then harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into dumbledores smiling facewell done said dumbledore quietly so that only harry could hearnice to see you havent been brooding about that mirror been keeping busy excellentsnape spat bitterly on the groundharry left the locker room alone some time later to take his nimbus two thousand back to the broomshed he couldnt ever remember feeling happier hed really done something to be proud of now no one could say he was just a famous name any more the evening air had never smelled so sweet he walked over the damp grass reliving the last hour in his head which was a happy blur gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders ron and hermione in the distance jumping up and down ron cheering through a heavy nosebleedharry had reached the shed he leaned against the wooden door and looked up at hogwarts with its windows glowing red in the setting sungryffindor in the lead hed done it hed shown snapeand speaking of snapea hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle clearly not wanting to be seen it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest harrys victory faded from his mind as he watched he recognized the figures prowling walk snape sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner what was going on harry jumped back on his nimbus two thousand and took off gliding silently over the castle he saw snape enter the forest at a run he followedthe trees were so thick he couldnt see where snape had gone he flew in circles lower and lower brushing the top branches of trees until he heard voices he glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering beech treehe climbed carefully along one of the branches holding tight to his broomstick trying to see through the leaves below in a shadowy clearing stood snape but he wasnt alone quirrell was there tooharry couldnt make out the look on his face but he was stuttering worse than ever harry strained to catch what they were sayingddont know why you wanted ttto meet here of all pplaces severusoh i thought wed keep this private said snape his voice icystudents arent supposed to know about the sorcerers stone after allharry leaned forward quirrell was mumbling something snape interrupted himhave you found out how to get past that beast of hagrids yetbbbut severus i you dont want me as your enemy quirrell said snape taking a step toward himii dont know what you you know perfectly well what i meanan owl hooted loudly and harry nearly fell out of the tree he steadied himself in time to hear snape say your little bit of hocuspocusim waitingbbut i dddont very well snape cut in well have another little chat soon when youve had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties liehe threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing it was almost dark now but harry could see quirrell standing quite still as though he was petrifiedharry where have you been hermione squeakedwe won you won we won shouted ron thumping harry on the back and i gave malfoy a black eye and neville tried to take on crabbe and goyle singlehanded hes still out cold but madam pomftey says hell be all right talk about showing slytherin everyones waiting for you in the common room were having a party fred and george stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchensnever mind that now said harry breathlessly lets find an empty room you wait til you hear thishe made sure peeves wasnt inside before shutting the door behind them then he told them what hed seen and heardso we were right it is the sorcerers stone and snapes trying to force quirrell to help him get it he asked if he knew how to get past fluffy and he said something about quirrells hocus pocuss i reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from fluffy loads of enchantments probably and quirrell would have done some antidark arts spell that snape needs to break through so you mean the stones only safe as long as quirrell stands up to snape said hermione in alarmitll be gone by next tuesday said ronchapter fourteennorbert the norwegian ridgebackquirrell however must have been braver than theyd thought in the weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner but it didnt look as though hed cracked yetevery time they passed the thirdfloor corridor harry ron and hermione would press their ears to the door to check that fluffy was still growling inside snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper which surely meant that the stone was still safe whenever harry passed quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile and ron had started telling people off for laughing at quirrells stutterhermione however had more on her mind than the sorcerers stone she had started drawing up study schedules and colorcoding all her notesharry and ron wouldnt have minded but she kept nagging them to do the samehermione the exams are ages awayten weeks hermione snapped thats not ages thats like a second to nicolas flamelbut were not six hundred years old ron reminded her anyway what are you studying for you already know it awhat am i studying for are you crazy you realize we need to pass these exams to get into the second year theyre very important i should have started studying a month ago i dont know whats gotten into meunfortunately the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as hermione they piled so much homework on them that the easter holidays werent nearly as much fun as the christmas ones it was hard to relax with hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragons blood or practicing wand movements moaning and yawning harry and ron spent most of their free time in the library with her trying to get through all their extra workill never remember this ron burst out one afternoon throwing down his quill and looking longingly out of the library window it was the first really fine day theyd had in months the sky was a clear forgetmenot blue and there was a feeling in the air of summer comingharry who was looking up dittany in one thousand magical herbs and fungi didnt look up until he heard ron say hagrid what are you doing in the libraryhagrid shuffled into view hiding something behind his back he looked very out of place in his moleskin overcoatjus lookin he said in a shifty voice that got their interest at once an whatre you lot up ter he looked suddenly suspicious yer not still lookin fer nicolas flamel are yeh oh we found out who he is ages ago said ron impressively and we know what that dogs guarding its a sorcerers st

what section he was in said ron whod had enough of working he came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms and slammed them down on the tabledragons he whispered hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons look at these dragon species of great britain and ireland from egg to inferno a dragon keepers guidehagrids always wanted a dragon he told me so the first time i ever met him said harrybut its against our laws said ron dragon breeding was outlawed by the warlocks convention of everyone knows that its hard to stop muggles from noticing us if were keeping dragons in the back garden anyway you cant tame dragons its dangerous you should see the burns charlies got off wild ones in romaniabut there arent wild dragons in britain said harryof course there are said ron common welsh green and hebridean blacks the ministry of magic has a job hushing them up i can tell youour kind have to keep putting spells on muggles whove spotted them to make them forgetso what on earths hagrid up to said hermionewhen they knocked on the door of the gamekeepers hut an hour later they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed hagrid called who is it before he let them in and then shut the door quickly behind themit was stifling hot inside even though it was such a warm day there was a blazing fire in the grate hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiches which they refusedso yeh wanted to ask me somethinyes said harry there was no point beating around the bush we were wondering if you could tell us whats guarding the sorcerers stone apart from fluffyhagrid frowned at himcourse i cant he said number one i don know meself number two yeh know too much already so i wouldn tell yeh if i could that stones here fer a good reason it was almost stolen outta gringotts i sppose yehve worked that out an all beats me how yeh even know abou fluffyoh come on hagrid you might not want to tell us but you do know you know everything that goes on round here said hermione in a warm flattering voice hagrids beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling we only wondered who had done the guarding really hermione went on we wondered who dumbledore had trusted enough to help him apart from youhagrids chest swelled at these last words harry and ron beamed at hermionewell i don spose it could hurt ter tell yeh that lets see he borrowed fluffy from me then some o the teachers did enchantmentsprofessor sprout professor flitwick professor mcgonagall he ticked them off on his fingers professor quirrell an dumbledore himself did somethin o course hang on ive forgotten someone oh yeah professor snapesnapeyeah yer not still on abou that are yeh look snape helped protect the stone hes not about ter steal itharry knew ron and hermione were thinking the same as he was if snape had been in on protecting the stone it must have been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded it he probably knew everything except it seemed quirrells spell and how to get past fluffyyoure the only one who knows how to get past fluffy arent you hagrid said harry anxiously and you wouldnt tell anyone would you not even one of the teachersnot a soul knows except me an dumbledore said hagrid proudlywell thats something harry muttered to the others hagrid can we have a window open im boilingcant harry sorry said hagrid harry noticed him glance at the fire harry looked at it toohagrid whats thatbut he already knew what it was in the very heart of the fire underneath the kettle was a huge black eggah said hagrid fiddling nervously with his beard thats erwhere did you get it hagrid said ron crouching over the fire to get a closer look at the egg it mustve cost you a fortunewon it said hagrid las night i was down in the village havin a few drinks an got into a game o cards with a stranger think he was quite glad ter get rid of it ter be honestbut what are you going to do with it when its hatched said hermionewell ive bin doin some readin said hagrid pulling a large book from under his pillow got this outta the library dragon breeding for pleasure and profit its a bit outta date o course but its all in here keep the egg in the fire cause their mothers breathe on i em see an when it hatches feed it on a bucket o brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour an see here how ter recognize diffrent eggs what i got theres a norwegian ridgeback theyre rare themhe looked very pleased with himself but hermione didnthagrid you live in a wooden house she saidbut hagrid wasnt listening he was humming merrily as he stoked the fireso now they had something else to worry about what might happen to hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hutwonder what its like to have a peaceful life ron sighed as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting hermione had now started making study schedules for harry and ron too it was driving them nutsthen one breakfast time hedwig brought harry another note from hagridhe had written only two words its hatchingron wanted to skip herbology and go straight down to the hut hermione wouldnt hear of ithermione how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatchingweve got lessons well get into trouble and thats nothing to what hagrids going to be in when someone finds out what hes doing shut up harry whisperedmalfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen how much had he heard harry didnt like the look on malfoys face at allron and hermione argued all the way to herbology and in the end hermione agreed to run down to hagrids with the other two during morning break when the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest hagrid greeted them looking flushed and excitedits nearly out he ushered them insidethe egg was lying on the table there were deep cracks in it something was moving inside a funny clicking noise was coming from itthey all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated breathall at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open the baby dragon flopped onto the table it wasnt exactly pretty harry thought it looked like a crumpled black umbrella its spiny wings were huge compared to its skinny jet body it had a long snout with wide nostrils the stubs of horns and bulging orange eyesit sneezed a couple of sparks flew out of its snoutisnt he beautiful hagrid murmured he reached out a hand to stroke the dragons head it snapped at his fingers showing pointed fangsbless him look he knows his mommy said hagridhagrid said hermione how fast do norwegian ridgebacks grow exactlyhagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his face he leapt to his feet and ran to the windowwhats the mattersomeone was lookin through the gap in the curtains its a kid hes runnin back up ter the schoolharry bolted to the door and looked out even at a distance there was no mistaking himmalfoy had seen the dragonsomething about the smile lurking on malfoys face during the next week made harry ron and hermione very nervous they spent most of their free time in hagrids darkened hut trying to reason with himjust let him go harry urged set him freei cant said hagrid hes too little hed diethey looked at the dragon it had grown three times in length in just a week smoke kept furling out of its nostrils hagrid hadnt been doing his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy there were empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floorive decided to call him norbert said hagrid looking at the dragon with misty eyes he really knows me now watch norbert norbert wheres mommyhes lost his marbles ron muttered in harrys earhagrid said harry loudly give it two weeks and norberts going to be as long as your house malfoy could go to dumbledore at any momenthagrid bit his lipi i know i cant keep him forever but i cant jus dump him i cantharry suddenly turned to ron charlie he saidyoure losing it too said ron im ron rememberno charlie your brother charlie in romania studying dragonswe could send norbert to him charlie can take care of him and then put him back in the wildbrilliant said ron how about it hagridand in the end hagrid agreed that they could send an owl to charlie to ask himthe following week dragged by wednesday night found hermione and harry sitting alone in the common room long after everyone else had gone to bed the clock on the wall had just chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off harrys invisibility cloak he had been down at hagrids hut helping him feed norbert who was now eating dead rats by the crateit bit me he said showing them his hand which was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief im not going to be able to hold a quill for a week i tell you that dragons the most horrible animal ive ever met but the way hagrid goes on about it youd think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit when it bit me he told me off for frightening it and when i left he was singing it a lullabythere was a tap on the dark windowits hedwig said harry hurrying to let her in shell have charlies answerthe three of them put their heads together to read the notedear ronhow are you thanks for the letter id be glad to take the norwegian ridgeback but it wont be easy getting him here i think the best thing will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week trouble is they mustnt be seen carrying an illegal dragoncould you get the ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on saturday they can meet you there and take him away while its still darksend me an answer as soon as possiblelovecharliethey looked at one anotherweve got the invisibility cloak said harry it shouldnt be too difficult i think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and norbertit was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him anything to get rid of norbert and malfoythere was a hitch by the next morning rons bitten hand had swollen to twice its usual size he didnt know whether it was safe to go to madam pomfrey would she recognize a dragon bite by the afternoon though he had no choice the cut had turned a nasty shade of green it looked as if norberts fangs were poisonousharry and hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find ron in a terrible state in bedits not just my hand he whispered although that feels like its about to fall off malfoy told madam pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me he kept threatening to tell her what really bit me ive told her it was a dog but i dont think she believes me i shouldnt have hit him at the quidditch match thats why hes doing thisharry and hermione tried to calm ron downitll all be over at midnight on saturday said hermione but this didnt soothe ron at all on the contrary he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweatmidnight on saturday he said in a hoarse voice oh no oh no ive just remembered charlies letter was in that book malfoy took hes going to know were getting rid of norbertharry and hermione didnt get a chance to answer madam pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave saying ron needed sleepits too late to change the plan now harry told hermione we havent got time to send charlie another owl and this could be our only chance to get rid of norbert well have to risk it and we have got the invisibility cloak malfoy doesnt know about thatthey found fang the boarhound sitting outside with a bandaged tail when they went to tell hagrid who opened a window to talk to themi wont let you in he puffed norberts at a tricky stage nothin i cant handlewhen they told him about charlies letter his eyes filled with tears although that might have been because norbert had just bitten him on the legaargh its all right he only got my boot jus playin hes only a baby after allthe baby banged its tail on the wall making the windows rattle harry and hermione walked back to the castle feeling saturday couldnt come quickly enoughthey would have felt sorry for hagrid when the time came for him to say goodbye to norbert if they hadnt been so worried about what they had to do it was a very dark cloudy night and they were a bit late arriving at hagrids hut because theyd had to wait for peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall where hed been playing tennis against the wall hagrid had norbert packed and ready in a large cratehes got lots o rats an some brandy fer the journey said hagrid in a muffled voice an ive packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonelyfrom inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to harry as though the teddy was having his head torn offbyebye norbert hagrid sobbed as harry and hermione covered the crate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it themselvesmommy will never forget youhow they managed to get the crate back up to the castle they never knew midnight ticked nearer as they heaved norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors up another staircase then another even one of harrys shortcuts didnt make the work much easiernearly there harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the tallest towerthen a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crateforgetting that they were already invisible they shrank into the shadows staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away a lamp flaredprofessor mcgonagall in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net had malfoy by the eardetention she shouted and twenty points from slytherin wandering around in the middle of the night how dare you you dont understand professor harry potters coming hes got a dragonwhat utter rubbish how dare you tell such lies come on i shall see professor snape about you malfoythe steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that not until theyd stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak glad to be able to breathe properly again hermione did a sort of jigmalfoys got detention i could singdont harry advised herchuckling about malfoy they waited norbert thrashing about in his crate about ten minutes later four broomsticks came swooping down out of the darknesscharlies friends were a cheery lot they showed harry and hermione the harness theyd rigged up so they could suspend norbert between themthey all helped buckle norbert safely into it and then harry and hermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very muchat last norbert was going going gonethey slipped back down the spiral staircase their hearts as light as their hands now that norbert was off them no more dragon malfoy in detention what could spoil their happiness the answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs as they stepped into the corridor filchs face loomed suddenly out of the darknesswell well well he whispered we are in troubletheyd left the invisibility cloak on top of the towerchapter fifteenthe foribidden forestthings couldnt have been worsefilch took them down to professor mcgonagalls study on the first floor where they sat and waited without saying a word to each other hermione was trembling excuses alibis and wild cover up stories chased each other around harrys brain each more feeble than the last he couldnt see how they were going to get out of trouble this time they were cornered how could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak there was no reason on earth that professor mcgonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of night let alone being up the tallest astronomy tower which was outofbounds except for classes add norbert and the invisibility cloak and they might as well be packing their bags alreadyhad harry thought that things couldnt have been worse he was wrongwhen professor mcgonagall appeared she was leading nevilleharry neville burst out the moment he saw the other two i was trying to find you to warn you i heard malfoy saying he was going to catch you he said you had a drag harry shook his head violently to shut neville up but professor mcgonagall had seen she looked more likely to breathe fire than norbert as she towered over the three of themi would never have believed it of any of you mr filch says you were up in the astronomy tower its one oclock in the morning explain yourselvesit was the first time hermione had ever failed to answer a teachers question she was staring at her slippers as still as a statuei think ive got a good idea of whats been going on said professor mcgonagall it doesnt take a genius to work it out you fed draco malfoy some cockandbull story about a dragon trying to get him out of bed and into trouble ive already caught him i suppose you think its funny that longbottom here heard the story and believed it tooharry caught nevilles eye and tried to tell him without words that this wasnt true because neville was looking stunned and hurt poor blundering neville harry knew what it must have cost him to try and find them in the dark to warn themim disgusted said professor mcgonagall four students out of bed in one night ive never heard of such a thing before you miss granger i thought you had more sense as for you mr potter i thought gryffindor meant more to you than this all three of you will receive detentions yes you too mr longbottom nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night especially these days its very dangerous and fifty points will be taken from gryffindorfifty harry gasped they would lose the lead the lead hed won in the last quidditch matchfifty points each said professor mcgonagall breathing heavily through her long pointed noseprofessor please you cant dont tell me what i can and cant do potter now get back to bed all of you ive never been more ashamed of gryffindor studentsa hundred and fifty points lost that put gryffindor in last place in one night theyd ruined any chance gryffindor had had for the house cup harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach how could they ever make up for this harry didnt sleep all night he could hear neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours harry couldnt think of anything to say to comfort him he knew neville like himself was dreading the dawn what would happen when the rest of gryffindor found out what theyd done at first gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the house points the next day thought thered been a mistake how could they suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday and then the story started to spread harry potter the famous harry potter their hero of two quidditch matches had lo st them all those points him and a couple of other stupid first yearsfrom being one of the most popular and admired people at the school harry was suddenly the most hated even ravenclaws and hufflepuffs turned on him because everyone had been longing to see slytherin lose the house cup everywhere harry went people pointed and didnt trouble to lower their voices as they insulted him slytherins on the other hand clapped as he walked past them whistling and cheering thanks potter we owe you oneonly ron stood by himtheyll all forget this in a few weeks fred and george have lost loads of points in all the time theyve been here and people still like themtheyve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go though have they said harry miserablywell no ron admittedit was a bit late to repair the damage but harry swore to himself not to meddle in things that werent his business from now on hed had it with sneaking around and spying he felt so ashamed of himself that he went to wood and offered to resign from the quidditch teamresign wood thundered what goodll that do how are we going to get any points back if we cant win at quidditchbut even quidditch had lost its fun the rest of the team wouldnt speak to harry during practice and if they had to speak about him they called him the seekerhermione and neville were suffering too they didnt have as bad a time as harry because they werent as wellknown but nobody would speak to them either hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class keeping her head down and working in silenceharry was almost glad that the exams werent far away all the studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery he ron and hermione kept to themselves working late into the night trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions learn charms and spells by heart memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellionsthen about a week before the exams were due to start harrys new resolution not to interfere in anything that didnt concern him was put to an unexpected test walking back from the library on his own one afternoon he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead as he drew closer he heard quirrells voiceno no not again please it sounded as though someone was threatening him harry moved closerall right all right he heard quirrell sobnext second quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening his turban he was pale and looked as though he was about to cry he strode out of sight harry didnt think quirrell had even noticed himhe waited until quirrells footsteps had disappeared then peered into the classroom it was empty but a door stood ajar at the other endharry was halfway toward it before he remembered what hed promised himself about not meddlingall the same hed have gambled twelve sorcerers stones that snape had just left the room and from what harry had just heard snape would be walking with a new spring in his step quirrell seemed to have given in at lastharry went back to the library where hermione was testing ron on astronomy harry told them what hed heardsnapes done it then said ron if quirrells told him how to break his antidark force spell theres still fluffy though said hermionemaybe snapes found out how to get past him without asking hagridsaid ron looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them i bet theres a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant threeheaded dog so what do we do harrythe light of adventure was kindling again in rons eyes but hermione answered before harry couldgo to dumbledore thats what we should have done ages ago if we try anything ourselves well be thrown out for surebut weve got no proof said harry quirrells too scared to back us up snapes only got to say he doesnt know how the troll got in at halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor who do you think theyll believe him or us its not exactly a secret we hate him dumbledorell think we made it up to get him sacked filch wouldnt help us if his life depended on it hes too friendly with snape and the more students get thrown out the better hell think and dont forget were not supposed to know about the stone or fluffy thatll take a lot of explaininghermione looked convinced but ron didntif we just do a bit of poking around no said harry flatly weve done enough poking aroundhe pulled a map of jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of its moonsthe following morning notes were delivered to harry hermione and neville at the breakfast table they were all the same your detention will take place at eleven oclock tonight meet mr filch in the entrance hallprofessor mcgonagall harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points theyd lost he half expected hermione to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost but she didnt say a word like harry she felt they deserved what theyd gotat eleven oclock that night they said goodbye to ron in the common room and went down to the entrance hall with neville filch was already there and so was malfoy harry had also forgotten that malfoy had gotten a detention toofollow me said filch lighting a lamp and leading them outsidei bet youll think twice about breaking a school rule again wont you eh he said leering at them oh yes hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask me its just a pity they let the old punishments die out hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days ive got the chains still in my office keep em well oiled in case theyre ever needed right off we go and dont think of running off now itll be worse for you if you dothey marched off across the dark grounds neville kept sniffing harry wondered what their punishment was going to be it must be something really horrible or filch wouldnt be sounding so delightedthe moon was bright but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them into darkness ahead harry could see the lighted windows of hagrids hut then they heard a distant shoutis that you filch hurry up i want ter get startedharrys heart rose if they were going to be working with hagrid it wouldnt be so bad his relief must have showed in his face because filch said i suppose you think youll be enjoying yourself with that oaf well think again boy its into the forest youre going and im much mistaken if youll all come out in one pieceat this neville let out a little moan and malfoy stopped dead in his tracksthe forest he repeated and he didnt sound quite as cool as usualwe cant go in there at night theres all sorts of things in there werewolves i heardneville clutched the sleeve of harrys robe and made a choking noisethats your problem isnt it said filch his voice cracking with glee shouldve thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble shouldnt youhagrid came striding toward them out of the dark fang at his heel he was carrying his large crossbow and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulderabou time he said i bin waitin fer half an hour already all right

fiercelyyehve done wrong an now yehve got ter pay fer itbut this is servant stuff its not for students to do i thought wed be copying lines or something if my father knew i was doing this hed tell yer

no one takin risks follow me over here a momenthe led them to the very edge of the forest holding his lamp up high he pointed down a narrow winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees a light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the forestlook there said hagrid see that stuff shinin on the ground silvery stuff thats unicorn blood theres a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat this is the second time in a week i found one dead last wednesday were gonna try an find the poor thing we might have ter put it out of its miseryand what if whatever hurt the unicorn

sparks right get yer wands out an practice now thats it an if anyone gets in trouble send up red sparks an well all come an find yeh so be careful lets gothe forest was black and silent a little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path and harry hermione and hagrid took the left path while malfoy neville and fang took the rightthey walked in silence their eyes on the ground every now and then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silverblue blood on the fallen leavesharry saw that hagrid looked very worriedcould a werewolf be killing the unicorns harry askednot fast enough said hagrid its not easy ter catch a unicorn theyre powerful magic creatures i never knew one ter be hurt beforethey walked past a mossy tree stump harry could hear running water there must be a stream somewhere close by there were still spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding pathyou all right hermione hagrid whispered don worry it cantve gone far if its this badly hurt an then well be able ter get behind that treehagrid seized harry and hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a towering oak he pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow raising it ready to fire the three of them listened something was slithering over dead leaves nearby it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground hagrid was squinting up the dark path but after a few seconds the sound faded awayi knew it he murmured theres summat in here that shouldn bea werewolf harry suggestedthat wasn no werewolf an it wasn no unicorn neither said hagrid grimly right follow me but careful nowthey walked more slowly ears straining for the faintest soundsuddenly in a clearing ahead something definitely movedwhos there hagrid called show yerself im armedand into the clearing came was it a man or a horse to the waist a man with red hair and beard but below that was a horses gleaming chestnut body with a long reddish tail harry and hermiones jaws droppedoh its you ronan

looking nervously over his shoulder he had the nasty feeling they were being watched he was very glad they had hagrid and his crossbow with themthey had just passed a bend in the path when hermione grabbed hagrids armhagrid look red sparks the others are in troubleyou two wait here hagrid shouted stay on the path ill come back for yehthey heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking at each other very scared until they couldnt hear anything but the rustling of leaves around themyou dont think theyve been hurt do you whispered hermionei dont care if malfoy has but if somethings got neville its our fault hes here in the first placethe minutes dragged by their ears seemed sharper than usual harrys seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind every cracking twigwhat was going on where were the others at last a great crunching noise announced hagrids return malfoy neville and fang were with him hagrid was fuming malfoy it seemed had sneaked up behind neville and grabbed him as a joke neville had panicked and sent up the sparkswell be lucky ter catch anythin now with the racket you two were makin right were changin groups neville you stay with me an hermione harry you go with fang an this idiot im sorry hagrid added in a whisper to harry but hell have a harder time frightenin you an weve gotta get this doneso harry set off into the heart of the forest with malfoy and fang they walked for nearly half an hour deeper and deeper into the forest until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker there were splashes on the roots of a tree as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by harry could see a clearing ahead through the tangled branches of an ancient oaklook he murmured holding out his arm to stop malfoysomething bright white was gleaming on the ground they inched closerit was the unicorn all right and it was dead harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad its long slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearlywhite on the dark leavesharry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood a bush on the edge of the clearing quiveredthen out of the shadows a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast harry malfoy and fang stood transfixed the cloaked figure reached the unicorn lowered its head over the wound in the animals side and began to drink its bloodaaaaaaaaaarghmalfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted so did fang the hooded figure raised its head and looked right at harry unicorn blood was dribbling down its front it got to its feet and came swiftly toward harry he couldnt move for fearthen a pain like hed never felt before pierced his head it was as though his scar were on fire half blinded he staggered backward he heard hooves behind him galloping and something jumped clean over harry charging at the figurethe pain in harrys head was so bad he fell to his knees it took a minute or two to pass when he looked up the figure had gone a centaur was standing over him not ronan or bane this one looked younger he had whiteblond hair and a palomino bodyare you all right said the centaur pulling harry to his feetyes thank you what was thatthe centaur didnt answer he had astonishingly blue eyes like pale sapphires he looked carefully at harry his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out livid on harrys foreheadyou are the potter boy he said you had better get back to hagridthe forest is not safe at this time especially for you can you ride it will be quicker this waymy name is firenze he added as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that harry could clamber onto his backthere was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing ronan and bane came bursting through the trees their flanks heaving and sweatyfirenze bane thundered what are you doing you have a human on your back have you no shame are you a common muledo you realize who this is said firenze this is the potter boy the quicker he leaves this forest the betterwhat have you been telling him growled bane remember firenze we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planetsronan pawed the ground nervously im sure firenze thought he was acting for the best he said in his gloomy voicebane kicked his back legs in angerfor the best what is that to do with us centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold it is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forestfirenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger so that harry had to grab his shoulders to stay ondo you not see that unicorn firenze bellowed at bane do you not understand why it was killed or have the planets not let you in on that secret i set myself against what is lurking in this forest bane yes with humans alongside me if i mustand firenze whisked around with harry clutching on as best he could they plunged off into the trees leaving ronan and bane behind themharry didnt have a clue what was going onwhys bane so angry he asked what was that thing you saved me from anywayfirenze slowed to a walk warned harry to keep his head bowed in case of lowhanging branches but did not answer harrys question they made their way through the trees in silence for so long that harry thought firenze didnt want to talk to him anymore they were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees however when firenze suddenly stoppedharry potter do you know what unicorn blood is used forno said harry startled by the odd question weve only used the horn and tail hair in potionsthat is because it is a monstrous thing to slay a unicorn said firenze only one who has nothing to lose and everything to gain would commit such a crime the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death but at a terrible price you have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself and you will have but a halflife a cursed life from the moment the blood touches your lipsharry stared at the back of firenzes head which was dappled silver in the moonlightbut whod be that desperate he wondered aloud if youre going to be cursed forever deaths better isnt itit is firenze agreed unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else something that will bring you back to full strength and power something that will mean you can never diemr potter do you know what is hidden in the school at this very momentthe sorcerers stone of course the elixir of life but i dont understand who can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power who has clung to life awaiting their chanceit was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around harrys heart over the rustling of the trees he seemed to hear once more what hagrid had told him on the night they had met some say he diedcodswallop in my opinion dunno if he had enough human left in him to diedo you mean harry croaked that was volharry harry are you all righthermione was running toward them down the path hagrid puffing along behind herim fine said harry hardly knowing what he was saying the unicorns dead hagrid its in that clearing back therethis is where i leave you firenze murmured as hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn you are safe nowharry slid off his backgood luck harry potter said firenze the planets have been read wrongly before now even by centaurs i hope this is one of those timeshe turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest leaving harry shivering behind himron had fallen asleep in the dark common room waiting for them to return he shouted something about quidditch fouls when harry roughly shook him awake in a matter of seconds though he was wideeyed as harry began to tell him and hermione what had happened in the forestharry couldnt sit down he paced up and down in front of the fire he was still shakingsnape wants the stone for voldemort and voldemorts waiting in the forest and all this time we thought snape just wanted to get rich
