a game of thrones book one of a song of ice and fire by george r r martin prologue we should start back gared urged as the woods began to grow dark around them the wildlings are dead do the dead frighten you ser waymar royce asked with just the hint of a smile gared did not rise to the bait he was an old man past fifty and he had seen the lordlings come and go dead is dead he said we have no business with the dead are they dead royce asked softly what proof have we will saw them gared said if he says they are dead thats proof enough for me will had known they would drag him into the quarrel sooner or later he wished it had been later rather than sooner my mother told me that dead men sing no songs he put in my wet nurse said the same thing will royce replied never believe anything you hear at a womans tit there are things to be learned even from the dead his voice echoed too loud in the twilit forest page we have a long ride before us gared pointed out eight days maybe nine and night is falling ser waymar royce glanced at the sky with disinterest it does that every day about this time are you unmanned by the dark gared will could see the tightness around gareds mouth the barely sup pressed anger in his eyes under the thick black hood of his cloak gared had spent forty years in the nights watch man and boy and he was not accustomed to being made light of yet it was more than that under the wounded pride will could sense something else in the older man you could taste it a nervous tension that came perilous close to fear will shared his unease he had been four years on the wall the first time he had been sent beyond all the old stories had come rushing back and his bowels had turned to water he had laughed about it afterward he was a veteran of a hundred rangings by now and the endless dark wilderness that the southron called the haunted forest had no more terrors for him until tonight something was different tonight there was an edge to this darkness that made his hackles rise nine days they had been riding north and northwest and then north again farther and farther from the wall hard on the track of a band of wildling raiders each day had been worse than the day that had come before it today was the worst of all a cold wind was blowing out of the north and it made the trees rustle like living things all day will had felt as though something were watching him something cold and implacable that loved him not gared had felt it too will wanted nothing so much as to ride hellbent for the safety of the wall but that was not a feeling to share with your commander especially not a commander like this one ser waymar royce was the youngest son of an ancient house with too many heirs he was a handsome youth of eighteen greyeyed and graceful and slender as a knife mounted on his huge black destrier the knight towered above will and gared on their smaller garrons he wore black leather boots black woolen pants black moleskin gloves and a fine supple coat of gleaming black ringmail over layers of black wool and boiled leather ser waymar had been a sworn brother of the nights watch for less than half a year but no one could say he had not prepared for his vocation at least insofar as his wardrobe was concerned his cloak was his crowning glory sable thick and black and soft as sin bet he killed them all himself he did gared told the barracks over wine twisted their little heads off our mighty warrior they had all shared the laugh it is hard to take orders from a man you laughed at in your cups will reflected as he sat shivering atop his garron gared must have felt the same mormont said as we should track them and we did gared said theyre dead they shant trouble us no more theres hard riding before us i dont like this weather if it snows we could be a fortnight getting back and snows the best we can hope for ever seen an ice storm my lord the lordling seemed not to hear him he studied the deepening twilight in that halfbored halfdistracted page way he had will had ridden with the knight long enough to understand that it was best not to interrupt him when he looked like that tell me again what you saw will all the details leave nothing out will had been a hunter before he joined the nights watch well a poacher in truth mallister freeriders had caught him redhanded in the mallisters own woods skinning one of the mallisters own bucks and it had been a choice of putting on the black or losing a hand no one could move through the woods as silent as will and it had not taken the black brothers long to discover his talent the camp is two miles farther on over that ridge hard beside a stream will said i got close as i dared theres eight of them men and women both no children i could see they put up a leanto against the rock the snows pretty well covered it now but i could still make it out no fire burning but the firepit was still plain as day no one moving i watched a long time no living man ever lay so still did you see any blood well no will admitted did you see any weapons some swords a few bows one man had an axe heavylooking doublebladed a cruel piece of iron it was on the ground beside him right by his hand did you make note of the position of the bodies will shrugged a couple are sitting up against the rock most of them on the ground fallen like or sleeping royce suggested fallen will insisted theres one woman up an ironwood halfhid in the branches a fareyes he smiled thinly i took care she never saw me when i got closer i saw that she wasnt moving neither despite himself he shivered you have a chill royce asked some will muttered the wind mlord the young knight turned back to his grizzled manatarms frostfallen leaves whispered past them and royces destrier moved restlessly what do you think might have killed these men gared ser waymar asked casually he adjusted the drape of his long sable cloak it was the cold gared said with iron certainty i saw men freeze last winter and the one before when i was half a boy everyone talks about snows forty foot deep and how the ice wind comes howling out of the north but the real enemy is the cold it steals up on you quieter than will and at first you shiver and your teeth chatter and you stamp your feet and dream of mulled wine and nice hot fires it burns it does nothing burns like the cold but only for a while then it gets inside you and starts to fill you up and after a while you dont have the strength to fight it its easier just to sit down or go to sleep they say you dont feel any pain toward the end first you go weak and drowsy and everything starts to fade and then its like sinking into a sea of warm milk peaceful like such eloquence gared ser waymar observed i never suspected you had it in you page ive had the cold in me too lordling gared pulled back his hood giving ser waymar a good long look at the stumps where his ears had been two ears three toes and the little finger off my left hand i got off light we found my brother frozen at his watch with a smile on his face ser waymar shrugged you ought dress more warmly gared gared glared at the lordling the scars around his ear holes flushed red with anger where maester aemon had cut the ears away well see how warm you can dress when the winter comes he pulled up his hood and hunched over his garron silent and sullen if gared said it was the cold will began have you drawn any watches this past week will yes mlord there never was a week when he did not draw a dozen bloody watches what was the man driving at and how did you find the wall weeping will said frowning he saw it clear enough now that the lordling had pointed it out they couldnt have froze not if the wall was weeping it wasnt cold enough royce nodded bright lad weve had a few light frosts this past week and a quick flurry of snow now and then but surely no cold fierce enough to kill eight grown men men clad in fur and leather let me remind you with shelter near at hand and the means of making fire the knights smile was cocksure will lead us there i would see these dead men for myself and then there was nothing to be done for it the order had been given and honor bound them to obey will went in front his shaggy little garron picking the way carefully through the undergrowth a light snow had fallen the night before and there were stones and roots and hidden sinks lying just under its crust waiting for the careless and the unwary ser waymar royce came next his great black destrier snorting impatiently the warhorse was the wrong mount for ranging but try and tell that to the lordling gared brought up the rear the old manatarms muttered to himself as he rode twilight deepened the cloudless sky turned a deep purple the color of an old bruise then faded to black the stars began to come out a halfmoon rose will was grateful for the light we can make a better pace than this surely royce said when the moon was full risen not with this horse will said fear had made him insolent perhaps my lord would care to take the lead ser waymar royce did not deign to reply somewhere off in the wood a wolf howled will pulled his garron over beneath an ancient gnarled ironwood and dismounted page why are you stopping ser waymar asked best go the rest of the way on foot mlord its just over that ridge royce paused a moment staring off into the distance his face reflective a cold wind whispered through the trees his great sable cloak stirred behind like something halfalive theres something wrong here gared muttered the young knight gave him a disdainful smile is there cant you feel it gared asked listen to the darkness will could feel it four years in the nights watch and he had never been so afraid what was it wind trees rustling a wolf which sound is it that unmans you so gared when gared did not answer royce slid gracefully from his saddle he tied the destrier securely to a lowhanging limb well away from the other horses and drew his longsword from its sheath jewels glittered in its hilt and the moonlight ran down the shining steel it was a splendid weapon castleforged and newmade from the look of it will doubted it had ever been swung in anger the trees press close here will warned that sword will tangle you up mord better a knife if i need instruction i will ask for it the young lord said gared stay here guard the horses gared dismounted we need a fire ill see to it how big a fool are you old man if there are enemies in this wood a fire is the last thing we want theres some enemies a fire will keep away gared said bears and direwolves and and other things ser waymars mouth became a hard line no fire gareds hood shadowed his face but will could see the hard glitter in his eyes as he stared at the knight for a moment he was afraid the older man would go for his sword it was a short ugly thing its grip discolored by sweat its edge nicked from hard use but will would not have given an iron bob for the lordlings life if gared pulled it from its scabbard finally gared looked down no fire he muttered low under his breath royce took it for acquiescence and turned away lead on he said to will will threaded their way through a thicket then started up the slope to the low ridge where he had found his vantage point under a sentinel tree under the thin crust of snow the ground was damp and muddy slick footing with rocks and hidden roots to trip you up will made no sound as he climbed behind him he heard the soft metallic slither of the lordlings ringmail the rustle of leaves and muttered curses as reaching branches grabbed at his longsword and tugged on his splendid sable cloak the great sentinel was right there at the top of the ridge where will had known it would be its lowest branches a bare foot off the ground will slid in underneath flat on his belly in the snow and the mud and page looked down on the empty clearing below his heart stopped in his chest for a moment he dared not breathe moonlight shone down on the clearing the ashes of the firepit the snowcovered leanto the great rock the little halffrozen stream everything was just as it had been a few hours ago they were gone all the bodies were gone gods he heard behind him a sword slashed at a branch as ser waymar royce gained the ridge he stood there beside the sentinel longsword in hand his cloak billowing behind him as the wind came up outlined nobly against the stars for all to see get down will whispered urgently somethings wrong royce did not move he looked down at the empty clearing and laughed your dead men seem to have moved camp will wills voice abandoned him he groped for words that did not come it was not possible his eyes swept back and forth over the abandoned campsite stopped on the axe a huge doublebladed battleaxe still lying where he had seen it last untouched a valuable weapon on your feet will ser waymar commanded theres no one here i wont have you hiding under a bush reluctantly will obeyed ser waymar looked him over with open disapproval i am not going back to castle black a failure on my first ranging we will find these men he glanced around up the tree be quick about it look for a fire will turned away wordless there was no use to argue the wind was moving it cut right through him he went to the tree a vaulting greygreen sentinel and began to climb soon his hands were sticky with sap and he was lost among the needles fear filled his gut like a meal he could not digest he whispered a prayer to the nameless gods of the wood and slipped his dirk free of its sheath he put it between his teeth to keep both hands free for climbing the taste of cold iron in his mouth gave him comfort down below the lordling called out suddenly who goes there will heard uncertainty in the challenge he stopped climbing he listened he watched the woods gave answer the rustle of leaves the icy rush of the stream a distant hoot of a snow owl the others made no sound will saw movement from the corner of his eye pale shapes gliding through the wood he turned his head glimpsed a white shadow in the darkness then it was gone branches stirred gently in the wind scratching at one another with wooden fingers will opened his mouth to call down a warning and the words seemed to freeze in his throat perhaps he was wrong perhaps it had only been a bird a reflection on the snow some trick of the moonlight what had he seen after all will where are you ser waymar called up can you see anything he was turning in a slow circle suddenly wary his sword in hand he must have felt them as will felt them there was nothing to see page answer me why is it so cold it was cold shivering will clung more tightly to his perch his face pressed hard against the trunk of the sentinel he could feel the sweet sticky sap on his cheek a shadow emerged from the dark of the wood it stood in front of royce tall it was and gaunt and hard as old bones with flesh pale as milk its armor seemed to change color as it moved here it was white as newfallen snow there black as shadow everywhere dappled with the deep greygreen of the trees the patterns ran like moonlight on water with every step it took will heard the breath go out of ser waymar royce in a long hiss come no farther the lordling warned his voice cracked like a boys he threw the long sable cloak back over his shoulders to free his arms for battle and took his sword in both hands the wind had stopped it was very cold the other slid forward on silent feet in its hand was a longsword like none that will had ever seen no human metal had gone into the forging of that blade it was alive with moonlight translucent a shard of crystal so thin that it seemed almost to vanish when seen edgeon there was a faint blue shimmer to the thing a ghostlight that played around its edges and somehow will knew it was sharper than any razor ser waymar met him bravely dance with me then he lifted his sword high over his head defiant his hands trembled from the weight of it or perhaps from the cold yet in that moment will thought he was a boy no longer but a man of the nights watch the other halted will saw its eyes blue deeper and bluer than any human eyes a blue that burned like ice they fixed on the longsword trembling on high watched the moonlight running cold along the metal for a heartbeat he dared to hope they emerged silently from the shadows twins to the first three of them four five ser waymar may have felt the cold that came with them but he never saw them never heard them will had to call out it was his duty and his death if he did he shivered and hugged the tree and kept the silence the pale sword came shivering through the air ser waymar met it with steel when the blades met there was no ring of metal on metal only a high thin sound at the edge of hearing like an animal screaming in pain royce checked a second blow and a third then fell back a step another flurry of blows and he fell back again behind him to right to left all around him the watchers stood patient faceless silent the shifting patterns of their delicate armor making them all but invisible in the wood yet they made no move to interfere again and again the swords met until will wanted to cover his ears against the strange anguished keening of their clash ser waymar was panting from the effort now his breath steaming in the moonlight his blade was white with frost the others danced with pale blue light then royces parry came a beat too late the pale sword bit through the ringmail beneath his arm the young lord cried out in pain blood welled between the rings it steamed in the cold and the droplets seemed red as fire where they touched the snow ser page waymars fingers brushed his side his moleskin glove came away soaked with red the other said something in a language that will did not know his voice was like the cracking of ice on a winter lake and the words were mocking ser waymar royce found his fury for robert he shouted and he came up snarling lifting the frostcovered longsword with both hands and swinging it around in a flat sidearm slash with all his weight behind it the others parry was almost lazy when the blades touched the steel shattered a scream echoed through the forest night and the longsword shivered into a hundred brittle pieces the shards scattering like a rain of needles royce went to his knees shrieking and covered his eyes blood welled between his fingers the watchers moved forward together as if some signal had been given swords rose and fell all in a deathly silence it was cold butchery the pale blades sliced through ringmail as if it were silk will closed his eyes far beneath him he heard their voices and laughter sharp as icicles when he found the courage to look again a long time had passed and the ridge below was empty he stayed in the tree scarce daring to breathe while the moon crept slowly across the black sky finally his muscles cramping and his fingers numb with cold he climbed down royces body lay facedown in the snow one arm outflung the thick sable cloak had been slashed in a dozen places lying dead like that you saw how young he was a boy he found what was left of the sword a few feet away the end splintered and twisted like a tree struck by lightning will knelt looked around warily and snatched it up the broken sword would be his proof gared would know what to make of it and if not him then surely that old bear mormont or maester aemon would gared still be waiting with the horses he had to hurry will rose ser waymar royce stood over him his fine clothes were a tatter his face a ruin a shard from his sword transfixed the blind white pupil of his left eye the right eye was open the pupil burned blue it saw the broken sword fell from nerveless fingers will closed his eyes to pray long elegant hands brushed his cheek then tightened around his throat they were gloved in the finest moleskin and sticky with blood yet the touch was icy cold bran the morning had dawned clear and cold with a crispness that hinted at the end of summer they set forth at daybreak to see a man beheaded twenty in all and bran rode among them nervous with excitement this was the first time he had been deemed old enough to go with his lord father and his page brothers to see the kings justice done it was the ninth year of summer and the seventh of brans life the man had been taken outside a small holdfast in the hills robb thought he was a wildling his sword sworn to mance rayder the kingbeyondthewall it made brans skin prickle to think of it he remembered the hearth tales old nan told them the wildlings were cruel men she said slavers and slayers and thieves they consorted with giants and ghouls stole girl children in the dead of night and drank blood from polished horns and their women lay with the others in the long night to sire terrible halfhuman children but the man they found bound hand and foot to the holdfast wall awaiting the kings justice was old and scrawny not much taller than robb he had lost both ears and a finger to frostbite and he dressed all in black the same as a brother of the nights watch except that his furs were ragged and greasy the breath of man and horse mingled steaming in the cold morning air as his lord father had the man cut down from the wall and dragged before them robb and jon sat tall and still on their horses with bran between them on his pony trying to seem older than seven trying to pretend that hed seen all this before a faint wind blew through the holdfast gate over their heads flapped the banner of the starks of winterfell a grey direwolf racing across an icewhite field brans father sat solemnly on his horse long brown hair stirring in the wind his closely trimmed beard was shot with white making him look older than his thirtyfive years he had a grim cast to his grey eyes this day and he seemed not at all the man who would sit before the fire in the evening and talk softly of the age of heroes and the children of the forest he had taken off fathers face bran thought and donned the face of lord stark of winterfell there were questions asked and answers given there in the chill of morning but afterward bran could not recall much of what had been said finally his lord father gave a command and two of his guardsmen dragged the ragged man to the ironwood stump in the center of the square they forced his head down onto the hard black wood lord eddard stark dismounted and his ward theon greyjoy brought forth the sword ice that sword was called it was as wide across as a mans hand and taller even than robb the blade was valyrian steel spellforged and dark as smoke nothing held an edge like valyrian steel his father peeled off his gloves and handed them to jory cassel the captain of his household guard he took hold of ice with both hands and said in the name of robert of the house baratheon the first of his name king of the andals and the rhoynar and the first men lord of the seven kingdoms and protector of the realm by the word of eddard of the house stark lord of winterfell and warden of the north i do sentence you to die he lifted the greatsword high above his head brans bastard brother jon snow moved closer keep the pony well in hand he whispered and dont look away father will know if you do bran kept his pony well in hand and did not look away his father took off the mans head with a single sure stroke blood sprayed out across the snow as red as surnmerwine one of the horses reared and had to be restrained to keep from bolting bran could not take his eyes off the blood the snows around the stump drank it eagerly reddening as he watched the head bounced off a thick root and rolled it came up near greyjoys feet theon was a lean dark page youth of nineteen who found everything amusing he laughed put his boot on the head and kicked it away ass jon muttered low enough so greyjoy did not hear he put a hand on brans shoulder and bran looked over at his bastard brother you did well jon told him solemnly jon was fourteen an old hand at justice it seemed colder on the long ride back to winterfell though the wind had died by then and the sun was higher in the sky bran rode with his brothers well ahead of the main party his pony struggling hard to keep up with their horses the deserter died bravely robb said he was big and broad and growing every day with his mothers coloring the fair skin redbrown hair and blue eyes of the tullys of riverrun he had courage at the least no jon snow said quietly it was not courage this one was dead of fear you could see it in his eyes stark jons eyes were a grey so dark they seemed almost black but there was little they did not see he was of an age with robb but they did not look alike jon was slender where robb was muscular dark where robb was fair graceful and quick where his half brother was strong and fast robb was not impressed the others take his eyes he swore he died well race you to the bridge done jon said kicking his horse forward robb cursed and followed and they galloped off down the trail robb laughing and hooting jon silent and intent the hooves of their horses kicked up showers of snow as they went bran did not try to follow his pony could not keep up he had seen the ragged mans eyes and he was thinking of them now after a while the sound of robbs laughter receded and the woods grew silent again so deep in thought was he that he never heard the rest of the party until his father moved up to ride beside him are you well bran he asked not unkindly yes father bran told him he looked up wrapped in his furs and leathers mounted on his great warhorse his lord father loomed over him like a giant robb says the man died bravely but jon says he was afraid what do you think his father asked bran thought about it can a man still be brave if hes afraid that is the only time a man can be brave his father told him do you understand why i did it he was a wildling bran said they carry off women and sell them to the others his lord father smiled old nan has been telling you stories again in truth the man was an oathbreaker a deserter from the nights watch no man is more dangerous the deserter knows his life is forfeit if he is taken so he will not flinch from any crime no matter how vile but you mistake me the question was not why the man had to die but why i must do it page bran had no answer for that king robert has a headsman he said uncertainly he does his father admitted as did the targaryen kings before him yet our way is the older way the blood of the first men still flows in the veins of the starks and we hold to the belief that the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword if you would take a mans life you owe it to him to look into his eyes and hear his final words and if you cannot bear to do that then perhaps the man does not deserve to die one day bran you will be robbs bannerman holding a keep of your own for your brother and your king and justice will fall to you when that day comes you must take no pleasure in the task but neither must you look away a ruler who hides behind paid executioners soon forgets what death is that was when jon reappeared on the crest of the hill before them he waved and shouted down at them father bran come quickly see what robb has found then he was gone again jory rode up beside them trouble my lord beyond a doubt his lord father said come let us see what mischief my sons have rooted out now he sent his horse into a trot jory and bran and the rest came after they found robb on the riverbank north of the bridge with jon still mounted beside him the late summer snows had been heavy this moonturn robb stood kneedeep in white his hood pulled back so the sun shone in his hair he was cradling something in his arm while the boys talked in hushed excited voices the riders picked their way carefully through the drifts groping for solid footing on the hidden uneven ground jory cassel and theon greyjoy were the first to reach the boys greyjoy was laughing and joking as he rode bran heard the breath go out of him gods he exclaimed struggling to keep control of his horse as he reached for his sword jorys sword was already out robb get away from it he called as his horse reared under him robb grinned and looked up from the bundle in his arms she cant hurt you he said shes dead jory bran was afire with curiosity by then he would have spurred the pony faster but his father made them dismount beside the bridge and approach on foot bran jumped off and ran by then jon jory and theon greyjoy had all dismounted as well what in the seven hells is it greyjoy was saying a wolf robb told him a freak greyjoy said look at the size of it brans heart was thumping in his chest as he pushed through a waisthigh drift to his brothers side halfburied in bloodstained snow a huge dark shape slumped in death ice had formed in its shaggy grey fur and the faint smell of corruption clung to it like a womans perfume bran glimpsed blind eyes crawling with maggots a wide mouth full of yellowed teeth but it was the size of it that made him gasp it was bigger than his pony twice the size of the largest hound in his fathers kennel page its no freak jon said calmly thats a direwolf they grow larger than the other kind theon greyjoy said theres not been a direwolf sighted south of the wall in two hundred years i see one now jon replied bran tore his eyes away from the monster that was when he noticed the bundle in robbs arms he gave a cry of delight and moved closer the pup was a tiny ball of greyblack fur its eyes still closed it nuzzled blindly against robbs chest as he cradled it searching for milk among his leathers making a sad little whimpery sound bran reached out hesitantly go on robb told him you can touch him bran gave the pup a quick nervous stroke then turned as jon said here you go his half brother put a second pup into his arms there are five of them bran sat down in the snow and hugged the wolf pup to his face its fur was soft and warm against his cheek direwolves loose in the realm after so many years muttered hullen the master of horse i like it not it is a sign jory said father frowned this is only a dead animal jory he said yet he seemed troubled snow crunched under his boots as he moved around the body do we know what killed her theres something in the throat robb told him proud to have found the answer before his father even asked there just under the jaw his father knelt and groped under the beasts head with his hand he gave a yank and held it up for all to see a foot of shattered antler tines snapped off all wet with blood a sudden silence descended over the party the men looked at the antler uneasily and no one dared to speak even bran could sense their fear though he did not understand his father tossed the antler to the side and cleansed his hands in the snow im surprised she lived long enough to whelp he said his voice broke the spell maybe she didnt jory said ive heard tales maybe the bitch was already dead when the pups came born with the dead another man put in worse luck no matter said hullen they be dead soon enough too bran gave a wordless cry of dismay the sooner the better theon greyjoy agreed he drew his sword give the beast here bran the little thing squirmed against him as if it heard and understood no bran cried out fiercely its mine page put away your sword greyjoy robb said for a moment he sounded as commanding as their father like the lord he would someday be we will keep these pups you cannot do that boy said harwin who was hullens son it be a mercy to kill them hullen said bran looked to his lord father for rescue but got only a frown a furrowed brow hullen speaks truly son better a swift death than a hard one from cold and starvation no he could feel tears welling in his eyes and he looked away he did not want to cry in front of his father robb resisted stubbornly ser rodriks red bitch whelped again last week he said it was a small litter only two live pups shell have milk enough shell rip them apart when they try to nurse lord stark jon said it was strange to hear him call father that so formal bran looked at him with desperate hope there are five pups he told father three male two female what of it jon you have five trueborn children jon said three sons two daughters the direwolf is the sigil of your house your children were meant to have these pups my lord bran saw his fathers face change saw the other men exchange glances he loved jon with all his heart at that moment even at seven bran understood what his brother had done the count had come right only because jon had omitted himself he had included the girls included even rickon the baby but not the bastard who bore the surname snow the name that custom decreed be given to all those in the north unlucky enough to be born with no name of their own their father understood as well you want no pup for yourself jon he asked softly the direwolf graces the banners of house stark jon pointed out i am no stark father their lord father regarded jon thoughtfully robb rushed into the silence he left i will nurse him myself father he promised i will soak a towel with warm milk and give him suck from that me too bran echoed the lord weighed his sons long and carefully with his eyes easy to say and harder to do i will not have you wasting the servants time with this if you want these pups you will feed them yourselves is that understood bran nodded eagerly the pup squirmed in his grasp licked at his face with a warm tongue you must train them as well their father said you must train them the kennelmaster will have nothing to do with these monsters i promise you that and the gods help you if you neglect them or brutalize them or train them badly these are not dogs to beg for treats and slink off at a kick a direwolf will rip page a mans arm off his shoulder as easily as a dog will kill a rat are you sure you want this yes father bran said yes robb agreed the pups may die anyway despite all you do they wont die robb said we wont let them die keep them then jory desmond gather up the other pups its time we were back to winterfell it was not until they were mounted and on their way that bran allowed himself to taste the sweet air of victory by then his pup was snuggled inside his leathers warm against him safe for the long ride home bran was wondering what to name him halfway across the bridge jon pulled up suddenly what is it jon their lord father asked cant you hear it bran could hear the wind in the trees the clatter of their hooves on the ironwood planks the whimpering of his hungry pup but jon was listening to something else there jon said he swung his horse around and galloped back across the bridge they watched him dismount where the direwolf lay dead in the snow watched him kneel a moment later he was riding back to them smiling he must have crawled away from the others jon said or been driven away their father said looking at the sixth pup his fur was white where the rest of the litter was grey his eyes were as red as the blood of the ragged man who had died that morning bran thought it curious that this pup alone would have opened his eyes while the others were still blind an albino theon greyjoy said with wry amusement this one will die even faster than the others jon snow gave his fathers ward a long chilling look i think not greyjoy he said this one belongs to me catelyn catelyn had never liked this godswood she had been born a tully at riverrun far to the south on the red fork of the trident the godswood there was a garden bright and airy where tall redwoods spread dappled shadows across tinkling streams birds sang from hidden nests and the air was spicy with the scent of flowers page the gods of winterfell kept a different sort of wood it was a dark primal place three acres of old forest untouched for ten thousand years as the gloomy castle rose around it it smelled of moist earth and decay no redwoods grew here this was a wood of stubborn sentinel trees armored in greygreen needles of mighty oaks of ironwoods as old as the realm itself here thick black trunks crowded close together while twisted branches wove a dense canopy overhead and misshappen roots wrestled beneath the soil this was a place of deep silence and brooding shadows and the gods who lived here had no names but she knew she would find her husband here tonight whenever he took a mans life afterward he would seek the quiet of the godswood catelyn had been anointed with the seven oils and named in the rainbow of light that filled the sept of riverrun she was of the faith like her father and grandfather and his father before him her gods had names and their faces were as familiar as the faces of her parents worship was a septon with a censer the smell of incense a sevensided crystal alive with light voices raised in song the tullys kept a godswood as all the great houses did but it was only a place to walk or read or lie in the sun worship was for the sept for her sake ned had built a small sept where she might sing to the seven faces of god but the blood of the first men still flowed in the veins of the starks and his own gods were the old ones the nameless faceless gods of the greenwood they shared with the vanished children of the forest at the center of the grove an ancient weirwood brooded over a small pool where the waters were black and cold the heart tree ned called it the weirwoods bark was white as bone its leaves dark red like a thousand bloodstained hands a face had been carved in the trunk of the great tree its features long and melancholy the deepcut eyes red with dried sap and strangely watchful they were old those eyes older than winterfell itself they had seen brandon the builder set the first stone if the tales were true they had watched the castles granite walls rise around them it was said that the children of the forest had carved the faces in the trees during the dawn centuries before the coming of the first men across the narrow sea in the south the last weirwoods had been cut down or burned out a thousand years ago except on the isle of faces where the green men kept their silent watch up here it was different here every castle had its godswood and every godswood had its heart tree and every heart tree its face catelyn found her husband beneath the weirwood seated on a mosscovered stone the greatsword ice was across his lap and he was cleaning the blade in those waters black as night a thousand years of humus lay thick upon the godswood floor swallowing the sound of her feet but the red eyes of the weirwood seemed to follow her as she came ned she called softly he lifted his head to look at her catelyn he said his voice was distant and formal where are the children he would always ask her that in the kitchen arguing about names for the wolf pups she spread her cloak on the forest floor and sat beside the pool her back to the weirwood she could feel the eyes watching her but she did her best to ignore them arya is already in love and sansa is charmed and gracious but rickon is not quite sure is he afraid ned asked page a little she admitted he is only three ned frowned he must learn to face his fears he will not be three forever and winter is coming yes catelyn agreed the words gave her a chill as they always did the stark words every noble house had its words family mottoes touchstones prayers of sorts they boasted of honor and glory promised loyalty and truth swore faith and courage all but the starks winter is coming said the stark words not for the first time she reflected on what a strange people these northerners were the man died well ill give him that ned said he had a swatch of oiled leather in one hand he ran it lightly up the greatsword as he spoke polishing the metal to a dark glow i was glad for brans sake you would have been proud of bran i am always proud of bran catelyn replied watching the sword as he stroked it she could see the rippling deep within the steel where the metal had been folded back on itself a hundred times in the forging catelyn had no love for swords but she could not deny that ice had its own beauty it had been forged in valyria before the doom had come to the old freehold when the ironsmiths had worked their metal with spells as well as hammers four hundred years old it was and as sharp as the day it was forged the name it bore was older still a legacy from the age of heroes when the starks were kings in the north he was the fourth this year ned said grimly the poor man was halfmad something had put a fear in him so deep that my words could not reach him he sighed ben writes that the strength of the nights watch is down below a thousand its not only desertions they are losing men on rangings as well is it the wildlings she asked who else ned lifted ice looked down the cool steel length of it and it will only grow worse the day may come when i will have no choice but to call the banners and ride north to deal with this kingbeyondthewall for good and all beyond the wall the thought made catelyn shudder ned saw the dread on her face mance rayder is nothing for us to fear there are darker things beyond the wall she glanced behind her at the heart tree the pale bark and red eyes watching listening thinking its long slow thoughts his smile was gentle you listen to too many of old nans stories the others are as dead as the children of the forest gone eight thousand years maester luwin will tell you they never lived at all no living man has ever seen one until this morning no living man had ever seen a direwolf either catelyn reminded him i ought to know better than to argue with a tully he said with a rueful smile he slid ice back into its sheath you did not come here to tell me crib tales i know how little you like this place what is it my lady catelyn took her husbands hand there was grievous news today my lord i did not wish to trouble you until you had cleansed yourself there was no way to soften the blow so she told him straight i am page so sorry my love jon arryn is dead his eyes found hers and she could see how hard it took him as she had known it would in his youth ned had fostered at the eyrie and the childless lord arryn had become a second father to him and his fellow ward robert baratheon when the mad king aerys targaryen had demanded their heads the lord of the eyrie had raised his moonandfalcon banners in revolt rather than give up those he had pledged to protect and one day fifteen years ago this second father had become a brother as well as he and ned stood together in the sept at riverrun to wed two sisters the daughters of lord hoster tully jon he said is this news certain it was the kings seal and the letter is in roberts own hand i saved it for you he said lord arryn was taken quickly even maester pycelle was helpless but he brought the milk of the poppy so jon did not linger long in pain that is some small mercy i suppose he said she could see the grief on his face but even then he thought first of her your sister he said and jons boy what word of them the message said only that they were well and had returned to the eyrie catelyn said i wish they had gone to riverrun instead the eyrie is high and lonely and it was ever her husbands place not hers lord jons memory will haunt each stone i know my sister she needs the comfort of family and friends around her your uncle waits in the vale does he not jon named him knight of the gate id heard catelyn nodded brynden will do what he can for her and for the boy that is some comfort but still go to her ned urged take the children fill her halls with noise and shouts and laughter that boy of hers needs other children about him and lysa should not be alone in her grief would that i could catelyn said the letter had other tidings the king is riding to winterfell to seek you out it took ned a moment to comprehend her words but when the understanding came the darkness left his eyes robert is coming here when she nodded a smile broke across his face catelyn wished she could share his joy but she had heard the talk in the yards a direwolf dead in the snow a broken antler in its throat dread coiled within her like a snake but she forced herself to smile at this man she loved this man who put no faith in signs i knew that would please you she said we should send word to your brother on the wall yes of course he agreed ben will want to be here i shall tell maester luwin to send his swiftest bird ned rose and pulled her to her feet damnation how many years has it been and he gives us no more notice than this how many in his party did the message say i should think a hundred knights at the least with all their retainers and half again as many freeriders page cersei and the children travel with them robert will keep an easy pace for their sakes he said it is just as well that will give us more time to prepare the queens brothers are also in the party she told him ned grimaced at that there was small love between him and the queens family catelyn knew the lannisters of casterly rock had come late to roberts cause when victory was all but certain and he had never forgiven them well if the price for roberts company is an infestation of lannisters so be it it sounds as though robert is bringing half his court where the king goes the realm follows she said it will be good to see the children the youngest was still sucking at the lannister womans teat the last time i saw him he must be what five by now prince tornmen is seven she told him the same age as bran please ned guard your tongue the lannister woman is our queen and her pride is said to grow with every passing year ned squeezed her hand there must be a feast of course with singers and robert will want to hunt i shall send jory south with an honor guard to meet them on the kingsroad and escort them back gods how are we going to feed them all on his way already you said damn the man damn his royal hide daenerys her brother held the gown up for her inspection this is beauty touch it go on caress the fabric dany touched it the cloth was so smooth that it seemed to run through her fingers like water she could not remember ever wearing anything so soft it frightened her she pulled her hand away is it really mine a gift from the magister illyrio viserys said smiling her brother was in a high mood tonight the color will bring out the violet in your eyes and you shall have gold as well and jewels of all sorts illyrio has promised tonight you must look like a princess a princess dany thought she had forgotten what that was like perhaps she had never really known why does he give us so much she asked what does he want from us for nigh on half a year they had lived in the magisters house eating his food pampered by his servants dany was thirteen old enough to know that such gifts seldom come without their price here in the free city of pentos illyrio is no fool viserys said he was a gaunt young man with nervous hands and a feverish look in his pale lilac eyes the magister knows that i will not forget my friends when i come into my throne dany said nothing magister illyrio was a dealer in spices gemstones dragonbone and other less savory things he had friends in all of the nine free cities it was said and even beyond in vaes dothrak and the fabled lands beside the jade sea it was also said that hed never had a friend he wouldnt page cheerfully sell for the right price dany listened to the talk in the streets and she heard these things but she knew better than to question her brother when he wove his webs of dream his anger was a terrible thing when roused viserys called it waking the dragon her brother hung the gown beside the door illyrio will send the slaves to bathe you be sure you wash off the stink of the stables khal drogo has a thousand horses tonight he looks for a different sort of mount he studied her critically you still slouch straighten yourself he pushed back her shoulders with his hands let them see that you have a womans shape now his fingers brushed lightly over her budding breasts and tightened on a nipple you will not fail me tonight if you do it will go hard for you you dont want to wake the dragon do you his fingers twisted her the pinch cruelly hard through the rough fabric of her tunic do you he repeated no dany said meekly her brother smiled good he touched her hair almost with affection when they write the history of my reign sweet sister they will say that it began tonight when he was gone dany went to her window and looked out wistfully on the waters of the bay the square brick towers of pentos were black silhouettes outlined against the setting sun dany could hear the singing of the red priests as they lit their night fires and the shouts of ragged children playing games beyond the walls of the estate for a moment she wished she could be out there with them barefoot and breathless and dressed in tatters with no past and no future and no feast to attend at khal drogos manse somewhere beyond the sunset across the narrow sea lay a land of green hills and flowered plains and great rushing rivers where towers of dark stone rose amidst magnificent bluegrey mountains and armored knights rode to battle beneath the banners of their lords the dothraki called that land rhaesh andahli the land of the andals in the free cities they talked of westeros and the sunset kingdoms her brother had a simpler name our land he called it the words were like a prayer with him if he said them enough the gods were sure to hear ours by blood right taken from us by treachery but ours still ours forever you do not steal from the dragon oh no the dragon remembers and perhaps the dragon did remember but dany could not she had never seen this land her brother said was theirs this realm beyond the narrow sea these places he talked of casterly rock and the eyrie highgarden and the vale of arryn dorne and the isle of faces they were just words to her viserys had been a boy of eight when they fled kings landing to escape the advancing armies of the usurper but daenerys had been only a quickening in their mothers womb yet sometimes dany would picture the way it had been so often had her brother told her the stories the midnight flight to dragonstone moonlight shimmering on the ships black sails her brother rhaegar battling the usurper in the bloody waters of the trident and dying for the woman he loved the sack of kings landing by the ones viserys called the usurpers dogs the lords lannister and stark princess elia of dorne pleading for mercy as rhaegars heir was ripped from her breast and murdered before her eyes the polished skulls of the last dragons staring down sightlessly from the walls of the throne room while the kingslayer opened fathers throat with a golden sword she had been born on dragonstone nine moons after their flight while a raging summer storm threatened to rip the island fastness apart they said that storm was terrible the targaryen fleet was smashed while it lay at anchor and huge stone blocks were ripped from the parapets and sent hurtling into the wild waters of the narrow sea her mother had died birthing her and for that her brother viserys had never page forgiven her she did not remember dragonstone either they had run again just before the usurpers brother set sail with his newbuilt fleet by then only dragonstone itself the ancient seat of their house had remained of the seven kingdoms that had once been theirs it would not remain for long the garrison had been prepared to sell them to the usurper but one night ser willem darry and four loyal men had broken into the nursery and stolen them both along with her wet nurse and set sail under cover of darkness for the safety of the braavosian coast she remembered ser willem dimly a great grey bear of a man halfblind roaring and bellowing orders from his sickbed the servants had lived in terror of him but he had always been kind to dany he called her little princess and sometimes my lady and his hands were soft as old leather he never left his bed though and the smell of sickness clung to him day and night a hot moist sickly sweet odor that was when they lived in braavos in the big house with the red door dany had her own room there with a lemon tree outside her window after ser willem had died the servants had stolen what little money they had left and soon after they had been put out of the big house dany had cried when the red door closed behind them forever they had wandered since then from braavos to myr from myr to tyrosh and on to qohor and volantis and lys never staying long in any one place her brother would not allow it the usurpers hired knives were close behind them he insisted though dany had never seen one at first the magisters and archons and merchant princes were pleased to welcome the last targaryens to their homes and tables but as the years passed and the usurper continued to sit upon the iron throne doors closed and their lives grew meaner years past they had been forced to sell their last few treasures and now even the coin they had gotten from mothers crown had gone in the alleys and wine sinks of pentos they called her brother the beggar king dany did not want to know what they called her we will have it all back someday sweet sister he would promise her sometimes his hands shook when he talked about it the jewels and the silks dragonstone and kings landing the iron throne and the seven kingdoms all they have taken from us we will have it back viserys lived for that day all that daenerys wanted back was the big house with the red door the lemon tree outside her window the childhood she had never known there came a soft knock on her door come dany said turning away from the window illyrios servants entered bowed and set about their business they were slaves a gift from one of the magisters many dothraki friends there was no slavery in the free city of pentos nonetheless they were slaves the old woman small and grey as a mouse never said a word but the girl made up for it she was illyrios favorite a fairhaired blueeyed wench of sixteen who chattered constantly as she worked they filled her bath with hot water brought up from the kitchen and scented it with fragrant oils the girl pulled the rough cotton tunic over danys head and helped her into the tub the water was scalding hot but daenerys did not flinch or cry out she liked the heat it made her feel clean besides her brother had often told her that it was never too hot for a targaryen ours is the house of the dragon he would say the fire is in our blood the old woman washed her long silverpale hair and gently combed out the snags all in silence the girl scrubbed her back and her feet and told her how lucky she was drogo is so rich that even his slaves page wear golden collars a hundred thousand men ride in his khalasar and his palace in vaes dothrak has two hundred rooms and doors of solid silver there was more like that so much more what a handsome man the khal was so tall and fierce fearless in battle the best rider ever to mount a horse a demon archer daenerys said nothing she had always assumed that she would wed viserys when she came of age for centuries the targaryens had married brother to sister since aegon the conqueror had taken his sisters to bride the line must be kept pure viserys had told her a thousand times theirs was the kingsblood the golden blood of old valyria the blood of the dragon dragons did not mate with the beasts of the field and targaryens did not mingle their blood with that of lesser men yet now viserys schemed to sell her to a stranger a barbarian when she was clean the slaves helped her from the water and toweled her dry the girl brushed her hair until it shone like molten silver while the old woman anointed her with the spiceflower perfume of the dothraki plains a dab on each wrist behind her ears on the tips of her breasts and one last one cool on her lips down there between her legs they dressed her in the wisps that magister illyrio had sent up and then the gown a deep plum silk to bring out the violet in her eyes the girl slid the gilded sandals onto her feet while the old woman fixed the tiara in her hair and slid golden bracelets crusted with amethysts around her wrists last of all came the collar a heavy golden tore emblazoned with ancient valyrian glyphs now you look all a princess the girl said breathlessly when they were done dany glanced at her image in the silvered looking glass that illyrio had so thoughtfully provided a princess she thought but she remembered what the girl had said how khal drogo was so rich even his slaves wore golden collars she felt a sudden chill and gooseflesh pimpled her bare arms her brother was waiting in the cool of the entry hall seated on the edge of the pool his hand trailing in the water he rose when she appeared and looked her over critically stand there he told her turn around yes good you look regal magister illyrio said stepping through an archway he moved with surprising delicacy for such a massive man beneath loose garments of flamecolored silk rolls of fat jiggled as he walked gemstones glittered on every finger and his man had oiled his forked yellow beard until it shone like real gold may the lord of light shower you with blessings on this most fortunate day princess daenerys the magister said as he took her hand he bowed his head showing a thin glimpse of crooked yellow teeth through the gold of his beard she is a vision your grace a vision he told her brother drogo will be enraptured shes too skinny viserys said his hair the same silverblond as hers had been pulled back tightly behind his head and fastened with a dragonbone brooch it was a severe look that emphasized the hard gaunt lines of his face he rested his hand on the hilt of the sword that illyrio had lent him and said are you sure that khal drogo likes his women this young she has had her blood she is old enough for the khal illyrio told him not for the first time look at her that silvergold hair those purple eyes she is the blood of old valyria no doubt no doubt and highborn daughter of the old king sister to the new she cannot fail to entrance our drogo when he released her hand daenerys found herself trembling page i suppose her brother said doubtfully the savages have queer tastes boys horses sheep best not suggest this to khal drogo illyrio said anger flashed in her brothers lilac eyes do you take me for a fool the magister bowed slightly i take you for a king kings lack the caution of common men my apologies if i have given offense he turned away and clapped his hands for his bearers the streets of pentos were pitchdark when they set out in illyrios elaborately carved palanquin two servants went ahead to light their way carrying ornate oil lanterns with panes of pale blue glass while a dozen strong men hoisted the poles to their shoulders it was warm and close inside behind the curtains dany could smell the stench of illyrios pallid flesh through his heavy perfumes her brother sprawled out on his pillows beside her never noticed his mind was away across the narrow sea we wont need his whole khalasar viserys said his fingers toyed with the hilt of his borrowed blade though dany knew he had never used a sword in earnest ten thousand that would be enough i could sweep the seven kingdoms with ten thousand dothraki screamers the realm will rise for its rightful king tyrell redwyne darry greyjoy they have no more love for the usurper than i do the dornishmen burn to avenge elia and her children and the smallfolk will be with us they cry out for their king he looked at illyrio anxiously they do dont they they are your people and they love you well magister illyrio said amiably in holdfasts all across the realm men lift secret toasts to your health while women sew dragon banners and hide them against the day of your return from across the water he gave a massive shrug or so my agents tell me dany had no agents no way of knowing what anyone was doing or thinking across the narrow sea but she mistrusted illyrios sweet words as she mistrusted everything about illyrio her brother was nodding eagerly however i shall kill the usurper myself he promised who had never killed anyone as he killed my brother rhaegar and lannister too the kingslayer for what he did to my father that would be most fitting magister illyrio said dany saw the smallest hint of a smile playing around his full lips but her brother did not notice nodding he pushed back a curtain and stared off into the night and dany knew he was fighting the battle of the trident once again the ninetowered manse of khal drogo sat beside the waters of the bay its high brick walls overgrown with pale ivy it had been given to the khal by the magisters of pentos illyrio told them the free cities were always generous with the horselords it is not that we fear these barbarians illyrio would explain with a smile the lord of light would hold our city walls against a million dothraki or so the red priests promise yet why take chances when their friendship comes so cheap their palanquin was stopped at the gate the curtains pulled roughly back by one of the house guards he had the copper skin and dark almond eyes of a dothraki but his face was hairless and he wore the spiked bronze cap of the unsullied he looked them over coldly magister illyrio growled something to him in the rough dothraki tongue the guardsman replied in the same voice and waved them through the gates dany noticed that her brothers hand was clenched tightly around the hilt of his borrowed sword he page looked almost as frightened as she felt insolent eunuch viserys muttered as the palanquin lurched up toward the manse magister illyrios words were honey many important men will be at the feast tonight such men have enemies the khal must protect his guests yourself chief among them your grace no doubt the usurper would pay well for your head oh yes viserys said darkly he has tried illyrio i promise you that his hired knives follow us everywhere i am the last dragon and he will not sleep easy while i live the palanquin slowed and stopped the curtains were thrown back and a slave offered a hand to help daenerys out his collar she noted was ordinary bronze her brother followed one hand still clenched hard around his sword hilt it took two strong men to get magister illyrio back on his feet inside the manse the air was heavy with the scent of spices pinchfire and sweet lemon and cinnamon they were escorted across the entry hall where a mosaic of colored glass depicted the doom of valyria oil burned in black iron lanterns all along the walls beneath an arch of twining stone leaves a eunuch sang their coming viserys of the house targaryen the third of his name he called in a high sweet voice king of the andals and the rhoynar and the first men lord of the seven kingdoms and protector of the realm his sister daenerys stormborn princess of dragonstone his honorable host illyrio mopatis magister of the free city of pentos they stepped past the eunuch into a pillared courtyard overgrown in pale ivy moonlight painted the leaves in shades of bone and silver as the guests drifted among them many were dothraki horselords big men with redbrown skin their drooping mustachios bound in metal rings their black hair oiled and braided and hung with bells yet among them moved bravos and sellswords from pentos and myr and tyrosh a red priest even fatter than illyrio hairy men from the port of ibben and lords from the summer isles with skin as black as ebony daenerys looked at them all in wonder and realized with a sudden start of fear that she was the only woman there illyrio whispered to them those three are drogos bloodriders there he said by the pillar is khal moro with his son rhogoro the man with the green beard is brother to the archon of tyrosh and the man behind him is ser jorah mormont the last name caught daenerys a knight no less illyrio smiled through his beard anointed with the seven oils by the high septon himself what is he doing here she blurted the usurper wanted his head illyrio told them some trifling affront he sold some poachers to a tyroshi slaver instead of giving them to the nights watch absurd law a man should be able to do as he likes with his own chattel i shall wish to speak with ser jorah before the night is done her brother said dany found herself looking at the knight curiously he was an older man past forty and balding but still strong and fit instead of silks and cottons he wore wool and leather his tunic was a dark green embroidered with the likeness of a black bear standing on two legs she was still looking at this strange man from the homeland she had never known when magister illyrio page placed a moist hand on her bare shoulder over there sweet princess he whispered there is the khal himself dany wanted to run and hide but her brother was looking at her and if she displeased him she knew she would wake the dragon anxiously she turned and looked at the man viserys hoped would ask to wed her before the night was done the slave girl had not been far wrong she thought khal drogo was a head taller than the tallest man in the room yet somehow light on his feet as graceful as the panther in illyrios menagerie he was younger than shed thought no more than thirty his skin was the color of polished copper his thick mustachios bound with gold and bronze rings i must go and make my submissions magister illyrio said wait here i shall bring him to you her brother took her by the arm as illyrio waddled over to the khal his fingers squeezing so hard that they hurt do you see his braid sweet sister drogos braid was black as midnight and heavy with scented oil hung with tiny bells that rang softly as he moved it swung well past his belt below even his buttocks the end of it brushing against the back of his thighs you see how long it is viserys said when dothraki are defeated in combat they cut off their braids in disgrace so the world will know their shame khal drogo has never lost a fight he is aegon the dragonlord come again and you will be his queen dany looked at khal drogo his face was hard and cruel his eyes as cold and dark as onyx her brother hurt her sometimes when she woke the dragon but he did not frighten her the way this man frightened her i dont want to be his queen she heard herself say in a small thin voice please please viserys i dont want to i want to go home home he kept his voice low but she could hear the fury in his tone how are we to go home sweet sister they took our home from us he drew her into the shadows out of sight his fingers digging into her skin how are we to go home he repeated meaning kings landing and dragonstone and all the realm they had lost dany had only meant their rooms in illyrios estate no true home surely though all they had but her brother did not want to hear that there was no home there for him even the big house with the red door had not been home for him his fingers dug hard into her arm demanding an answer i dont know she said at last her voice breaking tears welled in her eyes i do he said sharply we go home with an army sweet sister with khal drogos army that is how we go home and if you must wed him and bed him for that you will he smiled at her id let his whole khalasar fuck you if need be sweet sister all forty thousand men and their horses too if that was what it took to get my army be grateful it is only drogo in time you may even learn to like him now dry your eyes illyrio is bringing him over and he will not see you crying dany turned and saw that it was true magister illyrio all smiles and bows was escorting khal drogo over to where they stood she brushed away unfallen tears with the back of her hand page smile viserys whispered nervously his hand failing to the hilt of his sword and stand up straight let him see that you have breasts gods know you have little enough as is daenerys smiled and stood up straight eddard the visitors poured through the castle gates in a river of gold and silver and polished steel three hundred strong a pride of bannermen and knights of sworn swords and freeriders over their heads a dozen golden banners whipped back and forth in the northern wind emblazoned with the crowned stag of baratheon ned knew many of the riders there came ser jaime lannister with hair as bright as beaten gold and there sandor clegane with his terrible burned face the tall boy beside him could only be the crown prince and that stunted little man behind them was surely the imp tyrion lannister yet the huge man at the head of the column flanked by two knights in the snowwhite cloaks of the kingsguard seemed almost a stranger to ned until he vaulted off the back of his warhorse with a familiar roar and crushed him in a bonecrunching hug ned ah but it is good to see that frozen face of yours the king looked him over top to bottom and laughed you have not changed at all would that ned had been able to say the same fifteen years past when they had ridden forth to win a throne the lord of storms end had been cleanshaven cleareyed and muscled like a maidens fantasy six and a half feet tall he towered over lesser men and when he donned his armor and the great antlered helmet of his house he became a veritable giant hed had a giants strength too his weapon of choice a spiked iron warhammer that ned could scarcely lift in those days the smell of leather and blood had clung to him like perfume now it was perfume that clung to him like perfume and he had a girth to match his height ned had last seen the king nine years before during balon greyjoys rebellion when the stag and the direwolf had joined to end the pretensions of the selfproclaimed king of the iron islands since the night they had stood side by side in greyjoys fallen stronghold where robert had accepted the rebel lords surrender and ned had taken his son theon as hostage and ward the king had gained at least eight stone a beard as coarse and black as iron wire covered his jaw to hide his double chin and the sag of the royal jowls but nothing could hide his stomach or the dark circles under his eyes yet robert was neds king now and not just a friend so he said only your grace winterfell is yours by then the others were dismounting as well and grooms were coming forward for their mounts roberts queen cersei lannister entered on foot with her younger children the wheelhouse in which they had ridden a huge doubledecked carriage of oiled oak and gilded metal pulled by forty heavy draft horses was too wide to pass through the castle gate ned knelt in the snow to kiss the queens ring while robert embraced catelyn like a longlost sister then the children had been brought forward introduced and approved of by both sides no sooner had those formalities of greeting been completed than the king had said to his host take me down to your crypt eddard i would pay my respects page ned loved him for that for remembering her still after all these years he called for a lantern no other words were needed the queen had begun to protest they had been riding since dawn everyone was tired and cold surely they should refresh themselves first the dead would wait she had said no more than that robert had looked at her and her twin brother jaime had taken her quietly by the arm and she had said no more they went down to the crypt together ned and this king he scarcely recognized the winding stone steps were narrow ned went first with the lantern i was starting to think we would never reach winterfell robert complained as they descended in the south the way they talk about my seven kingdoms a man forgets that your part is as big as the other six combined i trust you enjoyed the journey your grace robert snorted bogs and forests and fields and scarcely a decent inn north of the neck ive never seen such a vast emptiness where are all yourpeople likely they were too shy to come out ned jested he could feel the chill coming up the stairs a cold breath from deep within the earth kings are a rare sight in the north robert snorted more likely they were hiding under the snow snow ned the king put one hand on the wall to steady himself as they descended late summer snows are common enough ned said i hope they did not trouble you they are usually mild the others take your mild snows robert swore what will this place be like in winter i shudder to think the winters are hard ned admitted but the starks will endure we always have you need to come south robert told him you need a taste of summer before it flees in highgarden there are fields of golden roses that stretch away as far as the eye can see the fruits are so ripe they explode in your mouthmelons peaches fireplums youve never tasted such sweetness youll see i brought you some even at storms end with that good wind off the bay the days are so hot you can barely move and you ought to see the towns ned flowers everywhere the markets bursting with food the surnmerwines so cheap and so good that you can get drunk just breathing the air everyone is fat and drunk and rich he laughed and slapped his own ample stomach a thump and the girls ned he exclaimed his eyes sparkling i swear women lose all modesty in the heat they swim naked in the river right beneath the castle even in the streets its too damn hot for wool or fur so they go around in these short gowns silk if they have the silver and cotton if not but its all the same when they start sweating and the cloth sticks to their skin they might as well be naked the king laughed happily robert baratheon had always been a man of huge appetites a man who knew how to take his pleasures that was not a charge anyone could lay at the door of eddard stark yet ned could not help but notice that those pleasures were taking a toll on the king robert was breathing heavily by the time they reached the bottom of the stairs his face red in the lantern light as they stepped out into the darkness of the crypt your grace ned said respectfully he swept the lantern in a wide semicircle shadows moved and page lurched flickering light touched the stones underfoot and brushed against a long procession of granite pillars that marched ahead two by two into the dark between the pillars the dead sat on their stone thrones against the walls backs against the sepulchres that contained their mortal remains she is down at the end with father and brandon he led the way between the pillars and robert followed wordlessly shivering in the subterranean chill it was always cold down here their footsteps rang off the stones and echoed in the vault overhead as they walked among the dead of house stark the lords of winterfell watched them pass their likenesses were carved into the stones that sealed the tombs in long rows they sat blind eyes staring out into eternal darkness while great stone direwolves curled round their feet the shifting shadows made the stone figures seem to stir as the living passed by by ancient custom an iron longsword had been laid across the lap of each who had been lord of winterfell to keep the vengeful spirits in their crypts the oldest had long ago rusted away to nothing leaving only a few red stains where the metal had rested on stone ned wondered if that meant those ghosts were free to roam the castle now he hoped not the first lords of winterfell had been men hard as the land they ruled in the centuries before the dragonlords came over the sea they had sworn allegiance to no man styling themselves the kings in the north ned stopped at last and lifted the oil lantern the crypt continued on into darkness ahead of them but beyond this point the tombs were empty and unsealed black holes waiting for their dead waiting for him and his children ned did not like to think on that here he told his king robert nodded silently knelt and bowed his head there were three tombs side by side lord rickard stark neds father had a long stern face the stonemason had known him well he sat with quiet dignity stone fingers holding tight to the sword across his lap but in life all swords had failed him in two smaller sepulchres on either side were his children brandon had been twenty when he died strangled by order of the mad king aerys targaryen only a few short days before he was to wed catelyn tully of riverrun his father had been forced to watch him die he was the true heir the eldest born to rule lyanna had only been sixteen a childwoman of surpassing loveliness ned had loved her with all his heart robert had loved her even more she was to have been his bride she was more beautiful than that the king said after a silence his eyes lingered on lyannas face as if he could will her back to life finally he rose made awkward by his weight ah damn it ned did you have to bury her in a place like this his voice was hoarse with remembered grief she deserved more than darkness she was a stark of winterfell ned said quietly this is her place she should be on a hill somewhere under a fruit tree with the sun and clouds above her and the rain to wash her clean i was with her when she died ned reminded the king she wanted to come home to rest beside brandon and father he could hear her still at times promise me she had cried in a room that smelled of blood and roses promise me ned the fever had taken her strength and her voice had been faint as a page whisper but when he gave her his word the fear had gone out of his sisters eyes ned remembered the way she had smiled then how tightly her fingers had clutched his as she gave up her hold on life the rose petals spilling from her palm dead and black after that he remembered nothing they had found him still holding her body silent with grief the little crannogman howland reed had taken her hand from his ned could recall none of it i bring her flowers when i can he said lyanna was fond of flowers the king touched her cheek his fingers brushing across the rough stone as gently as if it were living flesh i vowed to kill rhaegar for what he did to her you did ned reminded him only once robert said bitterly they had come together at the ford of the trident while the battle crashed around them robert with his warhammer and his great antlered helm the targaryen prince armored all in black on his breastplate was the threeheaded dragon of his house wrought all in rubies that flashed like fire in the sunlight the waters of the trident ran red around the hooves of their destriers as they circled and clashed again and again until at last a crushing blow from roberts hammer stove in the dragon and the chest beneath it when ned had finally come on the scene rhaegar lay dead in the stream while men of both armies scrabbled in the swirling waters for rubies knocked free of his armor in my dreams i kill him every night robert admitted a thousand deaths will still be less than he deserves there was nothing ned could say to that after a quiet he said we should return your grace your wife will be waiting the others take my wife robert muttered sourly but he started back the way they had come his footsteps falling heavily and if i hear your grace once more ill have your head on a spike we are more to each other than that i had not forgotten ned replied quietly when the king did not answer he said tell me about jon robert shook his head i have never seen a man sicken so quickly we gave a tourney on my sons name day if you had seen jon then you would have sworn he would live forever a fortnight later he was dead the sickness was like a fire in his gut it burned right through him he paused beside a pillar before the tomb of a longdead stark i loved that old man we both did ned paused a moment catelyn fears for her sister how does lysa bear her grief roberts mouth gave a bitter twist not well in truth he admitted i think losing jon has driven the woman mad ned she has taken the boy back to the eyrie against my wishes i had hoped to foster him with tywin lannister at casterly rock jon had no brothers no other sons was i supposed to leave him to be raised by women ned would sooner entrust a child to a pit viper than to lord tywin but he left his doubts unspoken
