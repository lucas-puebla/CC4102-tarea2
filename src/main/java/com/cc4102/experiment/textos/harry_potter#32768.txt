harry potter and the sorcerers stonechapter onethe boy who livedmr and mrs dursley of number four privet drive were proud to say that they were perfectly normal thank you very much they were the last people youd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious because they just didnt hold with such nonsensemr dursley was the director of a firm called grunnings which made drills he was a big beefy man with hardly any neck although he did have a very large mustache mrs dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences spying on the neighbors the dursleys had a small son called dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywherethe dursleys had everything they wanted but they also had a secret and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it they didnt think they could bear it if anyone found out about the potters mrs potter was mrs dursleys sister but they hadnt met for several years in fact mrs dursley pretended she didnt have a sister because her sister and her goodfornothing husband were as undursleyish as it was possible to be the dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the potters arrived in the street the dursleys knew that the potters had a small son too but they had never even seen him this boy was another good reason for keeping the potters away they didnt want dudley mixing with a child like thatwhen mr and mrs dursley woke up on the dull gray tuesday our story starts there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country mr dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work and mrs dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming dudley into his high chairnone of them noticed a large tawny owl flutter past the windowat half past eight mr dursley picked up his briefcase pecked mrs dursley on the cheek and tried to kiss dudley goodbye but missed because dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls little tyke chortled mr dursley as he left the house he got into his car and backed out of number fours driveit was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar a cat reading a map for a second mr dursley didnt realize what he had seen then he jerked his head around to look again there was a tabby cat standing on the corner of privet drive but there wasnt a map in sight what could he have been thinking of it must have been a trick of the light mr dursley blinked and stared at the cat it stared back as mr dursley drove around the corner and up the road he watched the cat in his mirror it was now reading the sign that said privet drive no looking at the sign cats couldnt read maps or signs mr dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind as he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that daybut on the edge of town drills were driven out of his mind by something else as he sat in the usual morning traffic jam he couldnt help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about people in cloaks mr dursley couldnt bear people who dressed in funny clothes the getups you saw on young people he supposed this was some stupid new fashion he drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by they were whispering excitedly together mr dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them werent young at all why that man had to be older than he was and wearing an emeraldgreen cloak the nerve of him but then it struck mr dursley that this was probably some silly stunt these people were obviously collecting for somethingyes that would be it the traffic moved on and a few minutes later mr dursley arrived in the grunnings parking lot his mind back on drillsmr dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor if he hadnt he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning he didnt see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight though people down in the street did they pointed and gazed open mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime mr dursley however had a perfectly normal owlfree morning he yelled at five different people he made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more he was in a very good mood until lunchtime when he thought hed stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakeryhed forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the bakers he eyed them angrily as he passed he didnt know why but they made him uneasy this bunch were whispering excitedly too and he couldnt see a single collecting tin it was on his way back past them clutching a large doughnut in a bag that he caught a few words of what they were sayingthe potters thats right thats what i heard yes their son harrymr dursley stopped dead fear flooded him he looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them but thought better of ithe dashed back across the road hurried up to his office snapped at his secretary not to disturb him seized his telephone and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind he put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache thinking no he was being stupid potter wasnt such an unusual name he was sure there were lots of people called potter who had a son called harry come to think of it he wasnt even sure his nephew was called harry hed never even seen the boy it might have been harvey or harold there was no point in worrying mrs dursley she always got so upset at any mention of her sister he didnt blame her if hed had a sister like that but all the same those people in cloakshe found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five oclock he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the doorsorry he grunted as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell it was a few seconds before mr dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak he didnt seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground on the contrary his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare dont be sorry my dear sir for nothing could upset me today rejoice for youknowwho has gone at last even muggles like yourself should be celebrating this happy happy dayand the old man hugged mr dursley around the middle and walked offmr dursley stood rooted to the spot he had been hugged by a complete stranger he also thought he had been called a muggle whatever that was he was rattled he hurried to his car and set off for home hoping he was imagining things which he had never hoped before because he didnt approve of imaginationas he pulled into the driveway of number four the first thing he saw and it didnt improve his mood was the tabby cat hed spotted that morning it was now sitting on his garden wall he was sure it was the same one it had the same markings around its eyesshoo said mr dursley loudly the cat didnt move it just gave him a stern look was this normal cat behavior mr dursley wondered trying to pull himself together he let himself into the house he was still determined not to mention anything to his wifemrs dursley had had a nice normal day she told him over dinner all about mrs next doors problems with her daughter and how dudley had learned a new word wont mr dursley tried to act normally when dudley had been put to bed he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news and finally birdwatchers everywhere have reported that the nations owls have been behaving very unusually today although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern the newscaster allowed himself a grinmost mysterious and now over to jim mcguffin with the weather going to be any more showers of owls tonight jimwell ted said the weatherman i dont know about that but its not only the owls that have been acting oddly today viewers as far apart as kent yorkshire and dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain i promised yesterday theyve had a downpour of shooting stars perhaps people have been celebrating bonfire night early its not until next week folks but i can promise a wet night tonightmr dursley sat frozen in his armchair shooting stars all over britain owls flying by daylight mysterious people in cloaks all over the place and a whisper a whisper about the pottersmrs dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea it was no good hed have to say something to her he cleared his throat nervously er petunia dear you havent heard from your sister lately have youas he had expected mrs dursley looked shocked and angry after all they normally pretended she didnt have a sisterno she said sharply whyfunny stuff on the news mr dursley mumbled owls shooting stars and there were a lot of funnylooking people in town todayso snapped mrs dursleywell i just thought maybe it was something to do with you know her crowdmrs dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips mr dursley wondered whether he dared tell her hed heard the name potter he decided he didnt dare instead he said as casually as he could their son hed be about dudleys age now wouldnt hei suppose so said mrs dursley stifflywhats his name again howard isnt itharry nasty common name if you ask meoh yes said mr dursley his heart sinking horribly yes i quite agreehe didnt say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bedwhile mrs dursley was in the bathroom mr dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden the cat was still thereit was staring down privet drive as though it were waiting for somethingwas he imagining things could all this have anything to do with the potters if it did if it got out that they were related to a pair of well he didnt think he could bear itthe dursleys got into bed mrs dursley fell asleep quickly but mr dursley lay awake turning it all over in his mind his last comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the potters were involved there was no reason for them to come near him and mrs dursley the potters knew very well what he and petunia thought about them and their kind he couldnt see how he and petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on he yawned and turned over it couldnt affect themhow very wrong he wasmr dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness it was sitting as still as a statue its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of privet drive it didnt so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street nor when two owls swooped overhead in fact it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at alla man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching appeared so suddenly and silently youd have thought hed just popped out of the ground the cats tail twitched and its eyes narrowednothing like this man had ever been seen on privet drive he was tall thin and very old judging by the silver of his hair and beard which were both long enough to tuck into his belt he was wearing long robes a purple cloak that swept the ground and highheeled buckled bootshis blue eyes were light bright and sparkling behind halfmoon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked as though it had been broken at least twice this mans name was albus dumbledorealbus dumbledore didnt seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome he was busy rummaging in his cloak looking for something but he did seem to realize he was being watched because he looked up suddenly at the cat which was still staring at him from the other end of the street for some reason the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him he chuckled and muttered i should have knownhe found what he was looking for in his inside pocket it seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter he flicked it open held it up in the air and clicked it the nearest street lamp went out with a little pop he clicked it again the next lamp flickered into darkness twelve times he clicked the putouter until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance which were the eyes of the cat watching him if anyone looked out of their window now even beadyeyed mrs dursley they wouldnt be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement dumbledore slipped the putouter back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four where he sat down on the wall next to the cat he didnt look at it but after a moment he spoke to itfancy seeing you here professor mcgonagallhe turned to smile at the tabby but it had gone instead he was smiling at a rather severelooking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes she too was wearing a cloak an emerald one her black hair was drawn into a tight bun she looked distinctly ruffledhow did you know it was me she askedmy dear professor i ve never seen a cat sit so stifflyyoud be stiff if youd been sitting on a brick wall all day said professor mcgonagallall day when you could have been celebrating i must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way hereprofessor mcgonagall sniffed angrilyoh yes everyones celebrating all right she said impatientlyyoud think theyd be a bit more careful but no even the muggles have noticed somethings going on it was on their news she jerked her head back at the dursleys dark livingroom window i heard it flocks of owls shooting stars well theyre not completely stupid they were bound to notice something shooting stars down in kent ill bet that was dedalus diggle he never had much senseyou cant blame them said dumbledore gently weve had precious little to celebrate for eleven yearsi know that said professor mcgonagall irritably but thats no reason to lose our heads people are being downright careless out on the streets in broad daylight not even dressed in muggle clothes swapping rumorsshe threw a sharp sideways glance at dumbledore here as though hoping he was going to tell her something but he didnt so she went on a fine thing it would be if on the very day youknowwho seems to have disappeared at last the muggles found out about us all i suppose he really has gone dumbledoreit certainly seems so said dumbledore we have much to be thankful for would you care for a lemon dropa whata lemon drop theyre a kind of muggle sweet im rather fond ofno thank you said professor mcgonagall coldly as though she didnt think this was the moment for lemon drops as i say even if youknowwho has gone my dear professor surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name all this you knowwho nonsense for eleven years i have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name voldemort professor mcgonagall flinched but dumbledore who was unsticking two lemon drops seemed not to notice it all gets so confusing if we keep saying youknowwho i have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying voldemorts namei know you haven t said professor mcgonagall sounding half exasperated half admiring but youre different everyone knows youre the only one youknow oh all right voldemort was frightened ofyou flatter me said dumbledore calmly voldemort had powers i will never haveonly because youre too well noble to use themits lucky its dark i havent blushed so much since madam pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffsprofessor mcgonagall shot a sharp look at dumbledore and said the owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around you know what everyones saying about why hes disappeared about what finally stopped himit seemed that professor mcgonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss the real reason she had been waiting on a cold hard wall all day for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now it was plain that whatever everyone was saying she was not going to believe it until dumbledore told her it was true dumbledore however was choosing another lemon drop and did not answerwhat theyre saying she pressed on is that last night voldemort turned up in godrics hollow he went to find the potters the rumor is that lily and james potter are are that theyre dead Ã¢â‚¬Å“dumbledore bowed his head professor mcgonagall gaspedlily and james i cant believe it i didnt want to believe itoh albusdumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder i know i know he said heavilyprofessor mcgonagalls voice trembled as she went on thats not alltheyre saying he tried to kill the potters son harry but he couldnt he couldnt kill that little boy no one knows why or how but theyre saying that when he couldnt kill harry potter voldemorts power somehow broke and thats why hes gonedumbledore nodded glumlyits its true faltered professor mcgonagall after all hes done all the people hes killed he couldnt kill a little boy its just astounding of all the things to stop him but how in the name of heaven did harry survivewe can only guess said dumbledore we may never knowprofessor mcgonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it it was a very odd watchit had twelve hands but no numbers instead little planets were moving around the edge it must have made sense to dumbledore though because he put it back in his pocket and said hagrids late i suppose it was he who told you id be here by the wayyes said professor mcgonagall and i dont suppose youre going to tell me why youre here of all placesive come to bring harry to his aunt and uncle theyre the only family he has left nowyou dont mean you cant mean the people who live here cried professor mcgonagall jumping to her feet and pointing at number fourdumbledore you cant ive been watching them all day you couldnt find two people who are less like us and theyve got this son i saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street screaming for sweetsharry potter come and live hereits the best place for him said dumbledore firmly his aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when hes older ive written them a lettera letter repeated professor mcgonagall faintly sitting back down on the wall really dumbledore you think you can explain all this in a letter these people will never understand him hell be famous a legend i wouldnt be surprised if today was known as harry potter day in the future there will be books written about harry every child in our world will know his nameexactly said dumbledore looking very seriously over the top of his halfmoon glasses it would be enough to turn any boys head famous before he can walk and talk famous for something he wont even remember cara you see how much better off hell be growing up away from all that until hes ready to take itprofessor mcgonagall opened her mouth changed her mind swallowed and then said yes yes youre right of course but how is the boy getting here dumbledore she eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding harry underneath ithagrids bringing himyou think it wise to trust hagrid with something as important as thisi would trust hagrid with my life said dumbledoreim not saying his heart isnt in the right place said professor mcgonagall grudgingly but you cant pretend hes not careless he does tend to what was thata low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them it grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of themif the motorcycle was huge it was nothing to the man sitting astride it he was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide he looked simply too big to be allowed and so wild long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face he had hands the size of trash can lids and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins in his vast muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blanketshagrid said dumbledore sounding relieved at last and where did you get that motorcycleborrowed it professor dumbledore sit said the giant climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke young sirius black lent it to me ive got him sirno problems were thereno sir house was almost destroyed but i got him out all right before the muggles started swarmin around he fell asleep as we was flyin over bristoldumbledore and professor mcgonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets inside just visible was a baby boy fast asleep under a tuft of jetblack hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut like a bolt of lightningis that where whispered professor mcgonagallyes said dumbledore hell have that scar forevercouldnt you do something about it dumbledoreeven if i could i wouldnt scars can come in handy i have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the london underground well give him here hagrid wed better get this over withdumbledore took harry in his arms and turned toward the dursleys housecould i could i say goodbye to him sir asked hagrid he bent his great shaggy head over harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy whiskery kiss then suddenly hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dogshhh hissed professor mcgonagall youll wake the mugglessssorry sobbed hagrid taking out a large spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it but i cccant stand it lily an james dead an poor little harry off ter live with muggles yes yes its all very sad but get a grip on yourself hagrid or well be found professor mcgonagall whispered patting hagrid gingerly on the arm as dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door he laid harry gently on the doorstep took a letter out of his cloak tucked it inside harrys blankets and then came back to the other two for a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle hagrids shoulders shook professor mcgonagall blinked furiously and the twinkling light that usually shone from dumbledores eyes seemed to have gone outwell said dumbledore finally thats that weve no business staying here we may as well go and join the celebrationsyeah said hagrid in a very muffled voice ill be takin sirius his bike back gnight professor mcgonagall professor dumbledore sirwiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life with a roar it rose into the air and off into the nighti shall see you soon i expect professor mcgonagall said dumbledore nodding to her professor mcgonagall blew her nose in replydumbledore turned and walked back down the street on the corner he stopped and took out the silver putouter he clicked it once and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that privet drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street he could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number fourgood luck harry he murmured he turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak he was gonea breeze ruffled the neat hedges of privet drive which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen harry potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up one small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on not knowing he was special not knowing he was famous not knowing he would be woken in a few hours time by mrs dursleys scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin dudley he couldnt know that at this very moment people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices to harry potter the boy who livedchapter twothe vanishing glassnearly ten years had passed since the dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step but privet drive had hardly changed at all the sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the dursleys front door it crept into their living room which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when mr dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passedten years ago there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing differentcolored bonnets but dudley dursley was no longer a baby and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle on a carousel at the fair playing a computer game with his father being hugged and kissed by his motherthe room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house tooyet harry potter was still there asleep at the moment but not for long his aunt petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the dayup get up nowharry woke with a start his aunt rapped on the door againup she screeched harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove he rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having it had been a good one there had been a flying motorcycle in it he had a funny feeling hed had the same dream beforehis aunt was back outside the doorare you up yet she demandednearly said harrywell get a move on i want you to look after the bacon and dont you dare let it burn i want everything perfect on duddys birthdayharry groanedwhat did you say his aunt snapped through the doornothing nothingdudleys birthday how could he have forgotten harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks he found a pair under his bed and after pulling a spider off one of them put them on harry was used to spiders because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them and that was where he sleptwhen he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen the table was almost hidden beneath all dudleys birthday presents it looked as though dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted not to mention the second television and the racing bike exactly why dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to harry as dudley was very fat and hated exercise unless of course it involved punching somebody dudleys favorite punching bag was harry but he couldnt often catch him harry didnt look it but he was very fastperhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard but harry had always been small and skinny for his age he looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of dudleys and dudley was about four times bigger than he was harry had a thin face knobbly knees black hair and bright green eyes he wore round glasses held together with a lot of scotch tape because of all the times dudley had punched him on the nose the only thing harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning he had had it as long as he could remember and the first question he could ever remember asking his aunt petunia was how he had gotten itin the car crash when your parents died she had said and dont ask questionsdont ask questions that was the first rule for a quiet life with the dursleysuncle vernon entered the kitchen as harry was turning over the baconcomb your hair he barked by way of a morning greetingabout once a week uncle vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that harry needed a haircut harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together but it made no difference his hair simply grew that way all over the placeharry was frying eggs by the time dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother dudley looked a lot like uncle vernon he had a large pink face not much neck small watery blue eyes and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick fat head aunt petunia often said that dudley looked like a baby angel harry often said that dudley looked like a pig in a wigharry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table which was difficult as there wasnt much room dudley meanwhile was counting his presentshis face fellthirtysix he said looking up at his mother and father thats two less than last yeardarling you havent counted auntie marges present see its here under this big one from mommy and daddyall right thirtyseven then said dudley going red in the faceharry who could see a huge dudley tantrum coming on began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case dudley turned the table overaunt petunia obviously scented danger too because she said quickly and well buy you another two presents while were out today hows that popkin two more presents is that all right dudley thought for a moment it looked like hard work finally he said slowly so ill have thirty thirtythirtynine sweetums said aunt petuniaoh dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel all right thenuncle vernon chuckled little tyke wants his moneys worth just like his father atta boy dudley he ruffled dudleys hairat that moment the telephone rang and aunt petunia went to answer it while harry and uncle vernon watched dudley unwrap the racing bike a video camera a remote control airplane sixteen new computer games and a vcr he was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when aunt petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worriedbad news vernon she said mrs figgs broken her leg she cant take him she jerked her head in harrys directiondudleys mouth fell open in horror but harrys heart gave a leap every year on dudleys birthday his parents took him and a friend out for the day to adventure parks hamburger restaurants or the movies every year harry was left behind with mrs figg a mad old lady who lived two streets away harry hated it there the whole house smelled of cabbage and mrs figg made him look at photographs of all the cats shed ever ownednow what said aunt petunia looking furiously at harry as though hed planned this harry knew he ought to feel sorry that mrs figg had broken her leg but it wasnt easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at tibbles snowy mr paws and tufty againwe could phone marge uncle vernon suggesteddont be silly vernon she hates the boythe dursleys often spoke about harry like this as though he wasnt there or rather as though he was something very nasty that couldnt understand them like a slugwhat about whatshername your friend yvonneon vacation in majorca snapped aunt petuniayou could just leave me here harry put in hopefully hed be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on dudleys computeraunt petunia looked as though shed just swallowed a lemonand come back and find the house in ruins she snarledi wont blow up the house said harry but they werent listeningi suppose we could take him to the zoo said aunt petunia slowly and leave him in the carthat cars new hes not sitting in it alonedudley began to cry loudly in fact he wasnt really crying it had been years since hed really cried but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed his mother would give him anything he wanteddinky duddydums dont cry mummy wont let him spoil your special day she cried flinging her arms around himi dont want him ttto come dudley yelled between huge pretend sobs he always sp spoils everything he shot harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mothers armsjust then the doorbell rang oh good lord theyre here said aunt petunia frantically and a moment later dudleys best friend piers polkiss walked in with his mother piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat he was usually the one who held peoples arms behind their backs while dudley hit them dudley stopped pretending to cry at oncehalf an hour later harry who couldnt believe his luck was sitting in the back of the dursleys car with piers and dudley on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life his aunt and uncle hadnt been able to think of anything else to do with him but before theyd left uncle vernon had taken harry asideim warning you he had said putting his large purple face right up close to harrys im warning you now boy any funny business anything at all and youll be in that cupboard from now until christmasim not going to do anything said harry honestlybut uncle vernon didnt believe him no one ever didthe problem was strange things often happened around harry and it was just no good telling the dursleys he didnt make them happenonce aunt petunia tired of harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadnt been at all had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs which she left to hide that horrible scar dudley had laughed himself silly at harry who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glassesnext morning however he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before aunt petunia had sheared it off he had been given a week in his cupboard for this even though he had tried to explain that he couldnt explain how it had grown back so quicklyanother time aunt petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of dudleys brown with orange puff balls the harder she tried to pull it over his head the smaller it seemed to become until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet but certainly wouldnt fit harry aunt petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and to his great relief harry wasnt punishedon the other hand hed gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens dudleys gang had been chasing him as usual when as much to harrys surprise as anyone elses there he was sitting on the chimney the dursleys had received a very angry letter from harrys headmistress telling them harry had been climbing school buildings but all hed tried to do as he shouted at uncle vernon through the locked door of his cupboard was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid jumpbut today nothing was going to go wrong it was even worth being with dudley and piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasnt school his cupboard or mrs figgs cabbagesmelling living roomwhile he drove uncle vernon complained to aunt petunia he liked to complain about things people at work harry the council harry the bank and harry were just a few of his favorite subjects this morning it was motorcyclesroaring along like maniacs the young hoodlums he said as a motorcycle overtook themi had a dream about a motorcycle said harry remembering suddenly it was flyinguncle vernon nearly crashed into the car in front he turned right around in his seat and yelled at harry his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache motorcycles dont flydudley and piers sniggeredi know they dont said harry it was only a dreambut he wished he hadnt said anything if there was one thing the dursleys hated even more than his asking questions it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldnt no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideasit was a very sunny saturday and the zoo was crowded with families the dursleys bought dudley and piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then because the smiling lady in the van had asked harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop it wasnt bad either harry thought licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like dudley except that it wasnt blondharry had the best morning hed had in a long time he was careful to walk a little way apart from the dursleys so that dudley and piers who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime wouldnt fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him they ate in the zoo restaurant and when dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didnt have enough ice cream on top uncle vernon bought him another one and harry was allowed to finish the firstharry felt afterward that he should have known it was all too good to lastafter lunch they went to the reptile house it was cool and dark in there with lit windows all along the walls behind the glass all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone dudley and piers wanted to see huge poisonous cobras and thick mancrushing pythons dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place it could have wrapped its body twice around uncle vernons car and crushed it into a trash can but at the moment it didnt look in the mood in fact it was fast asleepdudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass staring at the glistening brown coilsmake it move he whined at his father uncle vernon tapped on the glass but the snake didnt budgedo it again dudley ordered uncle vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles but the snake just snoozed onthis is boring dudley moaned he shuffled awayharry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake he wouldnt have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long it was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom where the only visitor was aunt petunia hammering on the door to wake you up at least he got to visit the rest of the housethe snake suddenly opened its beady eyes slowly very slowly it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with harrysit winkedharry stared then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching they werent he looked back at the snake and winked toothe snake jerked its head toward uncle vernon and dudley then raised its eyes to the ceiling it gave harry a look that said quite plainly i get that all the timei know harry murmured through the glass though he wasnt sure the snake could hear him it must be really annoyingthe snake nodded vigorouslywhere do you come from anyway harry askedthe snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass harry peered at itboa constrictor brazilwas it nice therethe boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and harry read on this specimen was bred in the zoo oh i see so youve never been to brazilas the snake shook its head a deafening shout behind harry made both of them jumpdudley mr dursley come and look at this snake you wont believe what its doingdudley came waddling toward them as fast as he couldout of the way you he said punching harry in the ribs caught by surprise harry fell hard on the concrete floor what came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened one second piers and dudley were leaning right up close to the glass the next they had leapt back with howls of horrorharry sat up and gasped the glass front of the boa constrictors tank had vanished the great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly slithering out onto the floor people throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exitsas the snake slid swiftly past him harry could have sworn a low hissing voice said brazil here i come thanksss amigothe keeper of the reptile house was in shockbut the glass he kept saying where did the glass gothe zoo director himself made aunt petunia a cup of strong sweet tea while he apologized over and over again piers and dudley could only gibber as far as harry had seen the snake hadnt done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed but by the time they were all back in uncle vernons car dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg while piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death but worst of all for harry at least was piers calming down enough to say harry was talking to it werent you harryuncle vernon waited until piers was safely out of the house before starting on harry he was so angry he could hardly speak he managed to say go cupboard stay no meals before he collapsed into a chair and aunt petunia had to run and get him a large brandyharry lay in his dark cupboard much later wishing he had a watch he didnt know what time it was and he couldnt be sure the dursleys were asleep yet until they were he couldnt risk sneaking to the kitchen for some foodhed lived with the dursleys almost ten years ten miserable years as long as he could remember ever since hed been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash he couldnt remember being in the car when his parents had died sometimes when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard he came up with a strange vision a blinding flash of green light and a burn ing pain on his forehead this he supposed was the crash though he couldnt imagine where all the green light came from he couldnt remember his parents at all his aunt and uncle never spoke about them and of course he was forbidden to ask questions there were no photographs of them in the housewhen he had been younger harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away but it had never happened the dursleys were his only family yet sometimes he thought or maybe hoped that strangers in the street seemed to know him very strange strangers they were too a tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with aunt petunia and dudley after asking harry furiously if he knew the man aunt petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything a wildlooking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus a bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word the weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second harry tried to get a closer lookat school harry had no one everybody knew that dudleys gang hated that odd harry potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses and nobody liked to disagree with dudleys gangchapter threethe letters from no onethe escape of the brazilian boa constrictor earned harry his longestever punishment by the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again the summer holidays had started and dudley had already broken his new video camera crashed his remote control airplane and first time out on his racing bike knocked down old mrs figg as she crossed privet drive on her crutchesharry was glad school was over but there was no escaping dudleys gang who visited the house every single day piers dennis malcolm and gordon were all big and stupid but as dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot he was the leader the rest of them were all quite happy to join in dudleys favorite sport harry huntingthis was why harry spent as much time as possible out of the house wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays where he could see a tiny ray of hope when september came he would be going off to secondary school and for the first time in his life he wouldnt be with dudley dudley had been accepted at uncle vernons old private school smeltings piers polkiss was going there too harry on the other hand was going to stonewall high the local public school dudley thought this was very funnythey stuff peoples heads down the toilet the first day at stonewallhe told harry want to come upstairs and practiceno thanks said harry the poor toilets never had anything as horrible as your head down it it might be sick then he ran before dudley could work out what hed saidone day in july aunt petunia took dudley to london to buy his smeltings uniform leaving harry at mrs figgs mrs figg wasn t as bad as usual it turned out shed broken her leg tripping over one of her cats and she didnt seem quite as fond of them as before she let harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though shed had it for several yearsthat evening dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brandnew uniform smeltings boys wore maroon tailcoats orange knickerbockers and flat straw hats called boaters they also carried knobbly sticks used for hitting each other while the teachers werent looking this was supposed to be good training for later lifeas he looked at dudley in his new knickerbockers uncle vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life aunt petunia burst into tears and said she couldnt believe it was her ickle dudleykins he looked so handsome and grownup harry didnt trust himself to speak he thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laughthere was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when harry went in for breakfast it seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink he went to have a look the tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray waterwhats this he asked aunt petunia her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a questionyour new school uniform she saidharry looked in the bowl againoh he said i didnt realize it had to be so wetdota be stupid snapped aunt petunia im dyeing some of dudleys old things gray for you itll look just like everyone elses when ive finishedharry seriously doubted this but thought it best not to argue he sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at stonewall high like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin probablydudley and uncle vernon came in both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from harrys new uniform uncle vernon opened his newspaper as usual and dudley banged his smelting stick which he carried everywhere on the tablethey heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormatget the mail dudley said uncle vernon from behind his papermake harry get itget the mail harrymake dudley get itpoke him with your smelting stick dudleyharry dodged the smelting stick and went to get the mail three things lay on the doormat a postcard from uncle vernons sister marge who was vacationing on the isle of wight a brown envelope that looked like a bill and a letter for harryharry picked it up and stared at it his heart twanging like a giant elastic band no one ever in his whole life had written to him who would he had no friends no other relatives he didnt belong to the library so hed never even got rude notes asking for books back yet here it was a letter addressed so plainly there could be no mistake mr h potter the cupboard under the stairs privet drive little whinging surrey the envelope was thick and heavy made of yellowish parchment and the address was written in emeraldgreen ink there was no stampturning the envelope over his hand trembling harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms a lion an eagle a badger and a snake surrounding a large letter hhurry up boy shouted uncle vernon from the kitchen what are you doing checking for letter bombs he chuckled at his own jokeharry went back to the kitchen still staring at his letter he handed uncle vernon the bill and the postcard sat down and slowly began to open the yellow envelopeuncle vernon ripped open the bill snorted in disgust and flipped over the postcardmarges ill he informed aunt petunia ate a funny whelk dad said dudley suddenly dad harrys got somethingharry was on the point of unfolding his letter which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by uncle vernonthats mine said harry trying to snatch it backwhod be writing to you sneered uncle vernon shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it his face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights and it didnt stop there within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridgepppetunia he gaspeddudley tried to grab the letter to read it but uncle vernon held it high out of his reach aunt petunia took it curiously and read the first line for a moment it looked as though she might faint she clutched her throat and made a choking noisevernon oh my goodness vernonthey stared at each other seeming to have forgotten that harry and dudley were still in the room dudley wasnt used to being ignored he gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his smelting sticki want to read that letter he said loudly want to read it said harry furiously as its mineget out both of you croaked uncle vernon stuffing the letter back inside its envelopeharry didnt movei want my letter he shoutedlet me see it demanded dudleyout roared uncle vernon and he took both harry and dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall slamming the kitchen door behind them harry and dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole dudley won so harry his glasses dangling from one ear lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floorvernon aunt petunia was saying in a quivering voice look at the address how could they possibly know where he sleeps you dont think theyre watching the housewatching spying might be following us muttered uncle vernon wildlybut what should we do vernon should we write back tell them we dont want harry could see uncle vernons shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchenno he said finally no well ignore it if they dont get an answer yes thats best we wont do anythingbut im not having one in the house petunia didnt we swear when we took him in wed stamp out that dangerous nonsensethat evening when he got back from work uncle vernon did something hed never done before he visited harry in his cupboardwheres my letter said harry the moment uncle vernon had squeezed through the door whos writing to meno one it was addressed to you by mistake said uncle vernon shortlyi have burned itit was not a mistake said harry angrily it had my cupboard on itsilence yelled uncle vernon and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling he took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile which looked quite painfuler yes harry about this cupboard your aunt and i have been thinking youre really getting a bit big for it we think it might be nice if you moved into dudleys second bedroomwhy said harrydont ask questions snapped his uncle take this stuff upstairs nowthe dursleys house had four bedrooms one for uncle vernon and aunt petunia one for visitors usually uncle vernons sister marge one where dudley slept and one where dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldnt fit into his first bedroom it only took harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room he sat down on the bed and stared around him nearly everything in here was broken the monthold video camera was lying on top of a small working tank dudley had once driven over the next door neighbors dog in the corner was dudleys firstever television set which hed put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled there was a large birdcage which had once held a parrot that dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because dudley had sat on it other shelves were full of books they were the only things in the room that looked as though theyd never been touchedfrom downstairs came the sound of dudley bawling at his mother i dont want him in there i need that room make him get outharry sighed and stretched out on the bed yesterday hed have given anything to be up here today hed rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without itnext morning at breakfast everyone was rather quiet dudley was in shock hed screamed whacked his father with his smelting stick been sick on purpose kicked his mother and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof and he still didnt have his room back harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing hed opened the letter in the hall uncle vernon and aunt petunia kept looking at each other darklywhen the mail arrived uncle vernon who seemed to be trying to be nice to harry made dudley go and get it they heard him banging things with his smelting stick all the way down the hall then he shouted theres another one mr h potter the smallest bedroom privet drive Ã¢â‚¬Å“with a strangled cry uncle vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall harry right behind him uncle vernon had to wrestle dudley to the ground to get the letter from him which was made difficult by the fact that harry had grabbed uncle vernon around the neck from behind after a minute of confused fighting in which everyone got hit a lot by the smelting stick uncle vernon straightened up gasping for breath with harrys letter clutched in his handgo to your cupboard i mean your bedroom he wheezed at harrydudley go just goharry walked round and round his new room someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadnt received his first letter surely that meant theyd try again and this time hed make sure they didnt fail he had a planthe repaired alarm clock rang at six oclock the next morning harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently he mustnt wake the dursleys he stole downstairs without turning on any of the lightshe was going to wait for the postman on the corner of privet drive and get the letters for number four first his heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door harry leapt into the air hed trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat something alive lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror harry realized that the big squashy something had been his uncles face uncle vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag clearly making sure that harry didnt do exactly what hed been trying to do he shouted at harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back the mail had arrived right into uncle vernons lapharry could see three letters addressed in green inki want he began but uncle vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes uncle vernon didnt go to work that day he stayed at home and nailed up the mail slotsee he explained to aunt petunia through a mouthful of nails if they cant deliver them theyll just give upim not sure thatll work vernonoh these peoples minds work in strange ways petunia theyre not like you and me said uncle vernon trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake aunt petunia had just brought himon friday no less than twelve letters arrived for harry as they couldnt go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door slotted through the sides and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroomuncle vernon stayed at home again after burning all the letters he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out he hummed tiptoe through the tulipsas he worked and jumped at small noiseson saturday things began to get out of hand twentyfour letters to harry found their way into the house rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed aunt petunia through the living room window while uncle vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to aunt petunia shredded the letters in her food processorwho on earth wants to talk to you this badly dudley asked harry in amazementon sunday morning uncle vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill but happyno post on sundays he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers no damn letters today something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head next moment thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets the dursleys ducked but harry leapt into the air trying to catch oneout outuncle vernon seized harry around the waist and threw him into the hallwhen aunt petunia and dudley had run out with their arms over their faces uncle vernon slammed the door shut they could hear the letters still streaming into the room bouncing off the walls and floorthat does it said uncle vernon trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time i want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave were going away just pack some clothes no argumentshe looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boardedup doors and were in the car speeding toward the highwaydudley was sniffling in the back seat his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television vcr and computer in his sports bagthey drove and they drove even aunt petunia didnt dare ask where they were going every now and then uncle vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while shakeem off shake em off he would mutter whenever he did thisthey didnt stop to eat or drink all day by nightfall dudley was howling hed never had such a bad day in his life he was hungry hed missed five television programs hed wanted to see and hed never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computeruncle vernon stopped at last outside a gloomylooking hotel on the outskirts of a big city dudley and harry shared a room with twin beds and damp musty sheets dudley snored but harry stayed awake sitting on the windowsill staring down at the lights of passing cars and wonderingthey ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day they had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their tablescuse me but is one of you mr h potter only i got about an undred of these at the front deskshe held up a letter so they could read the green ink address mr h potter room railview hotel cokeworth harry made a grab for the letter but uncle vernon knocked his hand out of the way the woman staredill take them said uncle vernon standing up quickly and following her from the dining roomwouldnt it be better just to go home dear aunt petunia suggested timidly hours later but uncle vernon didnt seem to hear her exactly what he was looking for none of them knew he drove them into the middle of a forest got out looked around shook his head got back in the car and off they went again the same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field halfway across a suspension bridge and at the top of a multilevel parking garagedaddys gone mad hasnt he dudley asked aunt petunia dully late that afternoon uncle vernon had parked at the coast locked them all inside the car and disappearedit started to rain great drops beat on the roof of the car dud ley sniveledits monday he told his mother the great humbertos on tonight i want to stay somewhere with a television Ã¢â‚¬Å“monday this reminded harry of something if it was monday and you could usually count on dudley to know the days the week because of television then tomorrow tuesday was harrys eleventh birthday of course his birthdays were never exactly fun last year the dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of uncle vernons old socksstill you werent eleven every dayuncle vernon was back and he was smiling he was also carrying a long thin package and didnt answer aunt petunia when she asked what hed boughtfound the perfect place he said come on everyone outit was very cold outside the car uncle vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine one thing was certain there was no television in therestorm forecast for tonight said uncle vernon gleefully clapping his hands together and this gentlemans kindly agreed to lend us his boata toothless old man came ambling up to them pointing with a rather wicked grin at an old rowboat bobbing in the irongray water below themive already got us some rations said uncle vernon so all aboardit was freezing in the boat icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces after what seemed like hours they reached the rock where uncle vernon slipping and sliding led the way to the brokendown housethe inside was horrible it smelled strongly of seaweed the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls and the fireplace was damp and empty there were only two roomsuncle vernons rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas he tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled upcould do with some of those letters now eh he said cheerfullyhe was in a very good mood obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail harry privately agreed though the thought didnt cheer him up at allas night fell the promised storm blew up around them spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows aunt petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for dudley on the motheaten sofa she and uncle vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door and harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest most ragged blanketthe storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on harry couldnt sleep he shivered and turned over trying to get comfortable his stomach rumbling with hunger dudleys snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight the lighted dial of dudleys watch which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist told harry hed be eleven in ten minutes time he lay and watched his birthday tick nearer wondering if the dursleys would remember at all wondering where the letter writer was nowfive minutes to go harry heard something creak outside he hoped the roof wasnt going to fall in although he might be warmer if it didfour minutes to go maybe the house in privet drive would be so full of letters when they got back that hed be able to steal one somehowthree minutes to go was that the sea slapping hard on the rock like that and two minutes to go what was that funny crunching noise was the rock crumbling into the sea one minute to go and hed be eleven thirty seconds twenty tennine maybe hed wake dudley up just to annoy him three twooneboomthe whole shack shivered and harry sat bolt upright staring at the door someone was outside knocking to come inchapter fourthe keeper of the keysboom they knocked again dudley jerked awake wheres the cannon he said stupidlythere was a crash behind them and uncle vernon came skidding into the room he was holding a rifle in his hands now they knew what had been in the long thin package he had brought with themwhos there he shouted i warn you im armedthere was a pause then Ã¢â‚¬â€œsmashthe door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floora giant of a man was standing in the doorway his face was almost completely hidden by a long shaggy mane of hair and a wild tangled beard but you could make out his eyes glinting like black beetles under all the hairthe giant squeezed his way into the hut stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling he bent down picked up the door and fitted it easily back into its frame the noise of the storm outside dropped a little he turned to look at them allcouldnt make us a cup o tea could yeh its not been an easy journeyhe strode over to the sofa where dudley sat frozen with fearbudge up yeh great lump said the strangerdudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother who was crouching terrified behind uncle vernonan heres harry said the giantharry looked up into the fierce wild shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smilelas time i saw you you was only a baby said the giant yeh look a lot like yet dad but yehve got yet moms eyesuncle vernon made a funny rasping noisei demand that you leave at once sit he said you are breaking and enteringah shut up dursley yeh great prune said the giant he reached over the back of the sofa jerked the gun out of uncle vernons hands bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber and threw it into a corner of the roomuncle vernon made another funny noise like a mouse being trodden onanyway harry said the giant turning his back on the dursleys a very happy birthday to yeh got summat fer yeh here i mighta sat on it at some point but itll taste all rightfrom an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed box harry opened it with trembling fingers inside was a large sticky chocolate cake with happy birthday harry written on it in green icingharry looked up at the giant he meant to say thank you but the words got lost on the way to his mouth and what he said instead was who are youthe giant chuckledtrue i havent introduced meself rubeus hagrid keeper of keys and grounds at hogwartshe held out an enormous hand and shook harrys whole armwhat about that tea then eh he said rubbing his hands togetherid not say no ter summat stronger if yehve got it mindhis eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he snorted he bent down over the fireplace they couldnt see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later there was a roaring fire there it filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and harry felt the warmth wash over him as though hed sunk into a hot baththe giant sat back down on the sofa which sagged under his weight and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat a copper kettle a squashy package of sausages a poker a teapot several chipped mugs and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage nobody said a thing while the giant was working but as he slid the first six fat juicy slightly burnt sausages from the poker dudley fidgeted a little uncle vernon said sharply dont touch anything he gives you dudleythe giant chuckled darklyyet great puddin of a son don need fattenin anymore dursley don worryhe passed the sausages to harry who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful but he still couldnt take his eyes off the giant finally as nobody seemed about to explain anything he said im sorry but i still dont really know who you arethe giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his handcall me hagrid he said everyone does an like i told yeh im keeper of keys at hogwarts yehll know all about hogwarts o courseer no said harryhagrid looked shockedsorry harry said quicklysony barked

after a few minutes he stammered what does it mean they await my owlgallopin gorgons that reminds me said hagrid clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl a real live rather ruffledlooking owl a long quill and a roll of parchmentwith his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that harry could read upside down dear professor dumbledore given harry his lettertaking him to buy his things tomorrowweathers horrible hope youre wellhagrid hagrid rolled up the note gave it to the owl which clamped it in its beak went to the door and threw the owl out into the storm then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephoneharry realized his mouth was open and closed

an james potter its an outrage a scandal harry potter not knowin his own story when every kid in our world knows his name but why what happened harry asked urgentlythe anger faded from hagrids face he

some o the best witches an wizards of the age the mckinnons the bones the prewetts an you was only a baby an you livedsomething very painful was going on in harrys mind as hagrids story came to a close he saw again the blinding flash of green light more clearly than he had ever remembered it before and he remembered something else for the first time in his life a high cold cruel laughhagrid was watching him sadlytook yeh from the ruined house myself on dumbledores orders brought yeh ter this lotload of old tosh said uncle vernon harry jumped he had almost forgotten that the dursleys were there uncle vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage he was glaring at hagrid and his fists were clenchednow you listen here boy he snarled i accept theres something strange about you probably nothing a good beating wouldnt have cured and as for all this about your parents well they were weirdos no denying it and the worlds better off without them in my opinion asked for all they got getting mixed up with these wizarding types just what i expected always knew theyd come to a sticky end but at that moment hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat pointing this at uncle vernon like a sword he said im warning you dursley im warning you one more word Ã¢â‚¬Å“in danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant uncle vernons courage failed again he flattened himself against the wall and fell silentthats better said hagrid breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa which this time sagged right down to the floorharry meanwhile still had questions to ask hundreds of thembut what happened to vol sorry i mean youknowwhogood question harry disappeared vanished same night he tried ter kill you makes yeh even more famous thats the biggest mystry seehe was gettin more an more powerful whyd he go some say he died codswallop in my opinion dunno if he had enough human left in him to die some say hes still out there bidin his time like but i don believe it people who was on his side came back ter ours some of em came outta kinda trances don reckon they couldve done if he was comin backmost of us reckon hes still out there somewhere but lost his powerstoo weak to carry on cause somethin about you finished him harrythere was somethin goin on that night he hadnt counted on i dunno what it was no one does but somethin about you stumped him all righthagrid looked at harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes but harry instead of feeling pleased and proud felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake a wizard him how could he possibly be hed spent his life being clouted by dudley and bullied by aunt petunia and uncle vernon if he was really a wizard why hadnt they been turned into warty toads every time theyd tried to lock him in his cupboard if hed once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world how come dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football hagrid he said quietly i think you must have made a mistake i dont think i can be a wizardto his surprise hagrid chucklednot a wizard eh never made things happen when you was scared or angryharry looked into the fire now he came to think about it every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he harry had been upset or angry chased by dudleys gang he had somehow found himself out of their reach dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut hed managed to make it grow back and the very last time dudley had hit him hadnt he got his revenge without even realizing he was doing it hadnt he set a boa constrictor on him harry looked back at hagrid smiling and saw that hagrid was positively beaming at himsee said hagrid harry potter not a wizard you wait youll be right famous at hogwartsbut uncle vernon wasnt going to give in without a fighthavent i told you hes not going he hissed hes going to stonewall high and hell be grateful for it ive read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish spell books and wands and if he wants ter go a great muggle like you wont stop him growled hagrid stop lily an james potter s son goin ter hogwarts yer madhis

change an hell be under the greatest headmaster hogwarts ever had albus dumbledi am not paying for some crackpot old fool to teach him magic tricksyelled uncle vernonbut he had finally gone too far hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it over his head never he thundered insult albus dumbledorein front of mehe brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at dudley there was a flash of violet light a sound like a firecracker a sharp squeal and the next second dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom howling in pain when he turned his back on them harry saw a curly pigs tail poking through a hole in his trousersuncle vernon roared pulling aunt petunia and dudley into the other room he cast one last terrified look at hagrid and slammed the door behind themhagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beardshouldnta lost me temper he said ruefully but it didnt work anyway meant ter turn him into a pig but i suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there wasnt much left ter dohe cast a sideways look at harry under his bushy eyebrowsbe grateful if yeh didnt mention that ter anyone at hogwarts he said im er not supposed ter do

right harry mumbled im getting uphe sat up and hagrids heavy coat fell off him the hut was full of sunlight the storm was over hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window a newspaper held in its beakharry scrambled to his feet so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him he went straight to the window and jerked it open the owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of hagrid who didnt wake up the owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack hagrids coatdont do thatharry tried to wave the owl out of the way but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coathagrid said harry loudly theres an owl pay him hagrid grunted into the sofawhathe wants payin fer deliverin the paper look in the pocketshagrids coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets bunches of keys slug pellets balls of string peppermint humbugs teabagsfinally harry pulled out a handful of strangelooking coinsgive him five knuts said hagrid sleepilyknutsthe little bronze onesharry counted out five little bronze coins and the owl held out his leg so harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it then he flew off through the open windowhagrid yawned loudly sat up and stretchedbest be off harry lots ter do today gotta get up ter london an buy all yer stuff fer schoolharry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them he had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had got a punctureum hagridmm said hagrid who was pulling on his huge bootsi havent got any money and you heard uncle vernon last night he wont pay for me to go and learn magicdont worry about that said hagrid standing up and scratching his head dyeh think yer

thenharry followed hagrid out onto the rock the sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight the boat uncle vernon had hired was still there with a lot of water in the bottom after the stormhow did you get here harry asked looking around for another boatflew said hagridflewyeah but well go back in this not spposed ter use magic now ive got yehthey settled down in the boat harry still staring at hagrid trying to imagine him flyingseems a shame ter row though said hagrid giving harry another of his sideways looks if i was ter er speed things up a bit would yeh mind not mentionin it at hogwartsof course not said harry eager to see more magic hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again tapped it twice on the side of the boat and they sped off toward landwhy would you be

gringotts is hundreds of miles under london see deep under the underground yehd die of hunger tryin ter get out even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summatharry sat and thought about this while hagrid read his newspaper the daily prophet harry had learned from uncle vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this but it was very difficult hed never had so many questions in his lifeministry o magic messin things up as usual hagrid muttered turning the pagetheres a ministry of magic harry asked before he could stop himselfcourse said hagrid they wanted dumbledore fer minister course but hed never leave hogwarts so old cornelius fudge got the job bungler if ever there was one so he pelts dumbledore with owls every morning askin fer advicebut what does a ministry of magic dowell their main job is to keep it from the muggles that theres still witches an wizards up an down the countrywhywhy blimey harry everyoned be wantin magic solutions to their problems nah were best left aloneat this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall hagrid folded up his newspaper and they clambered up the stone steps onto the streetpassersby stared a lot at hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station harry couldnt blame them not only was hagrid twice as tall as anyone else he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly see that harry things these muggles dream up ehhagrid said harry panting a bit as he ran to keep up did you say there are dragons at gringottswell so they say said hagrid crikey id like a dragonyoud like onewanted one ever since i was a kid here we gothey had reached the station there was a train to london in five minutes time hagrid who didnt understand muggle money as he called it gave the bills to harry so he could buy their ticketspeople stared more than ever on the train hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canaryyellow circus tentstill got yer letter harry he asked as he counted stitches harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocketgood said hagrid theres a list there of everything yeh needharry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadnt noticed the night before and read hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry uniform firstyear students will require three sets of plain work robes black one plain pointed hat black for day wear one pair of protective

years are not allowed their own broomsticks can we buy all this in london harry wondered aloudif yeh know where to go said hagridharry had never been to london before although hagrid seemed to know where he was going he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way he got stuck in the ticket barrier on the underground and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slowi dont know how the muggles manage without magic he said as they climbed a brokendown escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shopshagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily all harry had to do was keep close behind him they passed book shops and music stores hamburger restaurants and cinemas but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand this was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks might this not all be some huge joke that the dursleys had cooked up if harry hadnt known that the dursleys had no sense of humor he might have thought so yet somehow even though everything hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable harry couldnt help trusting himthis is it said hagrid coming to a halt the leaky cauldron its a famous placeit was a tiny grubbylooking pub if hagrid hadnt pointed it out harry wouldnt have noticed it was there the people hurrying by didnt glance at it their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldnt see the leaky cauldron at all in fact harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and hagrid could see it before he could mention this hagrid had steered him insidefor a famous place it was very dark and shabby a few old women were sitting in a corner drinking tiny glasses of sherry one of them was smoking a long pipe a little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut the low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in everyone seemed to know hagrid they waved and smiled at him and the bartender reached for a glass saying the usual hagridcant tom im on hogwarts business said hagrid clapping his great hand on harrys shoulder and making harrys knees bucklegood lord said the bartender peering at harry is this can this be the leaky cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silentbless my soul whispered the old bartender harry potter what an honorhe hurried out from behind the bar rushed toward harry and seized his hand tears in his eyeswelcome back mr potter welcome backharry didnt know what to say everyone was looking at him the old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone outhagrid was beamingthen there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the leaky cauldrondoris crockford mr potter cant believe im meeting you at lastso proud mr potter im just so proudalways wanted to shake your hand im all of a flutterdelighted mr potter just cant tell you diggles the name dedalus diggleive seen you before said harry as dedalus diggles top

crockford kept coming back for morea pale young man made his way forward very nervously one of his eyes was twitchingprofessor quirrell said hagrid harry professor quirrell will be one of your teachers at hogwartspppotter stammered professor quirrell grasping harrys hand ccant ttell you how p pleased i am to meet youwhat sort of magic do you teach professor quirrellddefense against the

last hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babblemust get on lots ter buy come on harrydoris crockford shook harrys hand one last time and hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small walled courtyard where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weedshagrid grinned at harrytold yeh didnt i told yeh you was famous even professor quirrell was tremblin ter meet yeh mind you hes usually tremblinis he always that nervousoh yeah poor bloke brilliant mind he was fine while he was studyin outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience they say he met vampires in the black forest and there was a nasty bit o trouble with a hag never been the same sincescared of the students scared of his own subject now wheres me umbrellavampires hags harrys head was swimming hagrid meanwhile was counting bricks in the wall above the trash canthree up two across he muttered right stand back harryhe tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrellathe brick he had touched quivered it wriggled in the middle a small hole appeared it grew wider and wider a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for hagrid an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sightwelcome said hagrid to diagon alleyhe grinned at harrys amazement they stepped through the archway harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wallthe sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shopcauldrons all sizes copper brass pewter silver selfstirring collapsible said a sign hanging over themyeah youll be needin one said hagrid but we gotta get yer money firstharry wished he had about eight more eyes he turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street trying to look at everything at once the shops the things outside them the people doing their shopping a plump woman outside an apothecary was shaking her head as they passed saying dragon liver seventeen sickles an ounce theyre mada low soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying eeylops owl emporium tawny screech barn brown and snowy several boys of about harrys age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it look harry heard one of them say the new nimbus two thousand fastest ever there were shops selling robes shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments harry had never seen before windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels eyes tottering piles of spell books quills and rolls of parchment potion bottles globes of the moongringotts said hagridthey had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops standing beside its burnished bronze doors wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold was yeah thats a goblin said hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him the goblin was about a head shorter than harryhe had a swarthy clever face a pointed beard and harry noticed very long fingers and feet he bowed as they walked inside now they were facing a second pair of doors silver this time with words engraved upon them enter stranger but take heed of what awaits the sin of greed for those who take but do not earn must pay most dearly in their turnso if you seek beneath our floors a treasure that was never yours thief you have been warned beware of finding more than treasure therelike i said yehd be mad ter try an rob it said hagrida pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall about a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter scribbling in large ledgers weighing coins in brass scales examining precious stones through eyeglassesthere were too many doors to count leading off the hall and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these hagrid and harry made for the countermorning said hagrid to a free goblin weve come ter take some money outta mr harry potters safeyou have his key sirgot it here somewhere said hagrid and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblins book of numbers the goblin wrinkled his nose harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coalsgot it said hagrid at last holding up a tiny golden keythe goblin looked at it closelythat seems to be in orderan ive also got a letter here from professor dumbledore said hagrid importantly throwing out his chest its about the youknowwhat in vault seven hundred and thirteenthe goblin read the letter carefullyvery well he said handing it back to hagrid i will have someone take you down to both vaults griphookgriphook was yet another goblin once hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets he and harry followed griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hallwhats the youknowwhat in vault seven hundred and thirteen harry askedcant tell yeh that said hagrid mysteriously very secret hogwarts business dumbledores trusted me moren my jobs worth ter tell yeh thatgriphook held the door open for them harry who had expected more marble was surprised they were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches it sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them they climbed in hagrid with some difficulty and were offat first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages harry tried to remember left right right left middle fork right left but it was impossible the rattling cart seemed to know its own way because griphook wasnt steeringharrys eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them but he kept them wide open once he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon but too late they plunged even deeper passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floori never know harry called to hagrid over the noise of the cart whats the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactitestalagmites got an m in it said hagrid an don ask me questions just now i think im gonna be sickhe did look very green and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from tremblinggriphook unlocked the door a lot of green smoke came billowing out and as it cleared harry gasped inside were mounds of gold coins columns of silver heaps of little bronze knutsall yours smiled hagridall harrys it was incredible the dursleys couldnt have known about this or theyd have had it from him faster than blinking how often had they complained how much harry cost them to keep and all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him buried deep under londonhagrid helped harry pile some of it into a bagthe gold ones are galleons he explained seventeen silver sickles to a galleon and twentynine knuts to a sickle its easy enough right that should be enough fer a couple o terms well keep the rest safe for yeh he turned to griphook vault seven hundred and thirteen now please and can we go more slowlyone speed only said griphookthey were going even deeper now and gathering speed the air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners they went rattling over an underground ravine and harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom but hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neckvault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyholestand back said griphook importantly he stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted awayif anyone but a gringotts goblin tried that theyd be sucked through the door and trapped in there said griphookhow often do you check to see if anyones inside harry askedabout once every ten years said griphook with a rather nasty grinsomething really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault harry was sure and he leaned forward eagerly expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least but at first he thought it was empty then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat harry longed to know what it was but knew better than to askcome on back in this infernal cart and dont talk to me on the way back its best if i keep me mouth shut said hagridone wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside gringotts harry didnt know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money he didnt have to know how many galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than hed had in his whole life more money than even dudley had ever hadmight as well get yer uniform said hagrid nodding toward madam malkins robes for all occasions listen harry would yeh mind if i slipped off fer a pickmeup in the leaky cauldron i hate them gringotts carts he did still look a bit sick so harry entered madam malkins shop alone feeling nervousmadam malkin was a squat smiling witch dressed all in mauvehogwarts clear she said when harry started to speak got the lot here another young man being fitted up just now in fact Ã¢â‚¬Å“in the back of the shop a boy with a pale pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes madam malkin stood harry on a stool next to him slipped a long robe over his head and began to pin it to the right lengthhello said the boy hogwarts tooyes said harrymy fathers next door buying my books and mothers up the street looking at wands said the boy he had a bored drawling voice then im going to drag them off to took at racing brooms i dont see why first years cant have their own i think ill bully father into getting me one and ill smuggle it in somehowharry was strongly reminded of dudleyhave you got your own broom the boy went onno said harryplay quidditch at allno harry said again wondering what on earth quidditch could bei do father says its a crime if im not picked to play for my house and i must say i agree know what house youll be in yetno said harry feeling more stupid by the minutewell no one really knows until they get there do they but i know ill be in slytherin all our family have been imagine being in hufflepuff i think id leave wouldnt you mmm said harry wishing he could say something a bit more interestingi say look at that man said the boy suddenly nodding toward the front window hagrid was standing there grinning at harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldnt come inthats hagrid said harry pleased to know something the boy didnthe works at hogwartsoh said the boy ive heard of him hes a sort of servant isnt hehes the gamekeeper said harry he was liking the boy less and less every secondyes exactly i heard hes a sort of savage lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk tries to do magic and ends up setting fire to his bedi think hes brilliant said harry coldlydo you said the boy with a slight sneer why is he with you where are your parentstheyre dead said harry shortly he didnt feel much like going into the matter with this boyoh sorry said the other not sounding sorry at all but they were our kind werent theythey were a witch and wizard if thats what you meani really dont think they should let the other sort in do you theyre just not the same theyve never been brought up to know our ways some of them have never even heard of hogwarts until they get the letter imagine i think they should keep it in the old wizarding familieswhats your surname anywaybut before harry could answer madam malkin said thats you done my dear and harry not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy hopped down from the footstoolwell ill see you at hogwarts i suppose said the drawling boyharry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream hagrid had bought him chocolate and raspberry with chopped nutswhats up said hagridnothing harry lied they stopped to buy parchment and quills harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote when they had left the shop he said hagrid whats quidditchblimey harry i keep forgettin how little yeh know not knowin about quidditchdont make me feel worse said harry he told hagrid about the pate boy in madam malkinsand he said people from muggle families shouldnt even be allowed inyer not from a muggle family if hed known who yeh were hes grown up knowin yer name if his parents are wizardin folk you saw what everyone in the leaky cauldron was like when they saw yeh anyway what does he know about it some o the best i ever saw were the only ones with magic in em in a long line muggles look at yer mum look what she had fer a sisterso what is quidditchits our sport wizard sport its like like soccer in the muggle world everyone follows quidditch played up in the air on broomsticks and theres four balls sorta hard ter explain the rulesand what are slytherin and hufflepuffschool houses theres four everyone says hufflepuff are a lot o duffers but i bet im in hufflepuff said harry gloomilybetter hufflepuff than slytherin said hagrid darkly theres not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasnt in slytherinyouknowwho was onevol sorry youknowwho was at hogwartsyears an years ago said hagridthey bought harrys school books in a shop called flourish and blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all even dudley who never read anything would have been wild to get his hands on some of these hagrid almost had to drag harry away from curses and countercurses bewitch your friends and befuddle your enemies with the latest revenges hair loss jellylegs tongue tying and much much more by professor vindictus viridiani was trying to find out how to curse dudleyim not sayin thats not a good idea but yer not ter use magic in the muggle world except in very special circumstances said hagrid an anyway yeh couldn work any of them curses yet yehll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that levelhagrid wouldnt let harry buy a solid gold cauldron either it says pewter on yer list but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope then they visited the apothecary which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor jars of herbs dried roots and bright powders lined the walls bundles of feathers strings of fangs and snarled claws hung from the ceiling while hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for harry harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twentyone galleons each and minuscule glitteryblack beetle eyes five knuts a scoopoutside the apothecary hagrid checked harrys list againjust yer wand left a yeah an i still havent got yeh a birthday presentharry felt himself go redyou dont have to i know i dont have to tell yeh what ill get yer animal not a toad toads went outta fashion years ago yehd be laughed at an i don like cats they make me sneeze ill get yer an owl all the kids want owls theyre dead useful carry yer mail an everythintwenty minutes later they left eeylops owl emporium which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering jewelbright eyes harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl fast asleep with her head under her wing he couldnt stop stammering his thanks sounding just like professor quirrelldon mention it said hagrid gruffly don expect youve had a lotta presents from them dursleys just ollivanders left now only place fer wands ollivanders and yeh gotta have the best wanda magic wand this was what harry had been really looking forward tothe last shop was narrow and shabby peeling gold letters over the door read ollivanders makers of fine wands since bc a single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty windowa tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside it was a tiny place empty except for a single spindly chair that hagrid sat on to wait harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling for some reason the back of his neck prickled the very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magicgood afternoon said a soft voice harry jumped hagrid must have jumped too because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chairan old man was standing before them his wide pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shophello said harry awkwardlyah yes said the man yes yes i thought id be seeing you soonharry potter it wasnt a question you have your mothers eyes it seems only yesterday she was in here herself buying her first wand ten and a quarter inches long swishy made of willow nice wand for charm workmr ollivander moved closer to harry harry wished he would blink those silvery eyes were a bit creepyyour father on the other hand favored a mahogany wand eleven inchespliable a little more power and excellent for transfiguration well i say your father favored it its really the wand that chooses the wizard of coursemr ollivander had come so close that he and harry were almost nose to nose harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyesand thats wheremr ollivander touched the lightning scar on harrys forehead with a long white fingerim sorry to say i sold the wand that did it he said softlythirteenandahalf inches yew powerful wand very powerful and in the wrong hands well if id known what that wand was going out into the world to dohe shook his head and then to harrys relief spotted hagridrubeus rubeus hagrid how nice to see you again oak sixteen inches rather bendy wasnt itit was sir yes said hagridgood wand that one but i suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled said mr ollivander suddenly sterner yes they did yes said hagrid shuffling his feet ive still got the pieces though he added brightlybut you dont use them said mr ollivander sharplyoh no sit said hagrid quickly harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spokehmmm said mr ollivander giving hagrid a piercing look well now mr potter let me see he pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket which is your wand armer well im righthanded said harryhold out your arm thats it he measured harry from shoulder to finger then wrist to elbow shoulder to floor knee to armpit and round his head as he measured he said every ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance mr potter we use unicorn hairs phoenix tail feathers and the heartstrings of dragons no two ollivander wands are the same just as no two unicorns dragons or phoenixes are quite the same and of course you will never get such good results with another wizards wandharry suddenly realized that the tape measure which was measuring between his nostrils was doing this on its own mr ollivander was flitting around the shelves taking down boxesthat will do he said and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor right then mr potter try this one beechwood and dragon heartstring nine inches nice and flexible just take it and give it a waveharry took the wand and feeling foolish waved it around a bit but mr ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at oncemaple and phoenix feather

inches nice and suppleharry took the wand he felt a sudden warmth in his fingers he raised the wand above his head brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls hagrid whooped and clapped and mr ollivander cried oh bravo yes indeed oh very good well well well how curious how very curious Ã¢â‚¬Å“he put harrys wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper still muttering curious curioussorry said harry but whats curiousmr ollivander fixed harry with his pale starei

remember i think we must expect great things from you mr potter after all he whomustnotbenamed did great things terrible yes but greatharry shivered he wasnt sure he liked mr ollivander too much he paid seven gold galleons for his wand and mr ollivander bowed them from his shopthe late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as harry and hagrid made their way back down diagon alley back through the wall back through the leaky cauldron now empty harry didnt speak at all as they walked down the road he didnt even notice how much people were gawking at them on the underground laden as they were with all their funnyshaped packages with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on harrys lap up another escalator out into paddington station harry only realized where they were when hagrid tapped him on the shouldergot time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves he saidhe bought harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them harry kept looking around everything looked so strange somehowyou all right harry yer very quiet said hagridharry wasnt sure he could explain hed just had the best birthday of his life and yet he chewed his hamburger trying to find the wordseveryone

cant even remember what im famous for i dont know what happened when vol sorry i mean the night my parents diedhagrid leaned across the table behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smiledon you worry harry youll learn fast enough everyone starts at the beginning at hogwarts youll be just fine just be yerself i know its hard yehve been singled out an thats always hard but yehll have a great time at hogwarts i did still do smatter of facthagrid helped harry on to the train that would take him back to the dursleys then handed him an envelopeyer ticket fer hogwarts he said first o september kings cross its all on yer ticket any problems with the dursleys send me a letter with yer owl shell know where to find me see yeh soon harrythe train pulled out of the station harry wanted to watch hagrid until he was out of sight he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window but he blinked and hagrid had gonechapter sixthe journey from platform nine and threequartersharrys last month with the dursleys wasnt fun true dudley was now so scared of harry he wouldnt stay in the same room while aunt petunia and uncle vernon didnt shut harry in his cupboard force him to do anything or shout at him in fact they didnt speak to him at allhalf terrified half furious they acted as though any chair with harry in it were empty although this was an improvement in many ways it did become a bit depressing after a whileharry kept to his room with his new owl for company he had decided to call her hedwig a name he had found in a history of magic his school books were very interesting he lay on his bed reading late into the night hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased it was lucky that aunt petunia didnt come in to vacuum anymore because hedwig kept bringing back dead mice every night before he went to sleep harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall counting down to september the firston the last day of august he thought hed better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to kings cross station the next day so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television he cleared his throat to let them know he was there and dudley screamed and ran from the roomer uncle vernonuncle vernon grunted to show he was listeninger i need to be at kings cross tomorrow to to go to hogwartsuncle vernon grunted againwould it be all right if you gave me a liftgrunt harry supposed that meant yesthank youhe was about to go back upstairs when uncle vernon actually spokefunny way to get to a wizards school the train magic carpets all got punctures have theyharry didnt say anythingwhere is this school anywayi dont know said harry realizing this for the first time he pulled the ticket hagrid had given him out of his pocketi just take the train from platform nine and threequarters at eleven oclock he readhis aunt and uncle staredplatform whatnine and threequartersdont talk rubbish said uncle vernon there is no platform nine and threequartersits on my ticketbarking said uncle vernon howling mad the lot of them youll seeyou just wait all right well take you to kings cross were going up to london tomorrow anyway or i wouldnt botherwhy are you going to london harry asked trying to keep things friendlytaking dudley to the hospital growled uncle vernon got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to smeltingsharry woke at five oclock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep he got up and pulled on his jeans because he didnt want to walk into the station in his wizards robes hed change on the train he checked his hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed saw that hedwig was shut safely in her cage and then paced the room waiting for the dursleys to get up two hours later harrys huge heavy trunk had been loaded into the dursleys car aunt petunia had talked dudley into sitting next to harry and they had set offthey reached kings cross at half past ten uncle vernon dumped harrys trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him harry thought this was strangely kind until uncle vernon stopped dead facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his facewell there you are boy platform nine platform ten your platform should be somewhere in the middle but they dont seem to have built it yet do theyhe was quite right of course there was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it and in the middle nothing at allhave a good term said uncle vernon with an even nastier smile he left without another word harry turned and saw the dursleys drive awayall three of them were laughing harrys mouth went rather dry what on earth was he going to do he was starting to attract a lot of funny looks because of hedwig hed have to ask someonehe stopped a passing guard but didnt dare mention platform nine and threequarters the guard had never heard of hogwarts and when harry couldnt even tell him what part of the country it was in he started to get annoyed as though harry was being stupid on purpose getting desperate harry asked for the train that left at eleven oclock but the guard said there wasnt one in the end the guard strode away muttering about time wasters harry was now trying hard not to panicaccording to the large clock over the arrivals board he had ten minutes left to get on the train to hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift a pocket full of wizard money and a large owlhagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do like tapping the third brick on the left to get into diagon alley he wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspectors stand between platforms nine and tenat that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were sayingpacked with muggles of course harry swung round the speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys all with flaming red hair each of them was pushing a trunk like harrys in front of him and they had an owlheart hammering harry pushed his cart after them they stopped and so did he just near enough to hear what they were sayingnow whats the platform number said the boys mothernine and threequarters piped a small girl also redheaded who was holding her hand mom cant i go Ã¢â‚¬Å“youre not old enough ginny now be quiet all right percy you go firstwhat looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and tenharry watched careful not to blink in case he missed it but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away the boy had vanishedfred you next the plump woman saidim not fred im george said the boy honestly woman you call yourself our mother cara you tell im georgesorry george dearonly joking i am fred said the boy and off he went his twin called after him to hurry up and he must have done so because a second later he had gone but how had he done it now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was almost there and then quite suddenly he wasnt anywherethere was nothing else for itexcuse me harry said to the plump womanhello dear she said first time at hogwarts rons new tooshe pointed at the last and youngest of her sons he was tall thin and gangling with freckles big hands and feet and a long noseyes said harry the thing is the thing is i dont know how to how to get onto the platform she said kindly and harry noddednot to worry she said all you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten dont stop and dont be scared youll crash into it thats very important best do it at a bit of a run if youre nervous go on go now before roner okay said harryhe pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier it looked very solidhe started to walk toward it people jostled him on their way to platforms nine and ten harry walked more quickly he was going to smash right into that barrier and then hed be in trouble leaning forward on his cart he broke into a heavy run the barrier was coming nearer and nearer he wouldnt be able to stop the cart was out of control he was a foot away he closed his eyes ready for the crash it didnt come he kept on running he opened his eyes a scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people a sign overhead said hogwarts express eleven oclock harry looked behind him and saw a wroughtiron archway where the barrier had been with the words platform nine and threequarters on it he had done itsmoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunksthe first few carriages were already packed with students some hanging out of the window to talk to their families some fighting over seatsharry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seathe passed a roundfaced boy who was saying gran ive lost my toad againoh neville he heard the old woman sigha boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowdgive us a look lee go onthe boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long hairy legharry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train he put hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door he tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his footwant a hand it was one of the redhaired twins hed followed through the barrieryes please harry pantedoy fred cmere and helpwith the twins

saw the boys mother waving and their sister half laughing half crying running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed then she fell back and wavedharry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner houses flashed past the window harry felt a great leap of excitement he didnt know what he was going to but it had to be better than what he was leaving behindthe door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came inanyone sitting there he asked pointing at the seat opposite harryeverywhere else is fullharry shook his head and the boy sat down he glanced at harry and then looked quickly out of the window pretending he hadnt looked harry saw he still had a black mark on his nosehey ronthe twins were backlisten were going

doing he looked quickly out of the window againare all your family wizards asked harry who found ron just as interesting as ron found himer yes i think so said ron i think moms got a second cousin whos an accountant but we never talk about himso you must know loads of magic alreadythe weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in diagon alley had talked abouti heard

rat which was asleephis names scabbers and hes useless he hardly ever wakes up percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect but they couldnt aff i mean i got scabbers insteadrons ears went pink he seemed to think hed said too much because he went back to staring out of the windowharry didnt think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl after all hed never had any money in his life until a month ago and he told ron so all about having to wear dudleys old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents this seemed to cheer ron upand until hagrid told me i didnt know anything about be ing a wizard or about my parents or voldemortron gaspedwhat said harryyou said youknowwhos name said ron sounding both shocked and impressed id have thought you of all people im not trying to be brave or anything saying the name said harry i just never knew you shouldnt see what i mean ive got loads to learn i bet he added voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot lately i bet im the worst in the classyou wont be theres loads of people who come from muggle families and they learn quick enoughwhile they had been talking the train had carried them out of londonnow they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep they were quiet for a time watching the fields and lanes flick pastaround half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling dimpled woman slid back their door and said anything off the cart dearsharry who hadnt had any breakfast leapt to his feet but rons ears went pink again and he muttered that hed brought sandwiches harry went out into the corridorhe had never had any money for candy with the dursleys and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many mars bars as he could carry but the woman didnt have mars bars what she did have were bettie botts every flavor beans droobles best blowing gum chocolate frogs pumpkin pasties cauldron cakes licorice wands and a number of other strange things harry had never seen in his life not wanting to miss anything he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver sickles and seven bronze knutsron stared as harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seathungry are youstarving said harry taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pastyron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it there were four sandwiches inside he pulled one of them apart and said she always forgets i dont like corned beefswap you for one of these said harry holding up a pasty go on you dont want this its all dry said ron she hasnt got much time he added quickly you know with five of usgo on have a pasty said harry who had never had anything to share before or indeed anyone to share it with it was a nice feeling sitting there with ron eating their way through all harrys pasties cakes and candies the sandwiches lay forgottenwhat are these harry asked ron holding up a pack of chocolate frogstheyre not really frogs are they he was starting to feel that nothing would surprise himno said ron but see what the card is im missing agrippawhatoh of course you wouldnt know chocolate frogs have cards inside them you know to collect famous witches and wizards ive got about five hundred but i havent got agrippa or ptolemyharry unwrapped his chocolate frog and picked up the card it showed a mans face he wore half moon glasses had a long crooked nose and flowing silver hair beard and mustache underneath the picture was the name albus dumbledoreso this is dumbledore said harrydont tell me youd never heard of dumbledore said ron can i have a frog i might get agrippa thanks harry turned over his card and read albus dumbledore currently headmaster of hogwarts considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard grindelwald in for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragons blood and his work on alchemy with his partner nicolas flamel professor dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowlingharry turned the card back over and saw to his astonishment that dumbledores face had disappearedhes gonewell you cant expect him to hang around all day said ron hell be back no ive got morgana again and ive got about six of her do you want it you can start collectingrons eyes strayed to the pile of chocolate frogs waiting to be unwrappedhelp yourself said harry but in you know the muggle world people just stay put in photosdo they what they dont move at all ron sounded amazed weirdharry stared as dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the famous witches and wizards cards but harry couldnt keep his eyes off them soon he had not only dumbledore and morgana but hengist of woodcroft alberic grunnion circe paracelsus and merlinhe finally tore his eyes away from the druidess cliodna who was scratching her nose to open a bag of bertie botts every flavor beansyou want to be careful with those ron warned harry when they say every flavor they mean every flavor you know you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and mar malade but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe george reckons he had a boogerflavored one onceron picked up a green bean looked at it carefully and bit into a cornerbleaaargh see sproutsthey had a good time eating the every flavor beans harry got toast coconut baked bean strawberry curry grass coffee sardine and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one ron wouldnt touch which turned out to be pepperthe countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder the neat fields had gone now there were woods twisting rivers and dark green hillsthere was a knock on the door of their compartment and the roundfaced boy harry had passed on platform nine and threequarters came in he looked tearfulsorry he said but have you seen a toad at allwhen they shook their heads he wailed ive lost him he keeps getting away from mehell turn up said harryyes said the boy miserably well if you see himhe leftdont know why hes so bothered said ron if id brought a toad id lose it as quick as i could mind you i brought scabbers so i cant talkthe rat was still snoozing on rons laphe might have died and you wouldnt know the difference said ron in disgust i tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting but the spell didnt work ill show you lookhe rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very batteredlooking wand it was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the endunicorn hairs nearly poking out anyway he had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open againthe toadless boy was back but this time he had a girl with him she was already wearing her new hogwarts robeshas anyone seen a toad nevilles lost one she said she had a bossy sort of voice lots of bushy brown hair and rather large front teethweve already told him we havent seen it said ron but the girl wasnt listening she was looking at the wand in his handoh are you doing magic lets see it thenshe sat down ron looked taken abacker all righthe cleared his throatsunshine daisies butter mellow turn this stupid fat rat yellowhe waved his wand but nothing happened scabbers stayed gray and fast asleepare you sure thats a real spell said the girl well its not very good is it ive tried a few simple spells just for practice and its all worked for me nobody in my familys magic at all it was ever such a surprise when i got my letter but i was ever so pleased of course i mean its the very best school of witchcraft there is ive heard ive learned all our course books by heart of course i just hope it will be enough im hermione granger by the way who are youshe said all this very fastharry looked at ron and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadnt learned all the course books by heart eitherim ron weasley ron mutteredharry potter said harryare you really said hermione i know all about you of course i got a few extra books for background reading and youre in modern magical history and the rise and fall of the dark arts and great wizarding events of the twentieth centuryam i said harry feeling dazedgoodness didnt you know id have found out everything i could if it was me said hermione do either of you know what house youll be in ive been asking around and i hope im in gryffindor it sounds by far the best i hear dumbledore himself was in it but i suppose ravenclaw wouldnt be too bad anyway wed better go and look for nevilles toad you two had better change you know i expect well be there soonand she left taking the toadless boy with herwhatever house im in i hope shes not in it said ron he threw his wand back into his trunk stupid spell george gave it to me bet he knew it was a dudwhat house are your brothers in asked harrygryffindor said ron gloom seemed to be settling on him again mom and dad were in it too i dont know what theyll say if im not i dont suppose ravenclaw would be too bad but imagine if they put me in slytherinthats the house vol i mean youknowwho was inyeah said ron he flopped back into his seat looking depressedyou know i think the ends of scabbers whiskers are a bit lightersaid harry trying to take rons mind off houses so what do your oldest brothers do now that theyve left anywayharry was wondering what a wizard did once hed finished schoolcharlies in romania studying dragons and bills in africa doing something for gringotts said ron did you hear about gringotts its been all over the daily prophet but i dont suppose you get that with the muggles someone tried to rob a high security vaultharry staredreally what happened to themnothing thats why its such big news they havent been caught my dad says it mustve been a powerful dark wizard to get round gringotts but they dont think they took anything thats whats odd course everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case youknowwhos behind itharry turned this news over in his mind he was starting to get a prickle of fear every time you knowwho was mentioned he supposed this was all part of entering the magical world but it had been a lot more comfortable saying voldemort without worryingwhats your quidditch team ron askeder i dont know any harry confessedwhat ron looked dumbfounded oh you wait its the best game in the world and he was off explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players describing famous games hed been to with his brothers and the broomstick hed like to get if he had the money he was just taking harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again but it wasnt neville the toadless boy or hermione granger this timethree boys entered and harry recognized the middle one at once it was the pale boy from madam malkins robe shop he was looking at harry with a lot more interest than hed shown back in diagon alleyis it true he said theyre saying all down the train that harry potters in this compartment so its you is ityes said harry he was looking at the other boys both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean standing on either side of the pale boy they looked like bodyguardsoh this is crabbe and this is goyle said the pale boy carelessly noticing where harry was looking and my names malfoy draco malfoyron gave a slight cough which might have been hiding a snigget draco malfoy looked at himthink my names funny do you no need to ask who you are my father told me all the weasleys have red hair freckles and more children than they can affordhe turned back to harry youll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others potter you dont want to go making friends with the wrong sort i can help you therehe held out his hand to shake harrys but harry didnt take iti think i can tell who the wrong sort are for myself thanks he said coollydraco malfoy didnt go red but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeksid be careful if i were you potter he said slowly unless youre a bit politer youll go the same way as your parents they didnt know what was good for them either you hang around with riffraff like the weasleys and that hagrid and itll rub off on youboth harry and ron stood upsay that again ron said his face as red as his hairoh youre going to fight us are you malfoy sneeredunless you get out now said harry more bravely than he felt because crabbe and goyle were a lot bigger than him or ronbut we dont feet like leaving do we boys weve eaten all our food and you still seem to have somegoyle reached toward the chocolate frogs next to ron ron leapt forward but before hed so much as touched goyle goyle let out a horrible yellscabbers the rat was hanging off his finger sharp little teeth sunk deep into goyles knuckle crabbe and malfoy backed away as goyle swung scabbers round and round howling and when scabbets finally flew off and hit the window all three of them disappeared at once perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets or perhaps theyd heard footsteps because a second later hermione granger had come inwhat has been going on she said looking at the sweets all over the floor and ron picking up scabbers by his taili think hes been knocked out ron said to harry he looked closer at scabbers no i dont believe it hes gone back to sleepand so he hadyouve met malfoy beforeharry explained about their meeting in diagon alleyive heard of his family said ron darkly they were some of the first to come back to our side after youknowwho disappeared said theyd been bewitched my dad doesnt believe it he says malfoys father didnt need an excuse to go over to the dark side he turned to hermione can we help you with somethingyoud better hurry up and put your robes on ive just been up to the front to ask the conductor and he says were nearly there you havent been fighting have you youll be in trouble before we even get therescabbers has been fighting not us said ron scowling at her would you mind leaving while we changeall right i only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly racing up and down the corridors said hermione in a sniffy voice and youve got dirt on your nose by the way did you knowron glared at her as she left harry peered out of the window it was getting dark he could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky the train did seem to be slowing downhe and ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robesrons were a bit short for him you could see his sneakers underneath thema voice echoed through the train we will be reaching hogwarts in five minutes time please leave your luggage on the train it will be taken to the school separatelyharrys stomach lurched with nerves and ron he saw looked pale under his freckles they crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridorthe train slowed right down and finally stopped people pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny dark platform harry shivered in the cold night air then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students and harry heard a familiar voice firs years firs years over here all right there harryhagrids big hairy face beamed over the sea of headscmon follow me any more firs years mind yer step now firs years follow meslipping and stumbling they followed hagrid down what seemed to be a steep narrow path it was so dark on either side of them that harry thought there must be thick trees there nobody spoke much neville the boy who kept losing his toad sniffed once or twiceye all get yer firs sight o hogwarts in a sec hagrid called over his shoulder jus round this bend herethere was a loud ooooohthe narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black takeperched atop a high mountain on the other side its windows sparkling in the starry sky was a vast castle with many turrets and towersno moren four to a boat hagrid called pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore harry and ron were followed into their boat by neville and hermione everyone in shouted hagrid who had a boat to himself right then forwardand the fleet of little boats moved off all at once gliding across the lake which was as smooth as glass everyone was silent staring up at the great castle overhead it towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stoodheads down yelled hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face they were carried along a dark tunnel which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle until they reached a kind of underground harbor where they clambered out onto rocks and pebblesoy you there is this your toad said hagrid who was checking the boats as people climbed out of themtrevor cried neville blissfully holding out his hands then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after hagrids lamp coming out at last onto smooth damp grass right in the shadow of the castlethey walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge oak front dooreveryone here you there still got yer toadhagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle doorchapter seventhe sorting hatthe door swung open at once a tall blackhaired witch in emeraldgreen robes stood there she had a very stern face and harrys first thought was that this was not someone to crossthe firs years professor mcgonagall said hagridthank you hagrid i will take them from hereshe pulled the door wide the entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the dursleys house in it the stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at gringotts the ceiling was too high to make out and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floorsthey followed professor mcgonagall across the flagged stone floor harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right the rest of the school must already be here but professor mcgonagall showed the first years into a small empty chamber off the hall they crowded in standing rather closer together than they would usually have done peering about nervouslywelcome to hogwarts said professor mcgonagall the startofterm banquet will begin shortly but before you take your seats in the great hall you will be sorted into your houses the sorting is a very important ceremony because while you are here your house will be something like your family within hogwarts you will have classes with the rest of your house sleep in your house dormitory and spend free time in your house common roomthe four houses are called gryffindor hufflepuff ravenclaw and slytherin each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards while you are at hogwarts your triumphs will earn your house points while any rulebreaking will lose house points at the end of the year the house with the most points is awarded the house cup a great honor i hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yoursthe sorting ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school i suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waitingher eyes lingered for a moment on nevilles cloak which was fastened under his left ear and on rons smudged nose harry nervously tried to flatten his hairi shall return when we are ready for you said professor mcgonagallplease wait quietlyshe left the chamber harry swallowedhow exactly do they sort us into houses he asked ronsome sort of test i think fred said it hurts a lot but i think he was jokingharrys heart gave a horrible jolt a test in front of the whole school but he didnt know any magic yet what on earth would he have to do he hadnt expected something like this the moment they arrivedhe looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified too no one was talking much except hermione granger who was whispering very fast about all the spells shed learned and wondering which one shed need harry tried hard not to listen to her hed never been more nervous never not even when hed had to take a school report home to the dursleys saying that hed somehow turned his teachers wig blue he kept his eyes fixed on the door any second now professor mcgonagall would come back and lead him to his doomthen something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air several people behind him screamedwhat the he gasped so did the people around him about twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall pearlywhite and slightly transparent they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years they seemed to be arguing what looked like a fat little monk was saying forgive and forget i say we ought to give him a second chance my dear friar havent we given peeves all the chances he deserves he gives us all a bad name and you know hes not really even a ghost i say what are you all doing herea ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first yearsnobody answerednew students said the fat friar smiling around at them about to be sorted i supposea few people nodded mutelyhope to see you in hufflepuff said the friar my old house you knowmove along now said a sharp voice the sorting ceremonys about to startprofessor mcgonagall had returned one by one the ghosts floated away through the opposite wallnow form a line professor mcgonagall told the first years and follow mefeeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair with ron behind him and they walked out of the chamber back across the hall and through a pair of double doors into the great hallharry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place it was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables where the rest of the students were sittingthese tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets at the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sittingprofessor mcgonagall led the first years up here so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students with the teachers behind themthe hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight dotted here and there among the students the ghosts shone misty silver mainly to avoid all the staring eyes harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars he heard hermione whisper its bewitched to look like the sky outside i read about it in hogwarts a historyit was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all and that the great hall didnt simply open on to the heavensharry quickly looked down again as professor mcgonagall silently placed a fourlegged stool in front of the first years on top of the stool she put a pointed wizards hat this hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty aunt petunia wouldnt have let it in the housemaybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it harry thought wildly that seemed the sort of thing noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat he stared at it too for a few seconds there was complete silence then the hat twitched a rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth and the hat began to sing oh you may not think im pretty but dont judge on what you see ill eat myself if you can find a smarter hat than meyou can keep your bowlers black your top hats sleek and tall for im the hogwarts sorting hat and i can cap them alltheres nothing hidden in your head the sorting hat cant see so try me on and i will tell you where you ought to beyou might belong in gryffindor where dwell the brave at heart their daring nerve and chivalry set gryffindors apart you might belong in hufflepuff where they are just and loyal those patient hufflepuffis are true and unafraid of toil or yet in wise old ravenclaw if youve a ready mind where those of wit and learning will always find their kind or perhaps in slytherin youll make your real friends those cunning folk use any means to achieve their endsso put me on dont be afraid and dont get in a flap youre in safe hands though i have none for im a thinking capthe whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song it bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still againso weve just got to try on the hat ron whispered to harry ill kill fred he was going on about wrestling a trollharry smiled weakly yes trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching the hat seemed to be asking rather alot harry didnt feel brave or quickwitted or any of it at the moment if only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy that would have been the one for himprofessor mcgonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchmentwhen i call your name you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted she said abbott hannaha pinkfaced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line put on the hat which fell right down over her eyes and sat down a moments pause hufflepuff shouted the hatthe table on the right cheered and clapped as hannah went to sit down at the hufflepuff table harry saw the ghost of the fat friar waving merrily at herbones susanhufflepuff shouted the hat again and susan scuttled off to sit next to hannahboot terryravenclawthe table second from the left clapped this time several ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with terry as he joined thembrocklehurst mandy went to ravenclaw too but brown lavenderbecame the first new gryffindor and the table on the far left exploded with cheers harry could see rons twin brothers catcallingbulstrode millicent then became a slytherin perhaps it was harrys imagination after all hed heard about slytherin but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot he was starting to feel definitely sick now he remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old schoolhe had always been last to be chosen not because he was no good but because no one wanted dudley to think they liked himfinchfletchley justinhufflepuffsometimes harry noticed the hat shouted out the house at once but at others it took a little while to decide finnigan seamus the sandyhaired boy next to harry in the line sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a gryffindorgranger hermionehermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her headgryffindor shouted the hat ron groaneda horrible thought struck harry as horrible thoughts always do when youre very nervous what if he wasnt chosen at all what if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages until professor mcgonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and hed better get back on the train when neville longbottom the boy who kept losing his toad was called he fell over on his way to the stool the hat took a long time to decide with neville when it finally shouted gryffindor neville ran off still wearing it and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to macdougal moragmalfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed slytherinmalfoy went to join his friends crabbe and goyle looking pleased with himselfthere werent many people left now moon nott parkinson then a pair of twin girls patil and patil then perks sallyanne and then at last potter harryas harry stepped forward whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hallpotter did she saythe harry potterthe last thing harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat he waitedhmm said a small voice in his ear difficult very difficult plenty of courage i see not a bad mind either theres talent a my goodness yes and a nice thirst to prove yourself now thats interestingso where shall i put youharry gripped the edges of the stool and thought not slytherin not slytherinnot slytherin eh said the small voice are you sure you could be great you know its all here in your head and slytherin will help you on the way to greatness no doubt about that no well if youre sure better be gryffindorharry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall he took off the hat and walked shakily toward the gryffindor table he was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in slytherin he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet percy the prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously while the weasley twins yelled we got potter we got potter harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff hed seen earlier the ghost patted his arm giving harry the sudden horrible feeling hed just plunged it into a bucket of icecold waterhe could see the high table properly now at the end nearest him sat hagrid who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up harry grinned back and there in the center of the high table in a large gold chair sat albus dumbledore harry recognized him at once from the card hed gotten out of the chocolate frog on the train dumbledores silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts harry spotted professor quirtell too the nervous young man from the leaky cauldron he was looking very peculiar in a large purple turbanand now there were only three people left to be sorted thomas deana black boy even taller than ron joined harry at the gryffindor tableturpin lisa became a ravenclaw and then it was rons turn he was pale green by now harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted gryffindorharry clapped loudly with the rest as ron collapsed into the chair next to himwell done ron excellent said percy weasley pompously across harry as zabini blaise was made a slytherin professor mcgonagall rolled up her scroll and took the sorting hat awayharry looked down at his empty gold plate he had only just realized how hungry he was the pumpkin pasties seemed ages agoalbus dumbledore had gotten to his feet he was beaming at the students his arms opened wide as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all therewelcome he said welcome to a new year at hogwarts before we begin our banquet i would like to say a few words and here they are nitwit blubber oddment tweak thank youhe sat back down everybody clapped and cheered harry didnt know whether to laugh or notis he a bit mad he asked percy uncertainlymad said percy airily hes a genius best wizard in the world but he is a bit mad yes potatoes harryharrys mouth fell open the dishes in front of him were now piled with food he had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table roast beef roast chicken pork chops and lamb chops sausages bacon and steak boiled potatoes roast potatoes fries yorkshire pudding peas carrots gravy ketchup and for some strange reason peppermint humbugsthe dursleys had never exactly starved harry but hed never been allowed to eat as much as he liked dudley had always taken anything that harry really wanted even if it made him sick harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eatit was all deliciousthat does look good said the ghost in the ruff sadly watching harry cut up his steak cant you i havent eaten for nearly four hundred years said the ghost i dont need to of course but one does miss it i dont think ive in troduced myself sir nicholas de mimsyporpington at your service resident ghost of gryffindor toweri know who you are said ron suddenly my brothers told me about you youre nearly headless nicki would prefer you to call me sir nicholas de mimsy the ghost began stiffly but sandyhaired seamus finnigan interruptednearly headless how can you be nearly headlesssir nicholas looked extremely miffed as if their little chat wasnt going at all the way he wantedlike this he said irritably he seized his left ear and pulled his whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge someone had obviously tried to behead him but not done it properly looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces nearly headless nick flipped his head back onto his neck coughed and said so new gryffindors i hope youre going to help us win the house championship this year gryffindors have never gone so long without winning slytherins have got the cup six years in a row the bloody barons becoming almost unbearable hes the slytherin ghostharry looked over at the slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there with blank staring eyes a gaunt face and robes stained with silver blood he was right next to malfoy who harry was pleased to see didnt look too pleased with the seating arrangementshow did he get covered in blood asked seamus with great interestive never asked said nearly headless nick delicatelywhen everyone had eaten as much as they could the remains of the food faded from the plates leaving them sparkling clean as before a moment later the desserts appeared blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of apple pies treacle tarts chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts trifle strawberries jello rice pudding Ã¢â‚¬Å“as harry helped himself to a treacle tart the talk turned to their familiesim halfandhalf said seamus me dads a muggle mom didnt tell him she was a witch til after they were married bit of a nasty shock for himthe others laughedwhat about you neville said ronwell my gran brought me up and shes a witch said neville but the family thought i was all muggle for ages my great uncle algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me he pushed me off the end of blackpool pier once i nearly drowned but nothing happened until i was eight great uncle algie came round for dinner and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my great auntie enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go but i bounced all the way down the garden and into the road they were all really pleased gran was crying she was so happy and you should have seen their faces when i got in here they thought i might not be magic enough to come you see great uncle algie was so pleased he bought me my toadon harrys other side percy weasley and hermione were talking about lessons i do hope they start right away theres so much to learn im particularly interested in transfiguration you know turning something into something else of course its supposed to be very difficult youll be starting small just matches into needles and that sort of thing harry who was starting to feel warm and sleepy looked up at the high table again hagrid was drinking deeply from his gobletprofessor mcgonagall was talking to professor dumbledore professor quirrell in his absurd turban was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair a hooked nose and sallow skinit happened very suddenly the hooknosed teacher looked past quirrells turban straight into harrys eyes and a sharp hot pain shot across the scar on harrys foreheadouch harry clapped a hand to his headwhat is it asked percynnothingthe pain had gone as quickly as it had come harder to shake off was the feeling harry had gotten from the teachers look a feeling that he didnt like harry at allwhos that teacher talking to professor quirrell he asked percyoh you know quirrell already do you no wonder hes looking so nervous thats professor snape he teaches potions but he doesnt want to everyone knows hes after quirrells job knows an awful lot about the dark arts snapeharry watched snape for a while but snape didnt look at him againat last the desserts too disappeared and professor dumbledore got to his feet again the hall fell silentahern just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered i have a few startofterm notices to give youfirst years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils and a few of our older students would do well to remember that as welldumbledores twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the weasley twinsi have also been asked by mr filch the caretaker to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridorsquidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact madam hoochand finally i must tell you that this year the thirdfloor corridor on the righthand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful deathharry laughed but he was one of the few who didhes not serious he muttered to percymust be said percy frowning at dumbledore its odd because he usually gives us a reason why were not allowed to go somewhere the forests full of dangerous beasts everyone knows that i do think he might have told us prefects at leastand now before we go to bed let us sing the school song cried dumbledore harry noticed that the other teachers smiles had become rather fixeddumbledore gave his wand a little flick as if he was trying to get a fly off the end and a long golden ribbon flew out of it which rose high above the tables and twisted itself snakelike into wordseveryone pick their favorite tune said dumbledore and off we goand the school bellowed hogwarts hogwarts hoggy warty hogwarts teach us something please whether we be old and bald or young with scabby knees our heads could do with filling with some interesting stuff for now theyre bare and full of air dead flies and bits of fluff so teach us things worth knowing bring back what weve forgot just do your best well do the rest and learn until our brains all roteverybody finished the song at different times at last only the weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral marchdumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished he was one of those who clapped loudestah music he said wiping his eyes a magic beyond all we do here and now bedtime off you trotthe gryffindor first years followed percy through the chattering crowds out of the great hall and up the marble staircase harrys legs were like lead again but only because he was so tired and full of food he was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed or that twice percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries they climbed more staircases yawning and dragging their feet and harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halta bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them and as percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at himpeeves percy whispered to the first years a poltergeist he raised his voice peeves show yourselfa loud rude sound like the air being let out of a balloon answereddo you want me to go to the bloody baronthere was a pop and a little man with wicked dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared floating cross legged in the air clutching the walking sticksoooooooh he said with an evil cackle ickle firsties what funhe swooped suddenly at them they all duckedgo away peeves or the baronll hear about this i mean it barked percypeeves stuck out his tongue and vanished dropping the walking sticks on nevilles head they heard him zooming away rattling coats of armor as he passedyou want to watch out for peeves said percy as they set off againthe bloody barons the only one who can control him he wont even listen to us prefects here we areat the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dresspassword she said caput draconis said percy and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall they all scrambled through it neville needed a leg up and found themselves in the gryffindor common room a cozy round room full of squashy armchairspercy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another at the top of a spiral staircase they were obviously in one of the towers they found their beds at last five fourposters hung with deep red velvet curtains their trunks had already been brought up too tired to talk much they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bedgreat food isnt it ron muttered to harry through the hangings
