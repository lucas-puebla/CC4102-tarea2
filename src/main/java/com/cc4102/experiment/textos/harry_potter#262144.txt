harry potter and the sorcerers stonechapter onethe boy who livedmr and mrs dursley of number four privet drive were proud to say that they were perfectly normal thank you very much they were the last people youd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious because they just didnt hold with such nonsensemr dursley was the director of a firm called grunnings which made drills he was a big beefy man with hardly any neck although he did have a very large mustache mrs dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences spying on the neighbors the dursleys had a small son called dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywherethe dursleys had everything they wanted but they also had a secret and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it they didnt think they could bear it if anyone found out about the potters mrs potter was mrs dursleys sister but they hadnt met for several years in fact mrs dursley pretended she didnt have a sister because her sister and her goodfornothing husband were as undursleyish as it was possible to be the dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the potters arrived in the street the dursleys knew that the potters had a small son too but they had never even seen him this boy was another good reason for keeping the potters away they didnt want dudley mixing with a child like thatwhen mr and mrs dursley woke up on the dull gray tuesday our story starts there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country mr dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work and mrs dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming dudley into his high chairnone of them noticed a large tawny owl flutter past the windowat half past eight mr dursley picked up his briefcase pecked mrs dursley on the cheek and tried to kiss dudley goodbye but missed because dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls little tyke chortled mr dursley as he left the house he got into his car and backed out of number fours driveit was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar a cat reading a map for a second mr dursley didnt realize what he had seen then he jerked his head around to look again there was a tabby cat standing on the corner of privet drive but there wasnt a map in sight what could he have been thinking of it must have been a trick of the light mr dursley blinked and stared at the cat it stared back as mr dursley drove around the corner and up the road he watched the cat in his mirror it was now reading the sign that said privet drive no looking at the sign cats couldnt read maps or signs mr dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind as he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that daybut on the edge of town drills were driven out of his mind by something else as he sat in the usual morning traffic jam he couldnt help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about people in cloaks mr dursley couldnt bear people who dressed in funny clothes the getups you saw on young people he supposed this was some stupid new fashion he drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by they were whispering excitedly together mr dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them werent young at all why that man had to be older than he was and wearing an emeraldgreen cloak the nerve of him but then it struck mr dursley that this was probably some silly stunt these people were obviously collecting for somethingyes that would be it the traffic moved on and a few minutes later mr dursley arrived in the grunnings parking lot his mind back on drillsmr dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor if he hadnt he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning he didnt see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight though people down in the street did they pointed and gazed open mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime mr dursley however had a perfectly normal owlfree morning he yelled at five different people he made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more he was in a very good mood until lunchtime when he thought hed stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakeryhed forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the bakers he eyed them angrily as he passed he didnt know why but they made him uneasy this bunch were whispering excitedly too and he couldnt see a single collecting tin it was on his way back past them clutching a large doughnut in a bag that he caught a few words of what they were sayingthe potters thats right thats what i heard yes their son harrymr dursley stopped dead fear flooded him he looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them but thought better of ithe dashed back across the road hurried up to his office snapped at his secretary not to disturb him seized his telephone and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind he put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache thinking no he was being stupid potter wasnt such an unusual name he was sure there were lots of people called potter who had a son called harry come to think of it he wasnt even sure his nephew was called harry hed never even seen the boy it might have been harvey or harold there was no point in worrying mrs dursley she always got so upset at any mention of her sister he didnt blame her if hed had a sister like that but all the same those people in cloakshe found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five oclock he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the doorsorry he grunted as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell it was a few seconds before mr dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak he didnt seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground on the contrary his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare dont be sorry my dear sir for nothing could upset me today rejoice for youknowwho has gone at last even muggles like yourself should be celebrating this happy happy dayand the old man hugged mr dursley around the middle and walked offmr dursley stood rooted to the spot he had been hugged by a complete stranger he also thought he had been called a muggle whatever that was he was rattled he hurried to his car and set off for home hoping he was imagining things which he had never hoped before because he didnt approve of imaginationas he pulled into the driveway of number four the first thing he saw and it didnt improve his mood was the tabby cat hed spotted that morning it was now sitting on his garden wall he was sure it was the same one it had the same markings around its eyesshoo said mr dursley loudly the cat didnt move it just gave him a stern look was this normal cat behavior mr dursley wondered trying to pull himself together he let himself into the house he was still determined not to mention anything to his wifemrs dursley had had a nice normal day she told him over dinner all about mrs next doors problems with her daughter and how dudley had learned a new word wont mr dursley tried to act normally when dudley had been put to bed he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news and finally birdwatchers everywhere have reported that the nations owls have been behaving very unusually today although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern the newscaster allowed himself a grinmost mysterious and now over to jim mcguffin with the weather going to be any more showers of owls tonight jimwell ted said the weatherman i dont know about that but its not only the owls that have been acting oddly today viewers as far apart as kent yorkshire and dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain i promised yesterday theyve had a downpour of shooting stars perhaps people have been celebrating bonfire night early its not until next week folks but i can promise a wet night tonightmr dursley sat frozen in his armchair shooting stars all over britain owls flying by daylight mysterious people in cloaks all over the place and a whisper a whisper about the pottersmrs dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea it was no good hed have to say something to her he cleared his throat nervously er petunia dear you havent heard from your sister lately have youas he had expected mrs dursley looked shocked and angry after all they normally pretended she didnt have a sisterno she said sharply whyfunny stuff on the news mr dursley mumbled owls shooting stars and there were a lot of funnylooking people in town todayso snapped mrs dursleywell i just thought maybe it was something to do with you know her crowdmrs dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips mr dursley wondered whether he dared tell her hed heard the name potter he decided he didnt dare instead he said as casually as he could their son hed be about dudleys age now wouldnt hei suppose so said mrs dursley stifflywhats his name again howard isnt itharry nasty common name if you ask meoh yes said mr dursley his heart sinking horribly yes i quite agreehe didnt say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bedwhile mrs dursley was in the bathroom mr dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden the cat was still thereit was staring down privet drive as though it were waiting for somethingwas he imagining things could all this have anything to do with the potters if it did if it got out that they were related to a pair of well he didnt think he could bear itthe dursleys got into bed mrs dursley fell asleep quickly but mr dursley lay awake turning it all over in his mind his last comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the potters were involved there was no reason for them to come near him and mrs dursley the potters knew very well what he and petunia thought about them and their kind he couldnt see how he and petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on he yawned and turned over it couldnt affect themhow very wrong he wasmr dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness it was sitting as still as a statue its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of privet drive it didnt so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street nor when two owls swooped overhead in fact it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at alla man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching appeared so suddenly and silently youd have thought hed just popped out of the ground the cats tail twitched and its eyes narrowednothing like this man had ever been seen on privet drive he was tall thin and very old judging by the silver of his hair and beard which were both long enough to tuck into his belt he was wearing long robes a purple cloak that swept the ground and highheeled buckled bootshis blue eyes were light bright and sparkling behind halfmoon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked as though it had been broken at least twice this mans name was albus dumbledorealbus dumbledore didnt seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome he was busy rummaging in his cloak looking for something but he did seem to realize he was being watched because he looked up suddenly at the cat which was still staring at him from the other end of the street for some reason the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him he chuckled and muttered i should have knownhe found what he was looking for in his inside pocket it seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter he flicked it open held it up in the air and clicked it the nearest street lamp went out with a little pop he clicked it again the next lamp flickered into darkness twelve times he clicked the putouter until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance which were the eyes of the cat watching him if anyone looked out of their window now even beadyeyed mrs dursley they wouldnt be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement dumbledore slipped the putouter back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four where he sat down on the wall next to the cat he didnt look at it but after a moment he spoke to itfancy seeing you here professor mcgonagallhe turned to smile at the tabby but it had gone instead he was smiling at a rather severelooking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes she too was wearing a cloak an emerald one her black hair was drawn into a tight bun she looked distinctly ruffledhow did you know it was me she askedmy dear professor i ve never seen a cat sit so stifflyyoud be stiff if youd been sitting on a brick wall all day said professor mcgonagallall day when you could have been celebrating i must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way hereprofessor mcgonagall sniffed angrilyoh yes everyones celebrating all right she said impatientlyyoud think theyd be a bit more careful but no even the muggles have noticed somethings going on it was on their news she jerked her head back at the dursleys dark livingroom window i heard it flocks of owls shooting stars well theyre not completely stupid they were bound to notice something shooting stars down in kent ill bet that was dedalus diggle he never had much senseyou cant blame them said dumbledore gently weve had precious little to celebrate for eleven yearsi know that said professor mcgonagall irritably but thats no reason to lose our heads people are being downright careless out on the streets in broad daylight not even dressed in muggle clothes swapping rumorsshe threw a sharp sideways glance at dumbledore here as though hoping he was going to tell her something but he didnt so she went on a fine thing it would be if on the very day youknowwho seems to have disappeared at last the muggles found out about us all i suppose he really has gone dumbledoreit certainly seems so said dumbledore we have much to be thankful for would you care for a lemon dropa whata lemon drop theyre a kind of muggle sweet im rather fond ofno thank you said professor mcgonagall coldly as though she didnt think this was the moment for lemon drops as i say even if youknowwho has gone my dear professor surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name all this you knowwho nonsense for eleven years i have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name voldemort professor mcgonagall flinched but dumbledore who was unsticking two lemon drops seemed not to notice it all gets so confusing if we keep saying youknowwho i have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying voldemorts namei know you haven t said professor mcgonagall sounding half exasperated half admiring but youre different everyone knows youre the only one youknow oh all right voldemort was frightened ofyou flatter me said dumbledore calmly voldemort had powers i will never haveonly because youre too well noble to use themits lucky its dark i havent blushed so much since madam pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffsprofessor mcgonagall shot a sharp look at dumbledore and said the owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around you know what everyones saying about why hes disappeared about what finally stopped himit seemed that professor mcgonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss the real reason she had been waiting on a cold hard wall all day for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now it was plain that whatever everyone was saying she was not going to believe it until dumbledore told her it was true dumbledore however was choosing another lemon drop and did not answerwhat theyre saying she pressed on is that last night voldemort turned up in godrics hollow he went to find the potters the rumor is that lily and james potter are are that theyre dead Ã¢â‚¬Å“dumbledore bowed his head professor mcgonagall gaspedlily and james i cant believe it i didnt want to believe itoh albusdumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder i know i know he said heavilyprofessor mcgonagalls voice trembled as she went on thats not alltheyre saying he tried to kill the potters son harry but he couldnt he couldnt kill that little boy no one knows why or how but theyre saying that when he couldnt kill harry potter voldemorts power somehow broke and thats why hes gonedumbledore nodded glumlyits its true faltered professor mcgonagall after all hes done all the people hes killed he couldnt kill a little boy its just astounding of all the things to stop him but how in the name of heaven did harry survivewe can only guess said dumbledore we may never knowprofessor mcgonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it it was a very odd watchit had twelve hands but no numbers instead little planets were moving around the edge it must have made sense to dumbledore though because he put it back in his pocket and said hagrids late i suppose it was he who told you id be here by the wayyes said professor mcgonagall and i dont suppose youre going to tell me why youre here of all placesive come to bring harry to his aunt and uncle theyre the only family he has left nowyou dont mean you cant mean the people who live here cried professor mcgonagall jumping to her feet and pointing at number fourdumbledore you cant ive been watching them all day you couldnt find two people who are less like us and theyve got this son i saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street screaming for sweetsharry potter come and live hereits the best place for him said dumbledore firmly his aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when hes older ive written them a lettera letter repeated professor mcgonagall faintly sitting back down on the wall really dumbledore you think you can explain all this in a letter these people will never understand him hell be famous a legend i wouldnt be surprised if today was known as harry potter day in the future there will be books written about harry every child in our world will know his nameexactly said dumbledore looking very seriously over the top of his halfmoon glasses it would be enough to turn any boys head famous before he can walk and talk famous for something he wont even remember cara you see how much better off hell be growing up away from all that until hes ready to take itprofessor mcgonagall opened her mouth changed her mind swallowed and then said yes yes youre right of course but how is the boy getting here dumbledore she eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding harry underneath ithagrids bringing himyou think it wise to trust hagrid with something as important as thisi would trust hagrid with my life said dumbledoreim not saying his heart isnt in the right place said professor mcgonagall grudgingly but you cant pretend hes not careless he does tend to what was thata low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them it grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of themif the motorcycle was huge it was nothing to the man sitting astride it he was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide he looked simply too big to be allowed and so wild long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face he had hands the size of trash can lids and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins in his vast muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blanketshagrid said dumbledore sounding relieved at last and where did you get that motorcycleborrowed it professor dumbledore sit said the giant climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke young sirius black lent it to me ive got him sirno problems were thereno sir house was almost destroyed but i got him out all right before the muggles started swarmin around he fell asleep as we was flyin over bristoldumbledore and professor mcgonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets inside just visible was a baby boy fast asleep under a tuft of jetblack hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut like a bolt of lightningis that where whispered professor mcgonagallyes said dumbledore hell have that scar forevercouldnt you do something about it dumbledoreeven if i could i wouldnt scars can come in handy i have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the london underground well give him here hagrid wed better get this over withdumbledore took harry in his arms and turned toward the dursleys housecould i could i say goodbye to him sir asked hagrid he bent his great shaggy head over harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy whiskery kiss then suddenly hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dogshhh hissed professor mcgonagall youll wake the mugglessssorry sobbed hagrid taking out a large spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it but i cccant stand it lily an james dead an poor little harry off ter live with muggles yes yes its all very sad but get a grip on yourself hagrid or well be found professor mcgonagall whispered patting hagrid gingerly on the arm as dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door he laid harry gently on the doorstep took a letter out of his cloak tucked it inside harrys blankets and then came back to the other two for a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle hagrids shoulders shook professor mcgonagall blinked furiously and the twinkling light that usually shone from dumbledores eyes seemed to have gone outwell said dumbledore finally thats that weve no business staying here we may as well go and join the celebrationsyeah said hagrid in a very muffled voice ill be takin sirius his bike back gnight professor mcgonagall professor dumbledore sirwiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life with a roar it rose into the air and off into the nighti shall see you soon i expect professor mcgonagall said dumbledore nodding to her professor mcgonagall blew her nose in replydumbledore turned and walked back down the street on the corner he stopped and took out the silver putouter he clicked it once and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that privet drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street he could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number fourgood luck harry he murmured he turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak he was gonea breeze ruffled the neat hedges of privet drive which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen harry potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up one small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on not knowing he was special not knowing he was famous not knowing he would be woken in a few hours time by mrs dursleys scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin dudley he couldnt know that at this very moment people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices to harry potter the boy who livedchapter twothe vanishing glassnearly ten years had passed since the dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step but privet drive had hardly changed at all the sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the dursleys front door it crept into their living room which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when mr dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passedten years ago there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing differentcolored bonnets but dudley dursley was no longer a baby and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle on a carousel at the fair playing a computer game with his father being hugged and kissed by his motherthe room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house tooyet harry potter was still there asleep at the moment but not for long his aunt petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the dayup get up nowharry woke with a start his aunt rapped on the door againup she screeched harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove he rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having it had been a good one there had been a flying motorcycle in it he had a funny feeling hed had the same dream beforehis aunt was back outside the doorare you up yet she demandednearly said harrywell get a move on i want you to look after the bacon and dont you dare let it burn i want everything perfect on duddys birthdayharry groanedwhat did you say his aunt snapped through the doornothing nothingdudleys birthday how could he have forgotten harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks he found a pair under his bed and after pulling a spider off one of them put them on harry was used to spiders because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them and that was where he sleptwhen he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen the table was almost hidden beneath all dudleys birthday presents it looked as though dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted not to mention the second television and the racing bike exactly why dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to harry as dudley was very fat and hated exercise unless of course it involved punching somebody dudleys favorite punching bag was harry but he couldnt often catch him harry didnt look it but he was very fastperhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard but harry had always been small and skinny for his age he looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of dudleys and dudley was about four times bigger than he was harry had a thin face knobbly knees black hair and bright green eyes he wore round glasses held together with a lot of scotch tape because of all the times dudley had punched him on the nose the only thing harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning he had had it as long as he could remember and the first question he could ever remember asking his aunt petunia was how he had gotten itin the car crash when your parents died she had said and dont ask questionsdont ask questions that was the first rule for a quiet life with the dursleysuncle vernon entered the kitchen as harry was turning over the baconcomb your hair he barked by way of a morning greetingabout once a week uncle vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that harry needed a haircut harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together but it made no difference his hair simply grew that way all over the placeharry was frying eggs by the time dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother dudley looked a lot like uncle vernon he had a large pink face not much neck small watery blue eyes and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick fat head aunt petunia often said that dudley looked like a baby angel harry often said that dudley looked like a pig in a wigharry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table which was difficult as there wasnt much room dudley meanwhile was counting his presentshis face fellthirtysix he said looking up at his mother and father thats two less than last yeardarling you havent counted auntie marges present see its here under this big one from mommy and daddyall right thirtyseven then said dudley going red in the faceharry who could see a huge dudley tantrum coming on began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case dudley turned the table overaunt petunia obviously scented danger too because she said quickly and well buy you another two presents while were out today hows that popkin two more presents is that all right dudley thought for a moment it looked like hard work finally he said slowly so ill have thirty thirtythirtynine sweetums said aunt petuniaoh dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel all right thenuncle vernon chuckled little tyke wants his moneys worth just like his father atta boy dudley he ruffled dudleys hairat that moment the telephone rang and aunt petunia went to answer it while harry and uncle vernon watched dudley unwrap the racing bike a video camera a remote control airplane sixteen new computer games and a vcr he was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when aunt petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worriedbad news vernon she said mrs figgs broken her leg she cant take him she jerked her head in harrys directiondudleys mouth fell open in horror but harrys heart gave a leap every year on dudleys birthday his parents took him and a friend out for the day to adventure parks hamburger restaurants or the movies every year harry was left behind with mrs figg a mad old lady who lived two streets away harry hated it there the whole house smelled of cabbage and mrs figg made him look at photographs of all the cats shed ever ownednow what said aunt petunia looking furiously at harry as though hed planned this harry knew he ought to feel sorry that mrs figg had broken her leg but it wasnt easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at tibbles snowy mr paws and tufty againwe could phone marge uncle vernon suggesteddont be silly vernon she hates the boythe dursleys often spoke about harry like this as though he wasnt there or rather as though he was something very nasty that couldnt understand them like a slugwhat about whatshername your friend yvonneon vacation in majorca snapped aunt petuniayou could just leave me here harry put in hopefully hed be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on dudleys computeraunt petunia looked as though shed just swallowed a lemonand come back and find the house in ruins she snarledi wont blow up the house said harry but they werent listeningi suppose we could take him to the zoo said aunt petunia slowly and leave him in the carthat cars new hes not sitting in it alonedudley began to cry loudly in fact he wasnt really crying it had been years since hed really cried but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed his mother would give him anything he wanteddinky duddydums dont cry mummy wont let him spoil your special day she cried flinging her arms around himi dont want him ttto come dudley yelled between huge pretend sobs he always sp spoils everything he shot harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mothers armsjust then the doorbell rang oh good lord theyre here said aunt petunia frantically and a moment later dudleys best friend piers polkiss walked in with his mother piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat he was usually the one who held peoples arms behind their backs while dudley hit them dudley stopped pretending to cry at oncehalf an hour later harry who couldnt believe his luck was sitting in the back of the dursleys car with piers and dudley on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life his aunt and uncle hadnt been able to think of anything else to do with him but before theyd left uncle vernon had taken harry asideim warning you he had said putting his large purple face right up close to harrys im warning you now boy any funny business anything at all and youll be in that cupboard from now until christmasim not going to do anything said harry honestlybut uncle vernon didnt believe him no one ever didthe problem was strange things often happened around harry and it was just no good telling the dursleys he didnt make them happenonce aunt petunia tired of harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadnt been at all had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs which she left to hide that horrible scar dudley had laughed himself silly at harry who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glassesnext morning however he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before aunt petunia had sheared it off he had been given a week in his cupboard for this even though he had tried to explain that he couldnt explain how it had grown back so quicklyanother time aunt petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of dudleys brown with orange puff balls the harder she tried to pull it over his head the smaller it seemed to become until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet but certainly wouldnt fit harry aunt petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and to his great relief harry wasnt punishedon the other hand hed gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens dudleys gang had been chasing him as usual when as much to harrys surprise as anyone elses there he was sitting on the chimney the dursleys had received a very angry letter from harrys headmistress telling them harry had been climbing school buildings but all hed tried to do as he shouted at uncle vernon through the locked door of his cupboard was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid jumpbut today nothing was going to go wrong it was even worth being with dudley and piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasnt school his cupboard or mrs figgs cabbagesmelling living roomwhile he drove uncle vernon complained to aunt petunia he liked to complain about things people at work harry the council harry the bank and harry were just a few of his favorite subjects this morning it was motorcyclesroaring along like maniacs the young hoodlums he said as a motorcycle overtook themi had a dream about a motorcycle said harry remembering suddenly it was flyinguncle vernon nearly crashed into the car in front he turned right around in his seat and yelled at harry his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache motorcycles dont flydudley and piers sniggeredi know they dont said harry it was only a dreambut he wished he hadnt said anything if there was one thing the dursleys hated even more than his asking questions it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldnt no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideasit was a very sunny saturday and the zoo was crowded with families the dursleys bought dudley and piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then because the smiling lady in the van had asked harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop it wasnt bad either harry thought licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like dudley except that it wasnt blondharry had the best morning hed had in a long time he was careful to walk a little way apart from the dursleys so that dudley and piers who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime wouldnt fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him they ate in the zoo restaurant and when dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didnt have enough ice cream on top uncle vernon bought him another one and harry was allowed to finish the firstharry felt afterward that he should have known it was all too good to lastafter lunch they went to the reptile house it was cool and dark in there with lit windows all along the walls behind the glass all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone dudley and piers wanted to see huge poisonous cobras and thick mancrushing pythons dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place it could have wrapped its body twice around uncle vernons car and crushed it into a trash can but at the moment it didnt look in the mood in fact it was fast asleepdudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass staring at the glistening brown coilsmake it move he whined at his father uncle vernon tapped on the glass but the snake didnt budgedo it again dudley ordered uncle vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles but the snake just snoozed onthis is boring dudley moaned he shuffled awayharry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake he wouldnt have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long it was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom where the only visitor was aunt petunia hammering on the door to wake you up at least he got to visit the rest of the housethe snake suddenly opened its beady eyes slowly very slowly it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with harrysit winkedharry stared then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching they werent he looked back at the snake and winked toothe snake jerked its head toward uncle vernon and dudley then raised its eyes to the ceiling it gave harry a look that said quite plainly i get that all the timei know harry murmured through the glass though he wasnt sure the snake could hear him it must be really annoyingthe snake nodded vigorouslywhere do you come from anyway harry askedthe snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass harry peered at itboa constrictor brazilwas it nice therethe boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and harry read on this specimen was bred in the zoo oh i see so youve never been to brazilas the snake shook its head a deafening shout behind harry made both of them jumpdudley mr dursley come and look at this snake you wont believe what its doingdudley came waddling toward them as fast as he couldout of the way you he said punching harry in the ribs caught by surprise harry fell hard on the concrete floor what came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened one second piers and dudley were leaning right up close to the glass the next they had leapt back with howls of horrorharry sat up and gasped the glass front of the boa constrictors tank had vanished the great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly slithering out onto the floor people throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exitsas the snake slid swiftly past him harry could have sworn a low hissing voice said brazil here i come thanksss amigothe keeper of the reptile house was in shockbut the glass he kept saying where did the glass gothe zoo director himself made aunt petunia a cup of strong sweet tea while he apologized over and over again piers and dudley could only gibber as far as harry had seen the snake hadnt done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed but by the time they were all back in uncle vernons car dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg while piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death but worst of all for harry at least was piers calming down enough to say harry was talking to it werent you harryuncle vernon waited until piers was safely out of the house before starting on harry he was so angry he could hardly speak he managed to say go cupboard stay no meals before he collapsed into a chair and aunt petunia had to run and get him a large brandyharry lay in his dark cupboard much later wishing he had a watch he didnt know what time it was and he couldnt be sure the dursleys were asleep yet until they were he couldnt risk sneaking to the kitchen for some foodhed lived with the dursleys almost ten years ten miserable years as long as he could remember ever since hed been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash he couldnt remember being in the car when his parents had died sometimes when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard he came up with a strange vision a blinding flash of green light and a burn ing pain on his forehead this he supposed was the crash though he couldnt imagine where all the green light came from he couldnt remember his parents at all his aunt and uncle never spoke about them and of course he was forbidden to ask questions there were no photographs of them in the housewhen he had been younger harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away but it had never happened the dursleys were his only family yet sometimes he thought or maybe hoped that strangers in the street seemed to know him very strange strangers they were too a tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with aunt petunia and dudley after asking harry furiously if he knew the man aunt petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything a wildlooking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus a bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word the weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second harry tried to get a closer lookat school harry had no one everybody knew that dudleys gang hated that odd harry potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses and nobody liked to disagree with dudleys gangchapter threethe letters from no onethe escape of the brazilian boa constrictor earned harry his longestever punishment by the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again the summer holidays had started and dudley had already broken his new video camera crashed his remote control airplane and first time out on his racing bike knocked down old mrs figg as she crossed privet drive on her crutchesharry was glad school was over but there was no escaping dudleys gang who visited the house every single day piers dennis malcolm and gordon were all big and stupid but as dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot he was the leader the rest of them were all quite happy to join in dudleys favorite sport harry huntingthis was why harry spent as much time as possible out of the house wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays where he could see a tiny ray of hope when september came he would be going off to secondary school and for the first time in his life he wouldnt be with dudley dudley had been accepted at uncle vernons old private school smeltings piers polkiss was going there too harry on the other hand was going to stonewall high the local public school dudley thought this was very funnythey stuff peoples heads down the toilet the first day at stonewallhe told harry want to come upstairs and practiceno thanks said harry the poor toilets never had anything as horrible as your head down it it might be sick then he ran before dudley could work out what hed saidone day in july aunt petunia took dudley to london to buy his smeltings uniform leaving harry at mrs figgs mrs figg wasn t as bad as usual it turned out shed broken her leg tripping over one of her cats and she didnt seem quite as fond of them as before she let harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though shed had it for several yearsthat evening dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brandnew uniform smeltings boys wore maroon tailcoats orange knickerbockers and flat straw hats called boaters they also carried knobbly sticks used for hitting each other while the teachers werent looking this was supposed to be good training for later lifeas he looked at dudley in his new knickerbockers uncle vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life aunt petunia burst into tears and said she couldnt believe it was her ickle dudleykins he looked so handsome and grownup harry didnt trust himself to speak he thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laughthere was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when harry went in for breakfast it seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink he went to have a look the tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray waterwhats this he asked aunt petunia her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a questionyour new school uniform she saidharry looked in the bowl againoh he said i didnt realize it had to be so wetdota be stupid snapped aunt petunia im dyeing some of dudleys old things gray for you itll look just like everyone elses when ive finishedharry seriously doubted this but thought it best not to argue he sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at stonewall high like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin probablydudley and uncle vernon came in both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from harrys new uniform uncle vernon opened his newspaper as usual and dudley banged his smelting stick which he carried everywhere on the tablethey heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormatget the mail dudley said uncle vernon from behind his papermake harry get itget the mail harrymake dudley get itpoke him with your smelting stick dudleyharry dodged the smelting stick and went to get the mail three things lay on the doormat a postcard from uncle vernons sister marge who was vacationing on the isle of wight a brown envelope that looked like a bill and a letter for harryharry picked it up and stared at it his heart twanging like a giant elastic band no one ever in his whole life had written to him who would he had no friends no other relatives he didnt belong to the library so hed never even got rude notes asking for books back yet here it was a letter addressed so plainly there could be no mistake mr h potter the cupboard under the stairs privet drive little whinging surrey the envelope was thick and heavy made of yellowish parchment and the address was written in emeraldgreen ink there was no stampturning the envelope over his hand trembling harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms a lion an eagle a badger and a snake surrounding a large letter hhurry up boy shouted uncle vernon from the kitchen what are you doing checking for letter bombs he chuckled at his own jokeharry went back to the kitchen still staring at his letter he handed uncle vernon the bill and the postcard sat down and slowly began to open the yellow envelopeuncle vernon ripped open the bill snorted in disgust and flipped over the postcardmarges ill he informed aunt petunia ate a funny whelk dad said dudley suddenly dad harrys got somethingharry was on the point of unfolding his letter which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by uncle vernonthats mine said harry trying to snatch it backwhod be writing to you sneered uncle vernon shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it his face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights and it didnt stop there within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridgepppetunia he gaspeddudley tried to grab the letter to read it but uncle vernon held it high out of his reach aunt petunia took it curiously and read the first line for a moment it looked as though she might faint she clutched her throat and made a choking noisevernon oh my goodness vernonthey stared at each other seeming to have forgotten that harry and dudley were still in the room dudley wasnt used to being ignored he gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his smelting sticki want to read that letter he said loudly want to read it said harry furiously as its mineget out both of you croaked uncle vernon stuffing the letter back inside its envelopeharry didnt movei want my letter he shoutedlet me see it demanded dudleyout roared uncle vernon and he took both harry and dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall slamming the kitchen door behind them harry and dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole dudley won so harry his glasses dangling from one ear lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floorvernon aunt petunia was saying in a quivering voice look at the address how could they possibly know where he sleeps you dont think theyre watching the housewatching spying might be following us muttered uncle vernon wildlybut what should we do vernon should we write back tell them we dont want harry could see uncle vernons shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchenno he said finally no well ignore it if they dont get an answer yes thats best we wont do anythingbut im not having one in the house petunia didnt we swear when we took him in wed stamp out that dangerous nonsensethat evening when he got back from work uncle vernon did something hed never done before he visited harry in his cupboardwheres my letter said harry the moment uncle vernon had squeezed through the door whos writing to meno one it was addressed to you by mistake said uncle vernon shortlyi have burned itit was not a mistake said harry angrily it had my cupboard on itsilence yelled uncle vernon and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling he took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile which looked quite painfuler yes harry about this cupboard your aunt and i have been thinking youre really getting a bit big for it we think it might be nice if you moved into dudleys second bedroomwhy said harrydont ask questions snapped his uncle take this stuff upstairs nowthe dursleys house had four bedrooms one for uncle vernon and aunt petunia one for visitors usually uncle vernons sister marge one where dudley slept and one where dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldnt fit into his first bedroom it only took harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room he sat down on the bed and stared around him nearly everything in here was broken the monthold video camera was lying on top of a small working tank dudley had once driven over the next door neighbors dog in the corner was dudleys firstever television set which hed put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled there was a large birdcage which had once held a parrot that dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because dudley had sat on it other shelves were full of books they were the only things in the room that looked as though theyd never been touchedfrom downstairs came the sound of dudley bawling at his mother i dont want him in there i need that room make him get outharry sighed and stretched out on the bed yesterday hed have given anything to be up here today hed rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without itnext morning at breakfast everyone was rather quiet dudley was in shock hed screamed whacked his father with his smelting stick been sick on purpose kicked his mother and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof and he still didnt have his room back harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing hed opened the letter in the hall uncle vernon and aunt petunia kept looking at each other darklywhen the mail arrived uncle vernon who seemed to be trying to be nice to harry made dudley go and get it they heard him banging things with his smelting stick all the way down the hall then he shouted theres another one mr h potter the smallest bedroom privet drive Ã¢â‚¬Å“with a strangled cry uncle vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall harry right behind him uncle vernon had to wrestle dudley to the ground to get the letter from him which was made difficult by the fact that harry had grabbed uncle vernon around the neck from behind after a minute of confused fighting in which everyone got hit a lot by the smelting stick uncle vernon straightened up gasping for breath with harrys letter clutched in his handgo to your cupboard i mean your bedroom he wheezed at harrydudley go just goharry walked round and round his new room someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadnt received his first letter surely that meant theyd try again and this time hed make sure they didnt fail he had a planthe repaired alarm clock rang at six oclock the next morning harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently he mustnt wake the dursleys he stole downstairs without turning on any of the lightshe was going to wait for the postman on the corner of privet drive and get the letters for number four first his heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door harry leapt into the air hed trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat something alive lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror harry realized that the big squashy something had been his uncles face uncle vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag clearly making sure that harry didnt do exactly what hed been trying to do he shouted at harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back the mail had arrived right into uncle vernons lapharry could see three letters addressed in green inki want he began but uncle vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes uncle vernon didnt go to work that day he stayed at home and nailed up the mail slotsee he explained to aunt petunia through a mouthful of nails if they cant deliver them theyll just give upim not sure thatll work vernonoh these peoples minds work in strange ways petunia theyre not like you and me said uncle vernon trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake aunt petunia had just brought himon friday no less than twelve letters arrived for harry as they couldnt go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door slotted through the sides and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroomuncle vernon stayed at home again after burning all the letters he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out he hummed tiptoe through the tulipsas he worked and jumped at small noiseson saturday things began to get out of hand twentyfour letters to harry found their way into the house rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed aunt petunia through the living room window while uncle vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to aunt petunia shredded the letters in her food processorwho on earth wants to talk to you this badly dudley asked harry in amazementon sunday morning uncle vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill but happyno post on sundays he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers no damn letters today something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head next moment thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets the dursleys ducked but harry leapt into the air trying to catch oneout outuncle vernon seized harry around the waist and threw him into the hallwhen aunt petunia and dudley had run out with their arms over their faces uncle vernon slammed the door shut they could hear the letters still streaming into the room bouncing off the walls and floorthat does it said uncle vernon trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time i want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave were going away just pack some clothes no argumentshe looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boardedup doors and were in the car speeding toward the highwaydudley was sniffling in the back seat his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television vcr and computer in his sports bagthey drove and they drove even aunt petunia didnt dare ask where they were going every now and then uncle vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while shakeem off shake em off he would mutter whenever he did thisthey didnt stop to eat or drink all day by nightfall dudley was howling hed never had such a bad day in his life he was hungry hed missed five television programs hed wanted to see and hed never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computeruncle vernon stopped at last outside a gloomylooking hotel on the outskirts of a big city dudley and harry shared a room with twin beds and damp musty sheets dudley snored but harry stayed awake sitting on the windowsill staring down at the lights of passing cars and wonderingthey ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day they had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their tablescuse me but is one of you mr h potter only i got about an undred of these at the front deskshe held up a letter so they could read the green ink address mr h potter room railview hotel cokeworth harry made a grab for the letter but uncle vernon knocked his hand out of the way the woman staredill take them said uncle vernon standing up quickly and following her from the dining roomwouldnt it be better just to go home dear aunt petunia suggested timidly hours later but uncle vernon didnt seem to hear her exactly what he was looking for none of them knew he drove them into the middle of a forest got out looked around shook his head got back in the car and off they went again the same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field halfway across a suspension bridge and at the top of a multilevel parking garagedaddys gone mad hasnt he dudley asked aunt petunia dully late that afternoon uncle vernon had parked at the coast locked them all inside the car and disappearedit started to rain great drops beat on the roof of the car dud ley sniveledits monday he told his mother the great humbertos on tonight i want to stay somewhere with a television Ã¢â‚¬Å“monday this reminded harry of something if it was monday and you could usually count on dudley to know the days the week because of television then tomorrow tuesday was harrys eleventh birthday of course his birthdays were never exactly fun last year the dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of uncle vernons old socksstill you werent eleven every dayuncle vernon was back and he was smiling he was also carrying a long thin package and didnt answer aunt petunia when she asked what hed boughtfound the perfect place he said come on everyone outit was very cold outside the car uncle vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine one thing was certain there was no television in therestorm forecast for tonight said uncle vernon gleefully clapping his hands together and this gentlemans kindly agreed to lend us his boata toothless old man came ambling up to them pointing with a rather wicked grin at an old rowboat bobbing in the irongray water below themive already got us some rations said uncle vernon so all aboardit was freezing in the boat icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces after what seemed like hours they reached the rock where uncle vernon slipping and sliding led the way to the brokendown housethe inside was horrible it smelled strongly of seaweed the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls and the fireplace was damp and empty there were only two roomsuncle vernons rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas he tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled upcould do with some of those letters now eh he said cheerfullyhe was in a very good mood obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail harry privately agreed though the thought didnt cheer him up at allas night fell the promised storm blew up around them spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows aunt petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for dudley on the motheaten sofa she and uncle vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door and harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest most ragged blanketthe storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on harry couldnt sleep he shivered and turned over trying to get comfortable his stomach rumbling with hunger dudleys snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight the lighted dial of dudleys watch which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist told harry hed be eleven in ten minutes time he lay and watched his birthday tick nearer wondering if the dursleys would remember at all wondering where the letter writer was nowfive minutes to go harry heard something creak outside he hoped the roof wasnt going to fall in although he might be warmer if it didfour minutes to go maybe the house in privet drive would be so full of letters when they got back that hed be able to steal one somehowthree minutes to go was that the sea slapping hard on the rock like that and two minutes to go what was that funny crunching noise was the rock crumbling into the sea one minute to go and hed be eleven thirty seconds twenty tennine maybe hed wake dudley up just to annoy him three twooneboomthe whole shack shivered and harry sat bolt upright staring at the door someone was outside knocking to come inchapter fourthe keeper of the keysboom they knocked again dudley jerked awake wheres the cannon he said stupidlythere was a crash behind them and uncle vernon came skidding into the room he was holding a rifle in his hands now they knew what had been in the long thin package he had brought with themwhos there he shouted i warn you im armedthere was a pause then Ã¢â‚¬â€œsmashthe door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floora giant of a man was standing in the doorway his face was almost completely hidden by a long shaggy mane of hair and a wild tangled beard but you could make out his eyes glinting like black beetles under all the hairthe giant squeezed his way into the hut stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling he bent down picked up the door and fitted it easily back into its frame the noise of the storm outside dropped a little he turned to look at them allcouldnt make us a cup o tea could yeh its not been an easy journeyhe strode over to the sofa where dudley sat frozen with fearbudge up yeh great lump said the strangerdudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother who was crouching terrified behind uncle vernonan heres harry said the giantharry looked up into the fierce wild shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smilelas time i saw you you was only a baby said the giant yeh look a lot like yet dad but yehve got yet moms eyesuncle vernon made a funny rasping noisei demand that you leave at once sit he said you are breaking and enteringah shut up dursley yeh great prune said the giant he reached over the back of the sofa jerked the gun out of uncle vernons hands bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber and threw it into a corner of the roomuncle vernon made another funny noise like a mouse being trodden onanyway harry said the giant turning his back on the dursleys a very happy birthday to yeh got summat fer yeh here i mighta sat on it at some point but itll taste all rightfrom an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed box harry opened it with trembling fingers inside was a large sticky chocolate cake with happy birthday harry written on it in green icingharry looked up at the giant he meant to say thank you but the words got lost on the way to his mouth and what he said instead was who are youthe giant chuckledtrue i havent introduced meself rubeus hagrid keeper of keys and grounds at hogwartshe held out an enormous hand and shook harrys whole armwhat about that tea then eh he said rubbing his hands togetherid not say no ter summat stronger if yehve got it mindhis eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he snorted he bent down over the fireplace they couldnt see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later there was a roaring fire there it filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and harry felt the warmth wash over him as though hed sunk into a hot baththe giant sat back down on the sofa which sagged under his weight and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat a copper kettle a squashy package of sausages a poker a teapot several chipped mugs and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage nobody said a thing while the giant was working but as he slid the first six fat juicy slightly burnt sausages from the poker dudley fidgeted a little uncle vernon said sharply dont touch anything he gives you dudleythe giant chuckled darklyyet great puddin of a son don need fattenin anymore dursley don worryhe passed the sausages to harry who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful but he still couldnt take his eyes off the giant finally as nobody seemed about to explain anything he said im sorry but i still dont really know who you arethe giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his handcall me hagrid he said everyone does an like i told yeh im keeper of keys at hogwarts yehll know all about hogwarts o courseer no said harryhagrid looked shockedsorry harry said quicklysony barked

after a few minutes he stammered what does it mean they await my owlgallopin gorgons that reminds me said hagrid clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl a real live rather ruffledlooking owl a long quill and a roll of parchmentwith his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that harry could read upside down dear professor dumbledore given harry his lettertaking him to buy his things tomorrowweathers horrible hope youre wellhagrid hagrid rolled up the note gave it to the owl which clamped it in its beak went to the door and threw the owl out into the storm then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephoneharry realized his mouth was open and closed

an james potter its an outrage a scandal harry potter not knowin his own story when every kid in our world knows his name but why what happened harry asked urgentlythe anger faded from hagrids face he

some o the best witches an wizards of the age the mckinnons the bones the prewetts an you was only a baby an you livedsomething very painful was going on in harrys mind as hagrids story came to a close he saw again the blinding flash of green light more clearly than he had ever remembered it before and he remembered something else for the first time in his life a high cold cruel laughhagrid was watching him sadlytook yeh from the ruined house myself on dumbledores orders brought yeh ter this lotload of old tosh said uncle vernon harry jumped he had almost forgotten that the dursleys were there uncle vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage he was glaring at hagrid and his fists were clenchednow you listen here boy he snarled i accept theres something strange about you probably nothing a good beating wouldnt have cured and as for all this about your parents well they were weirdos no denying it and the worlds better off without them in my opinion asked for all they got getting mixed up with these wizarding types just what i expected always knew theyd come to a sticky end but at that moment hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat pointing this at uncle vernon like a sword he said im warning you dursley im warning you one more word Ã¢â‚¬Å“in danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant uncle vernons courage failed again he flattened himself against the wall and fell silentthats better said hagrid breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa which this time sagged right down to the floorharry meanwhile still had questions to ask hundreds of thembut what happened to vol sorry i mean youknowwhogood question harry disappeared vanished same night he tried ter kill you makes yeh even more famous thats the biggest mystry seehe was gettin more an more powerful whyd he go some say he died codswallop in my opinion dunno if he had enough human left in him to die some say hes still out there bidin his time like but i don believe it people who was on his side came back ter ours some of em came outta kinda trances don reckon they couldve done if he was comin backmost of us reckon hes still out there somewhere but lost his powerstoo weak to carry on cause somethin about you finished him harrythere was somethin goin on that night he hadnt counted on i dunno what it was no one does but somethin about you stumped him all righthagrid looked at harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes but harry instead of feeling pleased and proud felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake a wizard him how could he possibly be hed spent his life being clouted by dudley and bullied by aunt petunia and uncle vernon if he was really a wizard why hadnt they been turned into warty toads every time theyd tried to lock him in his cupboard if hed once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world how come dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football hagrid he said quietly i think you must have made a mistake i dont think i can be a wizardto his surprise hagrid chucklednot a wizard eh never made things happen when you was scared or angryharry looked into the fire now he came to think about it every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he harry had been upset or angry chased by dudleys gang he had somehow found himself out of their reach dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut hed managed to make it grow back and the very last time dudley had hit him hadnt he got his revenge without even realizing he was doing it hadnt he set a boa constrictor on him harry looked back at hagrid smiling and saw that hagrid was positively beaming at himsee said hagrid harry potter not a wizard you wait youll be right famous at hogwartsbut uncle vernon wasnt going to give in without a fighthavent i told you hes not going he hissed hes going to stonewall high and hell be grateful for it ive read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish spell books and wands and if he wants ter go a great muggle like you wont stop him growled hagrid stop lily an james potter s son goin ter hogwarts yer madhis

change an hell be under the greatest headmaster hogwarts ever had albus dumbledi am not paying for some crackpot old fool to teach him magic tricksyelled uncle vernonbut he had finally gone too far hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it over his head never he thundered insult albus dumbledorein front of mehe brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at dudley there was a flash of violet light a sound like a firecracker a sharp squeal and the next second dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom howling in pain when he turned his back on them harry saw a curly pigs tail poking through a hole in his trousersuncle vernon roared pulling aunt petunia and dudley into the other room he cast one last terrified look at hagrid and slammed the door behind themhagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beardshouldnta lost me temper he said ruefully but it didnt work anyway meant ter turn him into a pig but i suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there wasnt much left ter dohe cast a sideways look at harry under his bushy eyebrowsbe grateful if yeh didnt mention that ter anyone at hogwarts he said im er not supposed ter do

right harry mumbled im getting uphe sat up and hagrids heavy coat fell off him the hut was full of sunlight the storm was over hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window a newspaper held in its beakharry scrambled to his feet so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him he went straight to the window and jerked it open the owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of hagrid who didnt wake up the owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack hagrids coatdont do thatharry tried to wave the owl out of the way but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coathagrid said harry loudly theres an owl pay him hagrid grunted into the sofawhathe wants payin fer deliverin the paper look in the pocketshagrids coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets bunches of keys slug pellets balls of string peppermint humbugs teabagsfinally harry pulled out a handful of strangelooking coinsgive him five knuts said hagrid sleepilyknutsthe little bronze onesharry counted out five little bronze coins and the owl held out his leg so harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it then he flew off through the open windowhagrid yawned loudly sat up and stretchedbest be off harry lots ter do today gotta get up ter london an buy all yer stuff fer schoolharry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them he had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had got a punctureum hagridmm said hagrid who was pulling on his huge bootsi havent got any money and you heard uncle vernon last night he wont pay for me to go and learn magicdont worry about that said hagrid standing up and scratching his head dyeh think yer

thenharry followed hagrid out onto the rock the sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight the boat uncle vernon had hired was still there with a lot of water in the bottom after the stormhow did you get here harry asked looking around for another boatflew said hagridflewyeah but well go back in this not spposed ter use magic now ive got yehthey settled down in the boat harry still staring at hagrid trying to imagine him flyingseems a shame ter row though said hagrid giving harry another of his sideways looks if i was ter er speed things up a bit would yeh mind not mentionin it at hogwartsof course not said harry eager to see more magic hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again tapped it twice on the side of the boat and they sped off toward landwhy would you be

gringotts is hundreds of miles under london see deep under the underground yehd die of hunger tryin ter get out even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summatharry sat and thought about this while hagrid read his newspaper the daily prophet harry had learned from uncle vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this but it was very difficult hed never had so many questions in his lifeministry o magic messin things up as usual hagrid muttered turning the pagetheres a ministry of magic harry asked before he could stop himselfcourse said hagrid they wanted dumbledore fer minister course but hed never leave hogwarts so old cornelius fudge got the job bungler if ever there was one so he pelts dumbledore with owls every morning askin fer advicebut what does a ministry of magic dowell their main job is to keep it from the muggles that theres still witches an wizards up an down the countrywhywhy blimey harry everyoned be wantin magic solutions to their problems nah were best left aloneat this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall hagrid folded up his newspaper and they clambered up the stone steps onto the streetpassersby stared a lot at hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station harry couldnt blame them not only was hagrid twice as tall as anyone else he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly see that harry things these muggles dream up ehhagrid said harry panting a bit as he ran to keep up did you say there are dragons at gringottswell so they say said hagrid crikey id like a dragonyoud like onewanted one ever since i was a kid here we gothey had reached the station there was a train to london in five minutes time hagrid who didnt understand muggle money as he called it gave the bills to harry so he could buy their ticketspeople stared more than ever on the train hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canaryyellow circus tentstill got yer letter harry he asked as he counted stitches harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocketgood said hagrid theres a list there of everything yeh needharry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadnt noticed the night before and read hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry uniform firstyear students will require three sets of plain work robes black one plain pointed hat black for day wear one pair of protective

years are not allowed their own broomsticks can we buy all this in london harry wondered aloudif yeh know where to go said hagridharry had never been to london before although hagrid seemed to know where he was going he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way he got stuck in the ticket barrier on the underground and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slowi dont know how the muggles manage without magic he said as they climbed a brokendown escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shopshagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily all harry had to do was keep close behind him they passed book shops and music stores hamburger restaurants and cinemas but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand this was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks might this not all be some huge joke that the dursleys had cooked up if harry hadnt known that the dursleys had no sense of humor he might have thought so yet somehow even though everything hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable harry couldnt help trusting himthis is it said hagrid coming to a halt the leaky cauldron its a famous placeit was a tiny grubbylooking pub if hagrid hadnt pointed it out harry wouldnt have noticed it was there the people hurrying by didnt glance at it their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldnt see the leaky cauldron at all in fact harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and hagrid could see it before he could mention this hagrid had steered him insidefor a famous place it was very dark and shabby a few old women were sitting in a corner drinking tiny glasses of sherry one of them was smoking a long pipe a little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut the low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in everyone seemed to know hagrid they waved and smiled at him and the bartender reached for a glass saying the usual hagridcant tom im on hogwarts business said hagrid clapping his great hand on harrys shoulder and making harrys knees bucklegood lord said the bartender peering at harry is this can this be the leaky cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silentbless my soul whispered the old bartender harry potter what an honorhe hurried out from behind the bar rushed toward harry and seized his hand tears in his eyeswelcome back mr potter welcome backharry didnt know what to say everyone was looking at him the old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone outhagrid was beamingthen there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the leaky cauldrondoris crockford mr potter cant believe im meeting you at lastso proud mr potter im just so proudalways wanted to shake your hand im all of a flutterdelighted mr potter just cant tell you diggles the name dedalus diggleive seen you before said harry as dedalus diggles top

crockford kept coming back for morea pale young man made his way forward very nervously one of his eyes was twitchingprofessor quirrell said hagrid harry professor quirrell will be one of your teachers at hogwartspppotter stammered professor quirrell grasping harrys hand ccant ttell you how p pleased i am to meet youwhat sort of magic do you teach professor quirrellddefense against the

last hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babblemust get on lots ter buy come on harrydoris crockford shook harrys hand one last time and hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small walled courtyard where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weedshagrid grinned at harrytold yeh didnt i told yeh you was famous even professor quirrell was tremblin ter meet yeh mind you hes usually tremblinis he always that nervousoh yeah poor bloke brilliant mind he was fine while he was studyin outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience they say he met vampires in the black forest and there was a nasty bit o trouble with a hag never been the same sincescared of the students scared of his own subject now wheres me umbrellavampires hags harrys head was swimming hagrid meanwhile was counting bricks in the wall above the trash canthree up two across he muttered right stand back harryhe tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrellathe brick he had touched quivered it wriggled in the middle a small hole appeared it grew wider and wider a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for hagrid an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sightwelcome said hagrid to diagon alleyhe grinned at harrys amazement they stepped through the archway harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wallthe sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shopcauldrons all sizes copper brass pewter silver selfstirring collapsible said a sign hanging over themyeah youll be needin one said hagrid but we gotta get yer money firstharry wished he had about eight more eyes he turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street trying to look at everything at once the shops the things outside them the people doing their shopping a plump woman outside an apothecary was shaking her head as they passed saying dragon liver seventeen sickles an ounce theyre mada low soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying eeylops owl emporium tawny screech barn brown and snowy several boys of about harrys age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it look harry heard one of them say the new nimbus two thousand fastest ever there were shops selling robes shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments harry had never seen before windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels eyes tottering piles of spell books quills and rolls of parchment potion bottles globes of the moongringotts said hagridthey had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops standing beside its burnished bronze doors wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold was yeah thats a goblin said hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him the goblin was about a head shorter than harryhe had a swarthy clever face a pointed beard and harry noticed very long fingers and feet he bowed as they walked inside now they were facing a second pair of doors silver this time with words engraved upon them enter stranger but take heed of what awaits the sin of greed for those who take but do not earn must pay most dearly in their turnso if you seek beneath our floors a treasure that was never yours thief you have been warned beware of finding more than treasure therelike i said yehd be mad ter try an rob it said hagrida pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall about a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter scribbling in large ledgers weighing coins in brass scales examining precious stones through eyeglassesthere were too many doors to count leading off the hall and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these hagrid and harry made for the countermorning said hagrid to a free goblin weve come ter take some money outta mr harry potters safeyou have his key sirgot it here somewhere said hagrid and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblins book of numbers the goblin wrinkled his nose harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coalsgot it said hagrid at last holding up a tiny golden keythe goblin looked at it closelythat seems to be in orderan ive also got a letter here from professor dumbledore said hagrid importantly throwing out his chest its about the youknowwhat in vault seven hundred and thirteenthe goblin read the letter carefullyvery well he said handing it back to hagrid i will have someone take you down to both vaults griphookgriphook was yet another goblin once hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets he and harry followed griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hallwhats the youknowwhat in vault seven hundred and thirteen harry askedcant tell yeh that said hagrid mysteriously very secret hogwarts business dumbledores trusted me moren my jobs worth ter tell yeh thatgriphook held the door open for them harry who had expected more marble was surprised they were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches it sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them they climbed in hagrid with some difficulty and were offat first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages harry tried to remember left right right left middle fork right left but it was impossible the rattling cart seemed to know its own way because griphook wasnt steeringharrys eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them but he kept them wide open once he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon but too late they plunged even deeper passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floori never know harry called to hagrid over the noise of the cart whats the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactitestalagmites got an m in it said hagrid an don ask me questions just now i think im gonna be sickhe did look very green and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from tremblinggriphook unlocked the door a lot of green smoke came billowing out and as it cleared harry gasped inside were mounds of gold coins columns of silver heaps of little bronze knutsall yours smiled hagridall harrys it was incredible the dursleys couldnt have known about this or theyd have had it from him faster than blinking how often had they complained how much harry cost them to keep and all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him buried deep under londonhagrid helped harry pile some of it into a bagthe gold ones are galleons he explained seventeen silver sickles to a galleon and twentynine knuts to a sickle its easy enough right that should be enough fer a couple o terms well keep the rest safe for yeh he turned to griphook vault seven hundred and thirteen now please and can we go more slowlyone speed only said griphookthey were going even deeper now and gathering speed the air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners they went rattling over an underground ravine and harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom but hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neckvault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyholestand back said griphook importantly he stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted awayif anyone but a gringotts goblin tried that theyd be sucked through the door and trapped in there said griphookhow often do you check to see if anyones inside harry askedabout once every ten years said griphook with a rather nasty grinsomething really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault harry was sure and he leaned forward eagerly expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least but at first he thought it was empty then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat harry longed to know what it was but knew better than to askcome on back in this infernal cart and dont talk to me on the way back its best if i keep me mouth shut said hagridone wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside gringotts harry didnt know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money he didnt have to know how many galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than hed had in his whole life more money than even dudley had ever hadmight as well get yer uniform said hagrid nodding toward madam malkins robes for all occasions listen harry would yeh mind if i slipped off fer a pickmeup in the leaky cauldron i hate them gringotts carts he did still look a bit sick so harry entered madam malkins shop alone feeling nervousmadam malkin was a squat smiling witch dressed all in mauvehogwarts clear she said when harry started to speak got the lot here another young man being fitted up just now in fact Ã¢â‚¬Å“in the back of the shop a boy with a pale pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes madam malkin stood harry on a stool next to him slipped a long robe over his head and began to pin it to the right lengthhello said the boy hogwarts tooyes said harrymy fathers next door buying my books and mothers up the street looking at wands said the boy he had a bored drawling voice then im going to drag them off to took at racing brooms i dont see why first years cant have their own i think ill bully father into getting me one and ill smuggle it in somehowharry was strongly reminded of dudleyhave you got your own broom the boy went onno said harryplay quidditch at allno harry said again wondering what on earth quidditch could bei do father says its a crime if im not picked to play for my house and i must say i agree know what house youll be in yetno said harry feeling more stupid by the minutewell no one really knows until they get there do they but i know ill be in slytherin all our family have been imagine being in hufflepuff i think id leave wouldnt you mmm said harry wishing he could say something a bit more interestingi say look at that man said the boy suddenly nodding toward the front window hagrid was standing there grinning at harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldnt come inthats hagrid said harry pleased to know something the boy didnthe works at hogwartsoh said the boy ive heard of him hes a sort of servant isnt hehes the gamekeeper said harry he was liking the boy less and less every secondyes exactly i heard hes a sort of savage lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk tries to do magic and ends up setting fire to his bedi think hes brilliant said harry coldlydo you said the boy with a slight sneer why is he with you where are your parentstheyre dead said harry shortly he didnt feel much like going into the matter with this boyoh sorry said the other not sounding sorry at all but they were our kind werent theythey were a witch and wizard if thats what you meani really dont think they should let the other sort in do you theyre just not the same theyve never been brought up to know our ways some of them have never even heard of hogwarts until they get the letter imagine i think they should keep it in the old wizarding familieswhats your surname anywaybut before harry could answer madam malkin said thats you done my dear and harry not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy hopped down from the footstoolwell ill see you at hogwarts i suppose said the drawling boyharry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream hagrid had bought him chocolate and raspberry with chopped nutswhats up said hagridnothing harry lied they stopped to buy parchment and quills harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote when they had left the shop he said hagrid whats quidditchblimey harry i keep forgettin how little yeh know not knowin about quidditchdont make me feel worse said harry he told hagrid about the pate boy in madam malkinsand he said people from muggle families shouldnt even be allowed inyer not from a muggle family if hed known who yeh were hes grown up knowin yer name if his parents are wizardin folk you saw what everyone in the leaky cauldron was like when they saw yeh anyway what does he know about it some o the best i ever saw were the only ones with magic in em in a long line muggles look at yer mum look what she had fer a sisterso what is quidditchits our sport wizard sport its like like soccer in the muggle world everyone follows quidditch played up in the air on broomsticks and theres four balls sorta hard ter explain the rulesand what are slytherin and hufflepuffschool houses theres four everyone says hufflepuff are a lot o duffers but i bet im in hufflepuff said harry gloomilybetter hufflepuff than slytherin said hagrid darkly theres not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasnt in slytherinyouknowwho was onevol sorry youknowwho was at hogwartsyears an years ago said hagridthey bought harrys school books in a shop called flourish and blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all even dudley who never read anything would have been wild to get his hands on some of these hagrid almost had to drag harry away from curses and countercurses bewitch your friends and befuddle your enemies with the latest revenges hair loss jellylegs tongue tying and much much more by professor vindictus viridiani was trying to find out how to curse dudleyim not sayin thats not a good idea but yer not ter use magic in the muggle world except in very special circumstances said hagrid an anyway yeh couldn work any of them curses yet yehll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that levelhagrid wouldnt let harry buy a solid gold cauldron either it says pewter on yer list but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope then they visited the apothecary which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor jars of herbs dried roots and bright powders lined the walls bundles of feathers strings of fangs and snarled claws hung from the ceiling while hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for harry harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twentyone galleons each and minuscule glitteryblack beetle eyes five knuts a scoopoutside the apothecary hagrid checked harrys list againjust yer wand left a yeah an i still havent got yeh a birthday presentharry felt himself go redyou dont have to i know i dont have to tell yeh what ill get yer animal not a toad toads went outta fashion years ago yehd be laughed at an i don like cats they make me sneeze ill get yer an owl all the kids want owls theyre dead useful carry yer mail an everythintwenty minutes later they left eeylops owl emporium which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering jewelbright eyes harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl fast asleep with her head under her wing he couldnt stop stammering his thanks sounding just like professor quirrelldon mention it said hagrid gruffly don expect youve had a lotta presents from them dursleys just ollivanders left now only place fer wands ollivanders and yeh gotta have the best wanda magic wand this was what harry had been really looking forward tothe last shop was narrow and shabby peeling gold letters over the door read ollivanders makers of fine wands since bc a single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty windowa tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside it was a tiny place empty except for a single spindly chair that hagrid sat on to wait harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling for some reason the back of his neck prickled the very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magicgood afternoon said a soft voice harry jumped hagrid must have jumped too because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chairan old man was standing before them his wide pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shophello said harry awkwardlyah yes said the man yes yes i thought id be seeing you soonharry potter it wasnt a question you have your mothers eyes it seems only yesterday she was in here herself buying her first wand ten and a quarter inches long swishy made of willow nice wand for charm workmr ollivander moved closer to harry harry wished he would blink those silvery eyes were a bit creepyyour father on the other hand favored a mahogany wand eleven inchespliable a little more power and excellent for transfiguration well i say your father favored it its really the wand that chooses the wizard of coursemr ollivander had come so close that he and harry were almost nose to nose harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyesand thats wheremr ollivander touched the lightning scar on harrys forehead with a long white fingerim sorry to say i sold the wand that did it he said softlythirteenandahalf inches yew powerful wand very powerful and in the wrong hands well if id known what that wand was going out into the world to dohe shook his head and then to harrys relief spotted hagridrubeus rubeus hagrid how nice to see you again oak sixteen inches rather bendy wasnt itit was sir yes said hagridgood wand that one but i suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled said mr ollivander suddenly sterner yes they did yes said hagrid shuffling his feet ive still got the pieces though he added brightlybut you dont use them said mr ollivander sharplyoh no sit said hagrid quickly harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spokehmmm said mr ollivander giving hagrid a piercing look well now mr potter let me see he pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket which is your wand armer well im righthanded said harryhold out your arm thats it he measured harry from shoulder to finger then wrist to elbow shoulder to floor knee to armpit and round his head as he measured he said every ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance mr potter we use unicorn hairs phoenix tail feathers and the heartstrings of dragons no two ollivander wands are the same just as no two unicorns dragons or phoenixes are quite the same and of course you will never get such good results with another wizards wandharry suddenly realized that the tape measure which was measuring between his nostrils was doing this on its own mr ollivander was flitting around the shelves taking down boxesthat will do he said and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor right then mr potter try this one beechwood and dragon heartstring nine inches nice and flexible just take it and give it a waveharry took the wand and feeling foolish waved it around a bit but mr ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at oncemaple and phoenix feather

inches nice and suppleharry took the wand he felt a sudden warmth in his fingers he raised the wand above his head brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls hagrid whooped and clapped and mr ollivander cried oh bravo yes indeed oh very good well well well how curious how very curious Ã¢â‚¬Å“he put harrys wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper still muttering curious curioussorry said harry but whats curiousmr ollivander fixed harry with his pale starei

remember i think we must expect great things from you mr potter after all he whomustnotbenamed did great things terrible yes but greatharry shivered he wasnt sure he liked mr ollivander too much he paid seven gold galleons for his wand and mr ollivander bowed them from his shopthe late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as harry and hagrid made their way back down diagon alley back through the wall back through the leaky cauldron now empty harry didnt speak at all as they walked down the road he didnt even notice how much people were gawking at them on the underground laden as they were with all their funnyshaped packages with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on harrys lap up another escalator out into paddington station harry only realized where they were when hagrid tapped him on the shouldergot time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves he saidhe bought harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them harry kept looking around everything looked so strange somehowyou all right harry yer very quiet said hagridharry wasnt sure he could explain hed just had the best birthday of his life and yet he chewed his hamburger trying to find the wordseveryone

cant even remember what im famous for i dont know what happened when vol sorry i mean the night my parents diedhagrid leaned across the table behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smiledon you worry harry youll learn fast enough everyone starts at the beginning at hogwarts youll be just fine just be yerself i know its hard yehve been singled out an thats always hard but yehll have a great time at hogwarts i did still do smatter of facthagrid helped harry on to the train that would take him back to the dursleys then handed him an envelopeyer ticket fer hogwarts he said first o september kings cross its all on yer ticket any problems with the dursleys send me a letter with yer owl shell know where to find me see yeh soon harrythe train pulled out of the station harry wanted to watch hagrid until he was out of sight he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window but he blinked and hagrid had gonechapter sixthe journey from platform nine and threequartersharrys last month with the dursleys wasnt fun true dudley was now so scared of harry he wouldnt stay in the same room while aunt petunia and uncle vernon didnt shut harry in his cupboard force him to do anything or shout at him in fact they didnt speak to him at allhalf terrified half furious they acted as though any chair with harry in it were empty although this was an improvement in many ways it did become a bit depressing after a whileharry kept to his room with his new owl for company he had decided to call her hedwig a name he had found in a history of magic his school books were very interesting he lay on his bed reading late into the night hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased it was lucky that aunt petunia didnt come in to vacuum anymore because hedwig kept bringing back dead mice every night before he went to sleep harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall counting down to september the firston the last day of august he thought hed better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to kings cross station the next day so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television he cleared his throat to let them know he was there and dudley screamed and ran from the roomer uncle vernonuncle vernon grunted to show he was listeninger i need to be at kings cross tomorrow to to go to hogwartsuncle vernon grunted againwould it be all right if you gave me a liftgrunt harry supposed that meant yesthank youhe was about to go back upstairs when uncle vernon actually spokefunny way to get to a wizards school the train magic carpets all got punctures have theyharry didnt say anythingwhere is this school anywayi dont know said harry realizing this for the first time he pulled the ticket hagrid had given him out of his pocketi just take the train from platform nine and threequarters at eleven oclock he readhis aunt and uncle staredplatform whatnine and threequartersdont talk rubbish said uncle vernon there is no platform nine and threequartersits on my ticketbarking said uncle vernon howling mad the lot of them youll seeyou just wait all right well take you to kings cross were going up to london tomorrow anyway or i wouldnt botherwhy are you going to london harry asked trying to keep things friendlytaking dudley to the hospital growled uncle vernon got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to smeltingsharry woke at five oclock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep he got up and pulled on his jeans because he didnt want to walk into the station in his wizards robes hed change on the train he checked his hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed saw that hedwig was shut safely in her cage and then paced the room waiting for the dursleys to get up two hours later harrys huge heavy trunk had been loaded into the dursleys car aunt petunia had talked dudley into sitting next to harry and they had set offthey reached kings cross at half past ten uncle vernon dumped harrys trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him harry thought this was strangely kind until uncle vernon stopped dead facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his facewell there you are boy platform nine platform ten your platform should be somewhere in the middle but they dont seem to have built it yet do theyhe was quite right of course there was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it and in the middle nothing at allhave a good term said uncle vernon with an even nastier smile he left without another word harry turned and saw the dursleys drive awayall three of them were laughing harrys mouth went rather dry what on earth was he going to do he was starting to attract a lot of funny looks because of hedwig hed have to ask someonehe stopped a passing guard but didnt dare mention platform nine and threequarters the guard had never heard of hogwarts and when harry couldnt even tell him what part of the country it was in he started to get annoyed as though harry was being stupid on purpose getting desperate harry asked for the train that left at eleven oclock but the guard said there wasnt one in the end the guard strode away muttering about time wasters harry was now trying hard not to panicaccording to the large clock over the arrivals board he had ten minutes left to get on the train to hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift a pocket full of wizard money and a large owlhagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do like tapping the third brick on the left to get into diagon alley he wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspectors stand between platforms nine and tenat that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were sayingpacked with muggles of course harry swung round the speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys all with flaming red hair each of them was pushing a trunk like harrys in front of him and they had an owlheart hammering harry pushed his cart after them they stopped and so did he just near enough to hear what they were sayingnow whats the platform number said the boys mothernine and threequarters piped a small girl also redheaded who was holding her hand mom cant i go Ã¢â‚¬Å“youre not old enough ginny now be quiet all right percy you go firstwhat looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and tenharry watched careful not to blink in case he missed it but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away the boy had vanishedfred you next the plump woman saidim not fred im george said the boy honestly woman you call yourself our mother cara you tell im georgesorry george dearonly joking i am fred said the boy and off he went his twin called after him to hurry up and he must have done so because a second later he had gone but how had he done it now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was almost there and then quite suddenly he wasnt anywherethere was nothing else for itexcuse me harry said to the plump womanhello dear she said first time at hogwarts rons new tooshe pointed at the last and youngest of her sons he was tall thin and gangling with freckles big hands and feet and a long noseyes said harry the thing is the thing is i dont know how to how to get onto the platform she said kindly and harry noddednot to worry she said all you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten dont stop and dont be scared youll crash into it thats very important best do it at a bit of a run if youre nervous go on go now before roner okay said harryhe pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier it looked very solidhe started to walk toward it people jostled him on their way to platforms nine and ten harry walked more quickly he was going to smash right into that barrier and then hed be in trouble leaning forward on his cart he broke into a heavy run the barrier was coming nearer and nearer he wouldnt be able to stop the cart was out of control he was a foot away he closed his eyes ready for the crash it didnt come he kept on running he opened his eyes a scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people a sign overhead said hogwarts express eleven oclock harry looked behind him and saw a wroughtiron archway where the barrier had been with the words platform nine and threequarters on it he had done itsmoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunksthe first few carriages were already packed with students some hanging out of the window to talk to their families some fighting over seatsharry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seathe passed a roundfaced boy who was saying gran ive lost my toad againoh neville he heard the old woman sigha boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowdgive us a look lee go onthe boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long hairy legharry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train he put hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door he tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his footwant a hand it was one of the redhaired twins hed followed through the barrieryes please harry pantedoy fred cmere and helpwith the twins

saw the boys mother waving and their sister half laughing half crying running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed then she fell back and wavedharry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner houses flashed past the window harry felt a great leap of excitement he didnt know what he was going to but it had to be better than what he was leaving behindthe door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came inanyone sitting there he asked pointing at the seat opposite harryeverywhere else is fullharry shook his head and the boy sat down he glanced at harry and then looked quickly out of the window pretending he hadnt looked harry saw he still had a black mark on his nosehey ronthe twins were backlisten were going

doing he looked quickly out of the window againare all your family wizards asked harry who found ron just as interesting as ron found himer yes i think so said ron i think moms got a second cousin whos an accountant but we never talk about himso you must know loads of magic alreadythe weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in diagon alley had talked abouti heard

rat which was asleephis names scabbers and hes useless he hardly ever wakes up percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect but they couldnt aff i mean i got scabbers insteadrons ears went pink he seemed to think hed said too much because he went back to staring out of the windowharry didnt think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl after all hed never had any money in his life until a month ago and he told ron so all about having to wear dudleys old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents this seemed to cheer ron upand until hagrid told me i didnt know anything about be ing a wizard or about my parents or voldemortron gaspedwhat said harryyou said youknowwhos name said ron sounding both shocked and impressed id have thought you of all people im not trying to be brave or anything saying the name said harry i just never knew you shouldnt see what i mean ive got loads to learn i bet he added voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot lately i bet im the worst in the classyou wont be theres loads of people who come from muggle families and they learn quick enoughwhile they had been talking the train had carried them out of londonnow they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep they were quiet for a time watching the fields and lanes flick pastaround half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling dimpled woman slid back their door and said anything off the cart dearsharry who hadnt had any breakfast leapt to his feet but rons ears went pink again and he muttered that hed brought sandwiches harry went out into the corridorhe had never had any money for candy with the dursleys and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many mars bars as he could carry but the woman didnt have mars bars what she did have were bettie botts every flavor beans droobles best blowing gum chocolate frogs pumpkin pasties cauldron cakes licorice wands and a number of other strange things harry had never seen in his life not wanting to miss anything he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver sickles and seven bronze knutsron stared as harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seathungry are youstarving said harry taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pastyron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it there were four sandwiches inside he pulled one of them apart and said she always forgets i dont like corned beefswap you for one of these said harry holding up a pasty go on you dont want this its all dry said ron she hasnt got much time he added quickly you know with five of usgo on have a pasty said harry who had never had anything to share before or indeed anyone to share it with it was a nice feeling sitting there with ron eating their way through all harrys pasties cakes and candies the sandwiches lay forgottenwhat are these harry asked ron holding up a pack of chocolate frogstheyre not really frogs are they he was starting to feel that nothing would surprise himno said ron but see what the card is im missing agrippawhatoh of course you wouldnt know chocolate frogs have cards inside them you know to collect famous witches and wizards ive got about five hundred but i havent got agrippa or ptolemyharry unwrapped his chocolate frog and picked up the card it showed a mans face he wore half moon glasses had a long crooked nose and flowing silver hair beard and mustache underneath the picture was the name albus dumbledoreso this is dumbledore said harrydont tell me youd never heard of dumbledore said ron can i have a frog i might get agrippa thanks harry turned over his card and read albus dumbledore currently headmaster of hogwarts considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard grindelwald in for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragons blood and his work on alchemy with his partner nicolas flamel professor dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowlingharry turned the card back over and saw to his astonishment that dumbledores face had disappearedhes gonewell you cant expect him to hang around all day said ron hell be back no ive got morgana again and ive got about six of her do you want it you can start collectingrons eyes strayed to the pile of chocolate frogs waiting to be unwrappedhelp yourself said harry but in you know the muggle world people just stay put in photosdo they what they dont move at all ron sounded amazed weirdharry stared as dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the famous witches and wizards cards but harry couldnt keep his eyes off them soon he had not only dumbledore and morgana but hengist of woodcroft alberic grunnion circe paracelsus and merlinhe finally tore his eyes away from the druidess cliodna who was scratching her nose to open a bag of bertie botts every flavor beansyou want to be careful with those ron warned harry when they say every flavor they mean every flavor you know you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and mar malade but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe george reckons he had a boogerflavored one onceron picked up a green bean looked at it carefully and bit into a cornerbleaaargh see sproutsthey had a good time eating the every flavor beans harry got toast coconut baked bean strawberry curry grass coffee sardine and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one ron wouldnt touch which turned out to be pepperthe countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder the neat fields had gone now there were woods twisting rivers and dark green hillsthere was a knock on the door of their compartment and the roundfaced boy harry had passed on platform nine and threequarters came in he looked tearfulsorry he said but have you seen a toad at allwhen they shook their heads he wailed ive lost him he keeps getting away from mehell turn up said harryyes said the boy miserably well if you see himhe leftdont know why hes so bothered said ron if id brought a toad id lose it as quick as i could mind you i brought scabbers so i cant talkthe rat was still snoozing on rons laphe might have died and you wouldnt know the difference said ron in disgust i tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting but the spell didnt work ill show you lookhe rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very batteredlooking wand it was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the endunicorn hairs nearly poking out anyway he had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open againthe toadless boy was back but this time he had a girl with him she was already wearing her new hogwarts robeshas anyone seen a toad nevilles lost one she said she had a bossy sort of voice lots of bushy brown hair and rather large front teethweve already told him we havent seen it said ron but the girl wasnt listening she was looking at the wand in his handoh are you doing magic lets see it thenshe sat down ron looked taken abacker all righthe cleared his throatsunshine daisies butter mellow turn this stupid fat rat yellowhe waved his wand but nothing happened scabbers stayed gray and fast asleepare you sure thats a real spell said the girl well its not very good is it ive tried a few simple spells just for practice and its all worked for me nobody in my familys magic at all it was ever such a surprise when i got my letter but i was ever so pleased of course i mean its the very best school of witchcraft there is ive heard ive learned all our course books by heart of course i just hope it will be enough im hermione granger by the way who are youshe said all this very fastharry looked at ron and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadnt learned all the course books by heart eitherim ron weasley ron mutteredharry potter said harryare you really said hermione i know all about you of course i got a few extra books for background reading and youre in modern magical history and the rise and fall of the dark arts and great wizarding events of the twentieth centuryam i said harry feeling dazedgoodness didnt you know id have found out everything i could if it was me said hermione do either of you know what house youll be in ive been asking around and i hope im in gryffindor it sounds by far the best i hear dumbledore himself was in it but i suppose ravenclaw wouldnt be too bad anyway wed better go and look for nevilles toad you two had better change you know i expect well be there soonand she left taking the toadless boy with herwhatever house im in i hope shes not in it said ron he threw his wand back into his trunk stupid spell george gave it to me bet he knew it was a dudwhat house are your brothers in asked harrygryffindor said ron gloom seemed to be settling on him again mom and dad were in it too i dont know what theyll say if im not i dont suppose ravenclaw would be too bad but imagine if they put me in slytherinthats the house vol i mean youknowwho was inyeah said ron he flopped back into his seat looking depressedyou know i think the ends of scabbers whiskers are a bit lightersaid harry trying to take rons mind off houses so what do your oldest brothers do now that theyve left anywayharry was wondering what a wizard did once hed finished schoolcharlies in romania studying dragons and bills in africa doing something for gringotts said ron did you hear about gringotts its been all over the daily prophet but i dont suppose you get that with the muggles someone tried to rob a high security vaultharry staredreally what happened to themnothing thats why its such big news they havent been caught my dad says it mustve been a powerful dark wizard to get round gringotts but they dont think they took anything thats whats odd course everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case youknowwhos behind itharry turned this news over in his mind he was starting to get a prickle of fear every time you knowwho was mentioned he supposed this was all part of entering the magical world but it had been a lot more comfortable saying voldemort without worryingwhats your quidditch team ron askeder i dont know any harry confessedwhat ron looked dumbfounded oh you wait its the best game in the world and he was off explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players describing famous games hed been to with his brothers and the broomstick hed like to get if he had the money he was just taking harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again but it wasnt neville the toadless boy or hermione granger this timethree boys entered and harry recognized the middle one at once it was the pale boy from madam malkins robe shop he was looking at harry with a lot more interest than hed shown back in diagon alleyis it true he said theyre saying all down the train that harry potters in this compartment so its you is ityes said harry he was looking at the other boys both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean standing on either side of the pale boy they looked like bodyguardsoh this is crabbe and this is goyle said the pale boy carelessly noticing where harry was looking and my names malfoy draco malfoyron gave a slight cough which might have been hiding a snigget draco malfoy looked at himthink my names funny do you no need to ask who you are my father told me all the weasleys have red hair freckles and more children than they can affordhe turned back to harry youll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others potter you dont want to go making friends with the wrong sort i can help you therehe held out his hand to shake harrys but harry didnt take iti think i can tell who the wrong sort are for myself thanks he said coollydraco malfoy didnt go red but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeksid be careful if i were you potter he said slowly unless youre a bit politer youll go the same way as your parents they didnt know what was good for them either you hang around with riffraff like the weasleys and that hagrid and itll rub off on youboth harry and ron stood upsay that again ron said his face as red as his hairoh youre going to fight us are you malfoy sneeredunless you get out now said harry more bravely than he felt because crabbe and goyle were a lot bigger than him or ronbut we dont feet like leaving do we boys weve eaten all our food and you still seem to have somegoyle reached toward the chocolate frogs next to ron ron leapt forward but before hed so much as touched goyle goyle let out a horrible yellscabbers the rat was hanging off his finger sharp little teeth sunk deep into goyles knuckle crabbe and malfoy backed away as goyle swung scabbers round and round howling and when scabbets finally flew off and hit the window all three of them disappeared at once perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets or perhaps theyd heard footsteps because a second later hermione granger had come inwhat has been going on she said looking at the sweets all over the floor and ron picking up scabbers by his taili think hes been knocked out ron said to harry he looked closer at scabbers no i dont believe it hes gone back to sleepand so he hadyouve met malfoy beforeharry explained about their meeting in diagon alleyive heard of his family said ron darkly they were some of the first to come back to our side after youknowwho disappeared said theyd been bewitched my dad doesnt believe it he says malfoys father didnt need an excuse to go over to the dark side he turned to hermione can we help you with somethingyoud better hurry up and put your robes on ive just been up to the front to ask the conductor and he says were nearly there you havent been fighting have you youll be in trouble before we even get therescabbers has been fighting not us said ron scowling at her would you mind leaving while we changeall right i only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly racing up and down the corridors said hermione in a sniffy voice and youve got dirt on your nose by the way did you knowron glared at her as she left harry peered out of the window it was getting dark he could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky the train did seem to be slowing downhe and ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robesrons were a bit short for him you could see his sneakers underneath thema voice echoed through the train we will be reaching hogwarts in five minutes time please leave your luggage on the train it will be taken to the school separatelyharrys stomach lurched with nerves and ron he saw looked pale under his freckles they crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridorthe train slowed right down and finally stopped people pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny dark platform harry shivered in the cold night air then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students and harry heard a familiar voice firs years firs years over here all right there harryhagrids big hairy face beamed over the sea of headscmon follow me any more firs years mind yer step now firs years follow meslipping and stumbling they followed hagrid down what seemed to be a steep narrow path it was so dark on either side of them that harry thought there must be thick trees there nobody spoke much neville the boy who kept losing his toad sniffed once or twiceye all get yer firs sight o hogwarts in a sec hagrid called over his shoulder jus round this bend herethere was a loud ooooohthe narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black takeperched atop a high mountain on the other side its windows sparkling in the starry sky was a vast castle with many turrets and towersno moren four to a boat hagrid called pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore harry and ron were followed into their boat by neville and hermione everyone in shouted hagrid who had a boat to himself right then forwardand the fleet of little boats moved off all at once gliding across the lake which was as smooth as glass everyone was silent staring up at the great castle overhead it towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stoodheads down yelled hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face they were carried along a dark tunnel which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle until they reached a kind of underground harbor where they clambered out onto rocks and pebblesoy you there is this your toad said hagrid who was checking the boats as people climbed out of themtrevor cried neville blissfully holding out his hands then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after hagrids lamp coming out at last onto smooth damp grass right in the shadow of the castlethey walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge oak front dooreveryone here you there still got yer toadhagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle doorchapter seventhe sorting hatthe door swung open at once a tall blackhaired witch in emeraldgreen robes stood there she had a very stern face and harrys first thought was that this was not someone to crossthe firs years professor mcgonagall said hagridthank you hagrid i will take them from hereshe pulled the door wide the entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the dursleys house in it the stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at gringotts the ceiling was too high to make out and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floorsthey followed professor mcgonagall across the flagged stone floor harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right the rest of the school must already be here but professor mcgonagall showed the first years into a small empty chamber off the hall they crowded in standing rather closer together than they would usually have done peering about nervouslywelcome to hogwarts said professor mcgonagall the startofterm banquet will begin shortly but before you take your seats in the great hall you will be sorted into your houses the sorting is a very important ceremony because while you are here your house will be something like your family within hogwarts you will have classes with the rest of your house sleep in your house dormitory and spend free time in your house common roomthe four houses are called gryffindor hufflepuff ravenclaw and slytherin each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards while you are at hogwarts your triumphs will earn your house points while any rulebreaking will lose house points at the end of the year the house with the most points is awarded the house cup a great honor i hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yoursthe sorting ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school i suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waitingher eyes lingered for a moment on nevilles cloak which was fastened under his left ear and on rons smudged nose harry nervously tried to flatten his hairi shall return when we are ready for you said professor mcgonagallplease wait quietlyshe left the chamber harry swallowedhow exactly do they sort us into houses he asked ronsome sort of test i think fred said it hurts a lot but i think he was jokingharrys heart gave a horrible jolt a test in front of the whole school but he didnt know any magic yet what on earth would he have to do he hadnt expected something like this the moment they arrivedhe looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified too no one was talking much except hermione granger who was whispering very fast about all the spells shed learned and wondering which one shed need harry tried hard not to listen to her hed never been more nervous never not even when hed had to take a school report home to the dursleys saying that hed somehow turned his teachers wig blue he kept his eyes fixed on the door any second now professor mcgonagall would come back and lead him to his doomthen something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air several people behind him screamedwhat the he gasped so did the people around him about twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall pearlywhite and slightly transparent they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years they seemed to be arguing what looked like a fat little monk was saying forgive and forget i say we ought to give him a second chance my dear friar havent we given peeves all the chances he deserves he gives us all a bad name and you know hes not really even a ghost i say what are you all doing herea ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first yearsnobody answerednew students said the fat friar smiling around at them about to be sorted i supposea few people nodded mutelyhope to see you in hufflepuff said the friar my old house you knowmove along now said a sharp voice the sorting ceremonys about to startprofessor mcgonagall had returned one by one the ghosts floated away through the opposite wallnow form a line professor mcgonagall told the first years and follow mefeeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair with ron behind him and they walked out of the chamber back across the hall and through a pair of double doors into the great hallharry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place it was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables where the rest of the students were sittingthese tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets at the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sittingprofessor mcgonagall led the first years up here so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students with the teachers behind themthe hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight dotted here and there among the students the ghosts shone misty silver mainly to avoid all the staring eyes harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars he heard hermione whisper its bewitched to look like the sky outside i read about it in hogwarts a historyit was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all and that the great hall didnt simply open on to the heavensharry quickly looked down again as professor mcgonagall silently placed a fourlegged stool in front of the first years on top of the stool she put a pointed wizards hat this hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty aunt petunia wouldnt have let it in the housemaybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it harry thought wildly that seemed the sort of thing noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat he stared at it too for a few seconds there was complete silence then the hat twitched a rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth and the hat began to sing oh you may not think im pretty but dont judge on what you see ill eat myself if you can find a smarter hat than meyou can keep your bowlers black your top hats sleek and tall for im the hogwarts sorting hat and i can cap them alltheres nothing hidden in your head the sorting hat cant see so try me on and i will tell you where you ought to beyou might belong in gryffindor where dwell the brave at heart their daring nerve and chivalry set gryffindors apart you might belong in hufflepuff where they are just and loyal those patient hufflepuffis are true and unafraid of toil or yet in wise old ravenclaw if youve a ready mind where those of wit and learning will always find their kind or perhaps in slytherin youll make your real friends those cunning folk use any means to achieve their endsso put me on dont be afraid and dont get in a flap youre in safe hands though i have none for im a thinking capthe whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song it bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still againso weve just got to try on the hat ron whispered to harry ill kill fred he was going on about wrestling a trollharry smiled weakly yes trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching the hat seemed to be asking rather alot harry didnt feel brave or quickwitted or any of it at the moment if only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy that would have been the one for himprofessor mcgonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchmentwhen i call your name you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted she said abbott hannaha pinkfaced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line put on the hat which fell right down over her eyes and sat down a moments pause hufflepuff shouted the hatthe table on the right cheered and clapped as hannah went to sit down at the hufflepuff table harry saw the ghost of the fat friar waving merrily at herbones susanhufflepuff shouted the hat again and susan scuttled off to sit next to hannahboot terryravenclawthe table second from the left clapped this time several ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with terry as he joined thembrocklehurst mandy went to ravenclaw too but brown lavenderbecame the first new gryffindor and the table on the far left exploded with cheers harry could see rons twin brothers catcallingbulstrode millicent then became a slytherin perhaps it was harrys imagination after all hed heard about slytherin but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot he was starting to feel definitely sick now he remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old schoolhe had always been last to be chosen not because he was no good but because no one wanted dudley to think they liked himfinchfletchley justinhufflepuffsometimes harry noticed the hat shouted out the house at once but at others it took a little while to decide finnigan seamus the sandyhaired boy next to harry in the line sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a gryffindorgranger hermionehermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her headgryffindor shouted the hat ron groaneda horrible thought struck harry as horrible thoughts always do when youre very nervous what if he wasnt chosen at all what if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages until professor mcgonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and hed better get back on the train when neville longbottom the boy who kept losing his toad was called he fell over on his way to the stool the hat took a long time to decide with neville when it finally shouted gryffindor neville ran off still wearing it and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to macdougal moragmalfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed slytherinmalfoy went to join his friends crabbe and goyle looking pleased with himselfthere werent many people left now moon nott parkinson then a pair of twin girls patil and patil then perks sallyanne and then at last potter harryas harry stepped forward whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hallpotter did she saythe harry potterthe last thing harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat he waitedhmm said a small voice in his ear difficult very difficult plenty of courage i see not a bad mind either theres talent a my goodness yes and a nice thirst to prove yourself now thats interestingso where shall i put youharry gripped the edges of the stool and thought not slytherin not slytherinnot slytherin eh said the small voice are you sure you could be great you know its all here in your head and slytherin will help you on the way to greatness no doubt about that no well if youre sure better be gryffindorharry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall he took off the hat and walked shakily toward the gryffindor table he was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in slytherin he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet percy the prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously while the weasley twins yelled we got potter we got potter harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff hed seen earlier the ghost patted his arm giving harry the sudden horrible feeling hed just plunged it into a bucket of icecold waterhe could see the high table properly now at the end nearest him sat hagrid who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up harry grinned back and there in the center of the high table in a large gold chair sat albus dumbledore harry recognized him at once from the card hed gotten out of the chocolate frog on the train dumbledores silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts harry spotted professor quirtell too the nervous young man from the leaky cauldron he was looking very peculiar in a large purple turbanand now there were only three people left to be sorted thomas deana black boy even taller than ron joined harry at the gryffindor tableturpin lisa became a ravenclaw and then it was rons turn he was pale green by now harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted gryffindorharry clapped loudly with the rest as ron collapsed into the chair next to himwell done ron excellent said percy weasley pompously across harry as zabini blaise was made a slytherin professor mcgonagall rolled up her scroll and took the sorting hat awayharry looked down at his empty gold plate he had only just realized how hungry he was the pumpkin pasties seemed ages agoalbus dumbledore had gotten to his feet he was beaming at the students his arms opened wide as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all therewelcome he said welcome to a new year at hogwarts before we begin our banquet i would like to say a few words and here they are nitwit blubber oddment tweak thank youhe sat back down everybody clapped and cheered harry didnt know whether to laugh or notis he a bit mad he asked percy uncertainlymad said percy airily hes a genius best wizard in the world but he is a bit mad yes potatoes harryharrys mouth fell open the dishes in front of him were now piled with food he had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table roast beef roast chicken pork chops and lamb chops sausages bacon and steak boiled potatoes roast potatoes fries yorkshire pudding peas carrots gravy ketchup and for some strange reason peppermint humbugsthe dursleys had never exactly starved harry but hed never been allowed to eat as much as he liked dudley had always taken anything that harry really wanted even if it made him sick harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eatit was all deliciousthat does look good said the ghost in the ruff sadly watching harry cut up his steak cant you i havent eaten for nearly four hundred years said the ghost i dont need to of course but one does miss it i dont think ive in troduced myself sir nicholas de mimsyporpington at your service resident ghost of gryffindor toweri know who you are said ron suddenly my brothers told me about you youre nearly headless nicki would prefer you to call me sir nicholas de mimsy the ghost began stiffly but sandyhaired seamus finnigan interruptednearly headless how can you be nearly headlesssir nicholas looked extremely miffed as if their little chat wasnt going at all the way he wantedlike this he said irritably he seized his left ear and pulled his whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge someone had obviously tried to behead him but not done it properly looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces nearly headless nick flipped his head back onto his neck coughed and said so new gryffindors i hope youre going to help us win the house championship this year gryffindors have never gone so long without winning slytherins have got the cup six years in a row the bloody barons becoming almost unbearable hes the slytherin ghostharry looked over at the slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there with blank staring eyes a gaunt face and robes stained with silver blood he was right next to malfoy who harry was pleased to see didnt look too pleased with the seating arrangementshow did he get covered in blood asked seamus with great interestive never asked said nearly headless nick delicatelywhen everyone had eaten as much as they could the remains of the food faded from the plates leaving them sparkling clean as before a moment later the desserts appeared blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of apple pies treacle tarts chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts trifle strawberries jello rice pudding Ã¢â‚¬Å“as harry helped himself to a treacle tart the talk turned to their familiesim halfandhalf said seamus me dads a muggle mom didnt tell him she was a witch til after they were married bit of a nasty shock for himthe others laughedwhat about you neville said ronwell my gran brought me up and shes a witch said neville but the family thought i was all muggle for ages my great uncle algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me he pushed me off the end of blackpool pier once i nearly drowned but nothing happened until i was eight great uncle algie came round for dinner and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my great auntie enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go but i bounced all the way down the garden and into the road they were all really pleased gran was crying she was so happy and you should have seen their faces when i got in here they thought i might not be magic enough to come you see great uncle algie was so pleased he bought me my toadon harrys other side percy weasley and hermione were talking about lessons i do hope they start right away theres so much to learn im particularly interested in transfiguration you know turning something into something else of course its supposed to be very difficult youll be starting small just matches into needles and that sort of thing harry who was starting to feel warm and sleepy looked up at the high table again hagrid was drinking deeply from his gobletprofessor mcgonagall was talking to professor dumbledore professor quirrell in his absurd turban was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair a hooked nose and sallow skinit happened very suddenly the hooknosed teacher looked past quirrells turban straight into harrys eyes and a sharp hot pain shot across the scar on harrys foreheadouch harry clapped a hand to his headwhat is it asked percynnothingthe pain had gone as quickly as it had come harder to shake off was the feeling harry had gotten from the teachers look a feeling that he didnt like harry at allwhos that teacher talking to professor quirrell he asked percyoh you know quirrell already do you no wonder hes looking so nervous thats professor snape he teaches potions but he doesnt want to everyone knows hes after quirrells job knows an awful lot about the dark arts snapeharry watched snape for a while but snape didnt look at him againat last the desserts too disappeared and professor dumbledore got to his feet again the hall fell silentahern just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered i have a few startofterm notices to give youfirst years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils and a few of our older students would do well to remember that as welldumbledores twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the weasley twinsi have also been asked by mr filch the caretaker to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridorsquidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact madam hoochand finally i must tell you that this year the thirdfloor corridor on the righthand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful deathharry laughed but he was one of the few who didhes not serious he muttered to percymust be said percy frowning at dumbledore its odd because he usually gives us a reason why were not allowed to go somewhere the forests full of dangerous beasts everyone knows that i do think he might have told us prefects at leastand now before we go to bed let us sing the school song cried dumbledore harry noticed that the other teachers smiles had become rather fixeddumbledore gave his wand a little flick as if he was trying to get a fly off the end and a long golden ribbon flew out of it which rose high above the tables and twisted itself snakelike into wordseveryone pick their favorite tune said dumbledore and off we goand the school bellowed hogwarts hogwarts hoggy warty hogwarts teach us something please whether we be old and bald or young with scabby knees our heads could do with filling with some interesting stuff for now theyre bare and full of air dead flies and bits of fluff so teach us things worth knowing bring back what weve forgot just do your best well do the rest and learn until our brains all roteverybody finished the song at different times at last only the weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral marchdumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished he was one of those who clapped loudestah music he said wiping his eyes a magic beyond all we do here and now bedtime off you trotthe gryffindor first years followed percy through the chattering crowds out of the great hall and up the marble staircase harrys legs were like lead again but only because he was so tired and full of food he was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed or that twice percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries they climbed more staircases yawning and dragging their feet and harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halta bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them and as percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at himpeeves percy whispered to the first years a poltergeist he raised his voice peeves show yourselfa loud rude sound like the air being let out of a balloon answereddo you want me to go to the bloody baronthere was a pop and a little man with wicked dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared floating cross legged in the air clutching the walking sticksoooooooh he said with an evil cackle ickle firsties what funhe swooped suddenly at them they all duckedgo away peeves or the baronll hear about this i mean it barked percypeeves stuck out his tongue and vanished dropping the walking sticks on nevilles head they heard him zooming away rattling coats of armor as he passedyou want to watch out for peeves said percy as they set off againthe bloody barons the only one who can control him he wont even listen to us prefects here we areat the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dresspassword she said caput draconis said percy and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall they all scrambled through it neville needed a leg up and found themselves in the gryffindor common room a cozy round room full of squashy armchairspercy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another at the top of a spiral staircase they were obviously in one of the towers they found their beds at last five fourposters hung with deep red velvet curtains their trunks had already been brought up too tired to talk much they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bedgreat food isnt it ron muttered to harry through the hangingsget off scabbers hes chewing my sheetsharry was going to ask ron if hed had any of the treacle tart but he fell asleep almost at onceperhaps harry had eaten a bit too much because he had a very strange dream he was wearing professor quirrells turban which kept talking to him telling him he must transfer to slytherin at once because it was his destiny harry told the turban he didnt want to be in slytherin it got heavier and heavier he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully and there was malfoy laughing at him as he struggled with it then malfoy turned into the hooknosed teacher snape whose laugh became high and cold there was a burst of green light and harry woke sweating and shakinghe rolled over and fell asleep again and when he woke next day he didnt remember the dream at allchapter eightthe potions masterthere lookwherenext to the tall kid with the red hairwearing the glassesdid you see his facedid you see his scarwhispers followed harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day people lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again staringharry wished they wouldnt because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classesthere were a hundred and fortytwo staircases at hogwarts wide sweeping ones narrow rickety ones some that led somewhere different on a friday some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump then there were doors that wouldnt open unless you asked politely or tickled them in exactly the right place and doors that werent really doors at all but solid walls just pretending it was also very hard to remember where anything was because it all seemed to move around a lot the people in the portraits kept going to visit each other and harry was sure the coats of armor could walkthe ghosts didnt help either it was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open nearly headless nick was always happy to point new gryffindors in the right direction but peeves the poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class he would drop wastepaper baskets on your head pull rugs from under your feet pelt you with bits of chalk or sneak up behind you invisible grab your nose and screech got your conkeven worse than peeves if that was possible was the caretaker argus filch harry and ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the outofbounds corridor on the third floor he wouldnt believe they were lost was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by professor quirrell who was passingfilch owned a cat called mrs norris a scrawny dustcolored creature with bulging lamp like eyes just like filchs she patrolled the corridors alone break a rule in front of her put just one toe out of line and shed whisk off for filch whod appear wheezing two seconds later filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone except perhaps the weasley twins and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts the students all hated him and it was the dearest ambition of many to give mrs norris a good kickand then once you had managed to find them there were the classes themselves there was a lot more to magic as harry quickly found out than waving your wand and saying a few funny wordsthey had to study the night skies through their telescopes every wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study herbology with a dumpy little witch called professor sprout where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi and found out what they were used foreasily the most boring class was history of magic which was the only one taught by a ghost professor binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach leaving his body behind him binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates and got emetic the evil and uric the oddball mixed upprofessor flitwick the charms teacher was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk at the start of their first class he took the roll call and when he reached harrys name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sightprofessor mcgonagall was again different harry had been quite right to think she wasnt a teacher to cross strict and clever she gave them a talkingto the moment they sat down in her first classtransfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at hogwarts she said anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back you have been warnedthen she changed her desk into a pig and back again they were all very impressed and couldnt wait to get started but soon realized they werent going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long timeafter taking a lot of complicated notes they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle by the end of the lesson only hermione granger had made any difference to her match professor mcgonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave hermione a rare smilethe class everyone had really been looking forward to was defense against the dark arts but quirrells lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke his classroom smelled strongly of garlic which everyone said was to ward off a vampire hed met in romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days his turban he told them had been given to him by an african prince as a thankyou for getting rid of a troublesome zombie but they werent sure they believed this storyfor one thing when seamus finnigan asked eagerly to hear how quirrell had fought off the zombie quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather for another they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban and the weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well so that quirrell was protected wherever he wentharry was very relieved to find out that he wasnt miles behind everyone else lots of people had come from muggle families and like him hadnt had any idea that they were witches and wizards there was so much to learn that even people like ron didnt have much of a head startfriday was an important day for harry and ron they finally managed to find their way down to the great hall for breakfast without getting lost oncewhat have we got today harry asked ron as he poured sugar on his porridgedouble potions with the slytherins said ron snapes head of slytherin house they say he always favors them well be able to see if its truewish mcgonagall favored us said harry professor mcgonagall was head of gryffindor house but it hadnt stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day beforejust then the mail arrived harry had gotten used to this by now but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the great hall during breakfast circling the tables until they saw their owners and dropping letters and packages onto their lapshedwig hadnt brought harry anything so far she sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls this morning however she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto harrys plate harry tore it open at once it said in a very untidy scrawl dear harry i know you get friday afternoons off so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three i want to hear all about your first week send us an answer back with hedwighagrid harry borrowed rons quill scribbled yes please see you later on the back of the note and sent hedwig off againit was lucky that harry had tea with hagrid to look forward to because the potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so farat the startofterm banquet harry had gotten the idea that professor snape disliked him by the end of the first potions lesson he knew hed been wrong snape didnt dislike harry he hated himpotions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons it was colder here than up in the main castle and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the wallssnape like flitwick started the class by taking the roll call and like flitwick he paused at harrys nameah yes he said softly harry potter our new celebritydraco malfoy and his friends crabbe and goyle sniggered behind their hands snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class his eyes were black like hagrids but they had none of hagrids warmththey were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnelsyou are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking he began he spoke in barely more than a whisper but they caught every word like professor mcgonagall snape had y caught every word like professor mcgonagall snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort as there is little foolish wandwaving here many of you will hardly believe this is magic i dont expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins bewitching the mind ensnaring the senses i can teach you how to bottle fame brew glory even stopper death if you arent as big a bunch of dunderheads as i usually have to teachmore silence followed this little speech harry and ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows hermione granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasnt a dunderheadpotter said snape suddenly what would i get if i added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwoodpowdered root of what to an infusion of what harry glanced at ron who looked as stumped as he was hermiones hand had shot into the airi dont know sit said harrysnapes lips curled into a sneertut tut fame clearly isnt everythinghe ignored hermiones handlets try again potter where would you look if i told you to find me a bezoarhermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat but harry didnt have the faintest idea what a bezoar was he tried not to look at malfoy crabbe and goyle who were shaking with laughteri dont know sit thought you wouldnt open a book before coming eh potter harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes he had looked through his books at the dursleys but did snape expect him to remember everything in one thousand magical herbs and fungi snape was still ignoring hermiones quivering handwhat is the difference potter between monkshood and wolfsbaneat this hermione stood up her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceilingi dont know said harry quietly i think hermione does though why dont you try hera few people laughed harry caught seamuss eye and seamus winkedsnape however was not pleasedsit down he snapped at hermione for your information potter asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the draught of living death a bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons as for monkshood and wolfsbane they are the same plant which also goes by the name of aconite well why arent you all copying that downthere was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment over the noise snape said and a point will be taken from gryffindor house for your cheek potterthings didnt improve for the gryffindors as the potions lesson continued snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils he swept around in his long black cloak watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs criticizing almost everyone except malfoy whom he seemed to like he was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon neville had somehow managed to melt seamuss cauldron into a twisted blob and their potion was seeping across the stone floor burning holes in peoples shoes within seconds the whole class was standing on their stools while neville who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legsidiot boy snarled snape clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand i suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fireneville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nosetake him up to the hospital wing snape spat at seamus then he rounded on harry and ron who had been working next to nevilleyou potter why didnt you tell him not to add the quills thought hed make you look good if he got it wrong did you thats another point youve lost for gryffindorthis was so unfair that harry opened his mouth to argue but ron kicked him behind their cauldrondoi push it he muttered ive heard snape can turn very nastyas they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later harrys mind was racing and his spirits were low hed lost two points for gryffindor in his very first week why did snape hate him so much cheer upsaid ron snapes always taking points off fred and george can i come and meet hagrid with youat five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest a crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front doorwhen harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks then hagrids voice rang out saying back fang backhagrids big hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door openhang on he said back fanghe let them in struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhoundthere was only one room inside hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over itmake yerselves at home said hagrid letting go of fang who bounded straight at ron and started licking his ears like hagrid fang was clearly not as fierce as he lookedthis is ron harry told hagrid who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plateanother weasley eh said hagrid glancing at rons freckles i spent half me life chasin yer twin brothers away from the forestthe rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth but harry and ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told hagrid all about their first lessons fang rested his head on harrys knee and drooled all over his robesharry and ron were delighted to hear hagrid call fitch that old gitan as fer that cat mrs norris id like ter introduce her to fang sometime dyeh know every time i go up ter the school she follows me everywhere cant get rid of her fitch puts her up to itharry told hagrid about snapes lesson hagrid like ron told harry not to worry about it that snape liked hardly any of the studentsbut he seemed to really hate merubbish said hagrid why should heyet harry couldnt help thinking that hagrid didnt quite meet his eyes when he said thathows yer brother charlie hagrid asked ron i liked him a lot great with animalsharry wondered if hagrid had changed the subject on purpose while ron told hagrid all about charlies work with dragons harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy it was a cutting from the daily prophet gringotts breakin latest investigations continue into the breakin at gringotts on july widely believed to be the work of dark wizards or witches unknowngringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken the vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same daybut were not telling you what was in there so keep your noses out if you know whats good for you said a gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoonharry remembered ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob gringotts but ron hadnt mentioned the datehagrid said harry that gringotts breakin happened on my birthday it mightve been happening while we were therethere was no doubt about it hagrid definitely didnt meet harrys eyes this time he grunted and offered him another rock cake harry read the story again the vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen if you could call it emptying taking out that grubby little package had that been what the thieves were looking for as harry and ron walked back to the castle for dinner their pockets weighed down with rock cakes theyd been too polite to refuse harry thought that none of the lessons hed had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with hagrid had hagrid collected that package just in time where was it now and did hagrid know something about snape that he didnt want to tell harry chapter ninethe midnight duelharry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than dudley but that was before he met draco malfoy still firstyear gryffindors only had potions with the slytherins so they didnt have to put up with malfoy much or at least they didnt until they spotted a notice pinned up in the gryffindor common room that made them all groanflying lessons would be starting on thursday and gryffindor and slytherin would be learning togethertypical said harry darkly just what i always wanted to make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of malfoyhe had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything elseyou dont know that youll make a fool of yourself said ron reasonably anyway i know malfoys always going on about how good he is at quidditch but i bet thats all talkmalfay certainly did talk about flying a lot he complained loudly about first years never getting on the house quidditch teams and told long boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping muggles in helicopters he wasnt the only one though the way seamus finnigan told it hed spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick even ron would tell anyone whod listen about the time hed almost hit a hang glider on charlies old broomeveryone from wizarding families talked about quidditch constantly ron had already had a big argument with dean thomas who shared their dormitory about soccer ron couldnt see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly harry had caught ron prodding deans poster of west ham soccer team trying to make the players moveneville had never been on a broomstick in his life because his grandmother had never let him near one privately harry felt shed had good reason because neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the groundhermione granger was almost as nervous about flying as neville was this was something you couldnt learn by heart out of a book not that she hadnt tried at breakfast on thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips shed gotten out of a library book called quidditch through the ages neville was hanging on to her every word desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later but everybody else was very pleased when hermiones lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mailharry hadnt had a single letter since hagrids note something that malfoy had been quick to notice of course malfoys eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home which he opened gloatingly at the slytherin tablea barn owl brought neville a small package from his grandmother he opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble which seemed to be full of white smokeits a remembrall he explained gran knows i forget things this tells you if theres something youve forgotten to do look you hold it tight like this and if it turns red oh his face fell because the remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet youve forgotten somethingneville was trying to remember what hed forgotten when draco malfoy who was passing the gryffindor table snatched the remembrall out of his handharry and ron jumped to their feet they were half hoping for a reason to fight malfay but professor mcgonagall who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school was there in a flashwhats going onmalfoys got my remembrall professorscowling malfoy quickly dropped the remembrall back on the tablejust looking he said and he sloped away with crabbe and goyle behind himat threethirty that afternoon harry ron and the other gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson it was a clear breezy day and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest whose trees were swaying darkly in the distancethe slytherins were already there and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground harry had heard fred and george weasley complain about the school brooms saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high or always flew slightly to the lefttheir teacher madam hooch arrived she had short gray hair and yellow eyes like a hawkwell what are you all waiting for she barked everyone stand by a broomstick come on hurry upharry glanced down at his broom it was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd anglesstick out your right hand over your broom called madam hooch at the front and say up upf everyone shoutedharrys broom jumped into his hand at once but it was one of the few that did hermione grangers had simply rolled over on the ground and nevilles hadnt moved at all perhaps brooms like horses could tell when you were afraid thought harry there was a quaver in nevilles voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the groundmadam hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end and walked up and down the rows correcting their gripsharry and ron were delighted when she told malfoy hed been doing it wrong for yearsnow when i blow my whistle you kick off from the ground hard said madam hooch keep your brooms steady rise a few feet and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly on my whistle three two but neville nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground pushed off hard before the whistle had touched madam hoochs lipscome back boy she shouted but neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle twelve feet twenty feet harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away saw him gasp slip sideways off the broom and wham a thud and a nasty crack and neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap his broomstick was still rising higher and higher and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sightmadam hooch was bending over neville her face as white as hisbroken wrist harry heard her mutter come on boy its all right up you getshe turned to the rest of the classnone of you is to move while i take this boy to the hospital wing you leave those brooms where they are or youll be out of hogwarts before you can say quidditch come on dearneville his face tearstreaked clutching his wrist hobbled off with madam hooch who had her arm around himno sooner were they out of earshot than malfoy burst into laughterdid you see his face the great lumpthe other slytherins joined inshut up malfoy snapped parvati patilooh sticking up for longbottom said pansy parkinson a hardfaced slytherin girl never thought youd like fat little crybabies parvatilook said malfoy darting forward and snatching something out of the grass its that stupid thing longbottoms gran sent himthe remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it upgive that here malfoy said harry quietly everyone stopped talking to watchmalfoy smiled nastilyi think ill leave it somewhere for longbottom to find how about up a treegive it here harry yelled but malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off he hadnt been lying he could fly well hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called come and get it potterharry grabbed his broomno shouted hermione granger madam hooch told us not to move youll get us all into troubleharry ignored her blood was pounding in his ears he mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up up he soared air rushed through his hair and his robes whipped out behind him and in a rush of fierce joy he realized hed found something he could do without being taught this was easy this was wonderful he pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from ronhe turned his broomstick sharply to face malfoy in midair malfoy looked stunnedgive it here harry called or ill knock you off that broom oh yeah said malfoy trying to sneer but looking worriedharry knew somehow what to do he leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands and it shot toward malfay like a javelin malfoy only just got out of the way in time harry made a sharp aboutface and held the broom steady a few people below were clappingno crabbe and goyle up here to save your neck malfoy harry calledthe same thought seemed to have struck malfoycatch it if you can then he shouted and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the groundharry saw as though in slow motion the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall he leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive racing the ball wind whistled in his ears mingled with the screams of people watching he stretched out his hand a foot from the ground he caught it just in time to pull his broom straight and he toppled gently onto the grass with the remembrall clutched safely in his fistharry potterhis heart sank faster than hed just dived professor mcgonagall was running toward them he got to his feet tremblingnever in all my time at hogwarts professor mcgonagall was almost speechless with shock and her glasses flashed furiously how dare you might have broken your neck it wasnt his fault professor be quiet miss patil but malfoy thats enough mr weasley potter follow me nowharry caught sight of malfoy crabbe and goyles triumphant faces as he left walking numbly in professor mcgonagalls wake as she strode toward the castle he was going to be expelled he just knew it he wanted to say something to defend himself but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice professor mcgonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him he had to jog to keep up now hed done it he hadnt even lasted two weeks hed be packing his bags in ten minutes what would the dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep up the front steps up the marble staircase inside and still professor mcgonagall didnt say a word to him she wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with harry trotting miserably behind her maybe she was taking him to dumbledore he thought of hagrid expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper perhaps he could be hagrids assistant his stomach twisted as he imagined it watching ron and the others becoming wizards while he stumped around the grounds carrying hagrids bagprofessor mcgonagall stopped outside a classroom she opened the door and poked her head insideexcuse me professor flitwick could i borrow wood for a momentwood thought harry bewildered was wood a cane she was going to use on him but wood turned out to be a person a burly fifthyear boy who came out of flitwicles class looking confusedfollow me you two said professor mcgonagall and they marched on up the corridor wood looking curiously at harryin hereprofessor mcgonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for peeves who was busy writing rude words on the blackboardout peeves she barked peeves threw the chalk into a bin which clanged loudly and he swooped out cursing professor mcgonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boyspotter this is oliver wood wood ive found you a seekerwoods expression changed from puzzlement to delightare you serious professorabsolutely said professor mcgonagall crisply the boys a naturalive never seen anything like it was that your first time on a broomstick potterharry nodded silently he didnt have a clue what was going on but he didnt seem to be being expelled and some of the feeling started coming back to his legshe caught that thing in his hand after a fiftyfoot dive professor mcgonagall told wood didnt even scratch himself charlie weasley couldnt have done itwood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at onceever seen a game of quidditch potter he asked excitedlywoods captain of the gryffindor team professor mcgonagall explainedhes just the build for a seeker too said wood now walking around harry and staring at him light speedy well have to

hard potter or i may change my mind about punishing youthen she suddenly smiledyour father would have been proud she said he was an excellent quidditch player himselfyoure jokingit was dinnertime harry had just finished telling ron what had happened when hed left the grounds with professor mcgonagall ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth but hed forgotten all about itseeker he said but first years never you must be the youngest house player in about a century said harry shoveling pie into his mouth he felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon wood told meron was so amazed so impressed he just sat and gaped at harryi start training next week said harry only dont tell anyone wood wants to keep it a secretfred and george weasley now came into the hall spotted harry and hurried overwell done said george in a low voice wood told us were on the team too beatersi tell you were going to win that quidditch cup for sure this yearsaid fred we havent won since charlie left but this years team is going to be brilliant you must be good harry wood was almost skipping when he told usanyway weve got to go lee jordan reckons hes found a new secret passageway out of the schoolbet its that one behind the statue of gregory the smarmy that we found in our first week see youfred and george had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up malfoy flanked by crabbe and goylehaving a last meal potter when are you getting the train back to the mugglesyoure a lot braver now that youre back on the ground and youve got your little friends with you said harry coolly there was of course nothing at all little about crabbe and goyle but as the high table was full of teachers neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowlid take you on anytime on my own said malfoy tonight if you wantwizards duel wands only no contact whats the matter never heard of a wizards duel before i supposeof course he has said ron wheeling around im his second whos yoursmalfoy looked at crabbe and goyle sizing them upcrabbe he said midnight all right well meet you in the trophy room thats always unlockedwhen malfoy had gone ron and harry looked at each other what is a wizards duel said harry and what do you mean youre my secondwell a seconds there to take over if you die said ron casually getting started at last on his cold pie catching the look on harrys face he added quickly but people only die in proper duels you know with real wizards the most you and malfoyll be able to do is send sparks at each other neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage i bet he expected you to refuse anywayand what if i wave my wand and nothing happensthrow it away and punch him on the nose ron suggested excuse methey both looked up it was hermione grangercant a person eat in peace in this place said ronhermione ignored him and spoke to harryi couldnt help overhearing what you and malfoy were saying bet you could ron mutteredand you mustnt go wandering around the school at night think of the points youll lose gryffindor if youre caught and youre bound to beits really very selfish of youand its really none of your business said harrygoodbye said ronall the same it wasnt what youd call the perfect end to the day harry thought as he lay awake much later listening to dean and seamus falling asleep neville wasnt back from the hospital wing ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as if he tries to curse you youd better dodge it because i cant remember how to block themthere was a very good chance they were going to get caught by filch or mrs norris and harry felt he was pushing his luck breaking another school rule today on the other hand malfoys sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness this was his big chance to beat malfoy facetoface he couldnt miss ithalfpast eleven ron muttered at last wed better gothey pulled on their bathrobes picked up their wands and crept across the tower room down the spiral staircase and into the gryffindor common room a few embers were still glowing in the fireplace turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows they had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them i cant believe youre going to do this harrya lamp flickered on it was hermione granger wearing a pink bathrobe and a frownyou said ron furiously go back to bedi almost told your brother hermione snapped percy hes a prefect hed put a stop to thisharry couldnt believe anyone could be so interferingcome on he said to ron he pushed open the portrait of the fat lady and climbed through the holehermione wasnt going to give up that easily she followed ron through the portrait hole hissing at them like an angry goosedont you care about gryffindor do you only care about yourselves i dont want slytherin to win the house cup and youll lose all the points i got from professor mcgonagall for knowing about switching spellsgo away all right but i warned you you just remember what i said when youre on the train home tomorrow youre so but what they were they didnt find out hermione had turned to the portrait of the fat lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting the fat lady had gone on a nighttime visit and hermione was locked out of gryffindor towernow what am i going to do she asked shrillythats your problem said ron weve got to go we re going to be latethey hadnt even reached the end of the corridor when hermione caught up with themim coming with you she saidyou are notdyou think im going to stand out here and wait for filch to catch me if he finds all three of us ill tell him the truth that i was trying to stop you and you can back me upyouve got some nerve said ron loudlyshut up both of you said harry sharply i heard somethingit was a sort of snufflingmrs norris breathed ron squinting through the darkit wasnt mrs norris it was neville he was curled up on the floor fast asleep but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearerthank goodness you found me ive been out here for hours i couldnt remember the new password to get in to bedkeep your voice down neville the passwords pig snout but it wont help you now the fat ladys gone off somewherehows your arm said harryfine said neville showing them madam pomfrey mended it in about a minutegood well look neville weve got to be somewhere well see you later dont leave me said neville scrambling to his feet i dont want to stay here alone the bloody barons been past twice alreadyron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at hermione and nevilleif either of you get us caught ill never rest until ive learned that curse of the bogies quirrell told us about and used it on youhermione opened her mouth perhaps to tell ron exactly how to use the curse of the bogies but harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forwardthey flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows at every turn harry expected to run into filch or mrs norris but they were lucky they sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy roommalfoy and crabbe werent there yet the crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them cups shields plates and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness they edged along the walls keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room harry took out his wand in case malfoy leapt in and started at once the minutes crept byhes late maybe hes chickened out ron whisperedthen a noise in the next room made them jump harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak and it wasnt malfoysniff around my sweet they might be lurking in a cornerit was filch speaking to mrs norris horrorstruck harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible they scurried silently toward the door away from filchs voice nevilles robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard filch enter the trophy roomtheyre in here somewhere they heard him mutter probably hidingthis way harry mouthed to the others and petrified they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor they could hear filch getting nearer neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run he tripped grabbed ron around the waist and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armorthe clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castlerun harry yelled and the four of them sprinted down the gallery not looking back to see whether filch was following they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another harry in the lead without any idea where they were or where they were going they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway hurtled along it and came out near their charms classroom which they knew was miles from the trophy roomi think weve lost him harry panted leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead neville was bent double wheezing and splutteringi told you hermione gasped clutching at the stitch in her chest i told youweve got to get back to gryffindor tower said ron quickly as possiblemalfoy tricked you hermione said to harry you realize that dont you he was never going to meet you filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room malfoy must have tipped him offharry thought she was probably right but he wasnt going to tell her thatlets goit wasnt going to be that simple they hadnt gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of themit was peeves he caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delightshut up peeves please youll get us thrown outpeeves cackledwandering around at midnight ickle firsties tut tut tut naughty naughty youll get caughtynot if you dont give us away peeves pleaseshould tell filch i should said peeves in a saintly voice but his eyes glittered wickedly its for your own good you knowget out of the way snapped ron taking a swipe at peeves this was a big mistakestudents out of bed peeves bellowed students out of bed down the charms corridorducking under peeves they ran for their lives right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door and it was lockedthis is it ron moaned as they pushed helplessly at the door were done for this is the end they could hear footsteps filch running as fast as he could toward peevess shoutsoh move over hermione snarled she grabbed harrys wand tapped the lock and whispered alohomorathe lock clicked and the door swung open they piled through it shut it quickly and pressed their ears against it listeningwhich way did they go peeves filch was saying quick tell mesay please dont mess with me peeves now where did they goshant say nothing if you dont say please said peeves in his annoying singsong voiceall right pleasenothing ha haaa told you i wouldnt say nothing if you didnt say please ha ha haaaaaa and they heard the sound of peeves whooshing away and filch cursing in ragehe thinks this door is locked harry whispered i think well be okay get off neville for neville had been tugging on the sleeve of harrys bathrobe for the last minute whatharry turned around and saw quite clearly what for a moment he was sure hed walked into a nightmare this was too much on top of everything that had happened so farthey werent in a room as he had supposed they were in a corridor the forbidden corridor on the third floor and now they knew why it was forbiddenthey were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor it had three headsthree pairs of rolling mad eyes three noses twitching and quivering in their direction three drooling mouths saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangsit was standing quite still all six eyes staring at them and harry knew that the only reason they werent already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise but it was quickly getting over that there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meantharry groped for the doorknob between filch and death hed take filchthey fell backward harry slammed the door shut and they ran they almost flew back down the corridor filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else because they didnt see him anywhere but they hardly cared all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster they didnt stop running until they reached the portrait of the fat lady on the seventh floorwhere on earth have you all been she asked looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed sweaty facesnever mind that pig snout pig snout panted harry and the portrait swung forward they scrambled into the common room and collapsed trembling into armchairsit was a while before any of them said anything neville indeed looked as if hed never speak againwhat do they think theyre doing keeping a thing like that locked up in a school said ron finally if any dog needs exercise that one doeshermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again you dont use your eyes any of you do you she snapped didnt you see what it was standing onthe floor harry suggested i wasnt looking at its feet i was too busy with its headsno not the floor it was standing on a trapdoor its obviously guarding somethingshe stood up glaring at themi hope youre pleased with yourselves we could all have been killed or worse expelled now if you dont mind im going to bedron stared after her his mouth openno we dont mind he said youd think we dragged her along wouldnt youbut hermione had given harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed the dog was guarding something what had hagrid said gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide except perhaps hogwartsit looked as though harry had found out where the grubby littie package from vault seven hundred and thirteen waschapter tenhalloweenmalfoy couldnt believe his eyes when he saw that harry and ron were still at hogwarts the next day looking tired but perfectly cheerfulindeed by the next morning harry and ron thought that meeting the threeheaded dog had been an excellent adventure and they were quite keen to have another one in the meantime harry filled ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from gringotts to hogwarts and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection its either really valuable or really dangerous said ronor both said harrybut as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long they didnt have much chance of guessing what it was without further cluesneither neville nor hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor all neville cared about was never going near the dog againhermione was now refusing to speak to harry and ron but she was such a bossy knowitall that they saw this as an added bonus all they really wanted now was a way of getting back at malfoy and to their great delight just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week lateras the owls flooded into the great hall as usual everyones attention was caught at once by a long thin package carried by six large screech owls harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him knocking his bacon to the floor they had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcelharry ripped open the letter first which was lucky because it said do not open the parcel at the tableit contains your new nimbus two thousand but i dont want everybody knowing youve got a broomstick or theyll all want one oliver wood will meet you tonight on the quidditch field at seven oclock for your first training sessionprofessor mcgonagall harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to ron to reada nimbus two thousand ron moaned enviously ive never even touched onethey left the hall quickly wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by crabbe and goyle malfoy seized the package from harry and felt itthats a broomstick he said throwing it back to harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face youll be in for it this time potter first years arent allowed themron couldnt resist itits not any old broomstick he said its a nimbus two thousandwhat did you say youve got at home malfoy a comet two sixty ron grinned at harry comets look flashy but theyre not in the same league as the nimbuswhat would you know about it weasley you couldnt afford half the handle malfoy snapped back i suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twigbefore ron could answer professor flitwick appeared at malfoys elbownot arguing i hope boys he squeakedpotters been sent a broomstick professor said malfoy quicklyyes yes thats right said professor flitwick beaming at harryprofessor mcgonagall told me all about the special circumstances potter and what model is ita nimbus two thousand sit said harry fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on malfoys face and its really thanks to malfoy here that ive got it he addedharry and ron headed upstairs smothering their laughter at malfoys obvious rage and confusion well its true harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase if he hadnt stolen nevilles remembrall i woulnt be on the teamso i suppose you think thats a reward for breaking rules came an angry voice from just behind them hermione was stomping up the stairs looking disapprovingly at the package in harrys handi thought you werent speaking to us said harryyes dont stop now said ron its doing us so much goodhermione marched away with her nose in the airharry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day it kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed or straying off to the quidditch field where hed be learning to play that night he bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating and then rushed upstairs with ron to unwrap the nimbus two thousand at lastwow ron sighed as the broomstick rolled onto harrys bedspreadeven harry who knew nothing about the different brooms thought it looked wonderful sleek and shiny with a mahogany handle it had a long tail of neat straight twigs and nimbus two thousand written in gold near the topas seven oclock drew nearer harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the quidditch field held never been inside the stadium before hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on at either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end they reminded harry of the little plastic sticks muggle children blew bubbles through except that they were fifty feet hightoo eager to fly again to wait for wood harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground what a feeling he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field the nimbus two thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touchhey potter come down oliver wood had arrived fie was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm harry landed next to himvery nice said wood his eyes glinting i see what mcgonagall meant you really are a natural im just going to teach you the rules this evening then youll be joining team practice three times a weekhe opened the crate inside were four differentsized ballsright said wood now quidditch is easy enough to understand even if its not too easy to play there are seven players on each sidethree of them are called chasersthree chasers harry repeated as wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ballthis balls called the quaffle said wood the chasers throw the quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal ten points every time the quaffle goes through one of the hoops follow methe chasers throw the quaffle and put it through the hoops to scoreharry recited so thats sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops isnt itwhats basketball said wood curiously never mind said harry quicklynow theres another player on each side whos called the keeper im keeper for gryffindor i have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoringthree chasers one keeper said harry who was determined to remember it all and they play with the quaffle okay got that so what are they for he pointed at the three balls left inside the boxill show you now said wood take thishe handed harry a small club a bit like a short baseball batim going to show you what the bludgers do wood said these two are the bludgershe showed harry two identical balls jet black and slightly smaller than the red quaffle harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the boxstand back wood warned harry he bent down and freed one of the bludgersat once the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at harrys face harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose and sent it zigzagging away into the air it zoomed around their heads and then shot at wood who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the groundsee wood panted forcing the struggling bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely the bludgers rocket around trying to knock players off their brooms thats why you have two beaters on each team the weasley twins are ours its their job to protect their side from the bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team so think youve got all thatthree chasers try and score with the quaffle the keeper guards the goal posts the beaters keep the bludgers away from their team harry reeled offvery good said wooder have the bludgers ever killed anyone harry asked hoping he sounded offhandnever at hogwarts weve had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that now the last member of the team is the seeker thats you and you dont have to worry about the quaffle or the bludgers unless they crack my head opendont worry the weasleys are more than a match for the bludgers i mean theyre like a pair of human bludgers themselveswood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ballcompared with the quaffle and the bludgers it was tiny about the size of a large walnut it was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wingsthis said wood is the golden snitch and its the most important ball of the lot its very hard to catch because its so fast and difficult to see its the seekers job to catch it youve got to weave in and out of the chasers beaters bludgers and quaffle to get it before the other teams seeker because whichever seeker catches the snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points so they nearly always win thats why seekers get fouled so much a game of quidditch only ends when the snitch is caught so it can go on for ages i think the record is three months they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep well thats it any questionsharry shook his head he understood what he had to do all right it was doing it that was going to be the problemwe wont practice with the snitch yet said wood carefully shutting it back inside the crate its too dark we might lose it lets try you out with a few of thesehe pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later he and harry were up in the air wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for harry to catchharry didnt miss a single one and wood was delighted after half an hour night had really fallen and they couldnt carry onthat quidditch cupll have our name on it this year said wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle i wouldnt be surprised if you turn out better than charlie weasley and he could have played for england if he hadnt gone off chasing dragonsperhaps it was because he was now so busy what with quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework but harry could hardly believe it when he realized that hed already been at hogwarts two months the castle felt more like home than privet drive ever had his lessons too were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basicson halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors even better professor flitwick announced in charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly something they had all been dying to try since theyd seen him make nevilles toad zoom around the classroom professor flitwick put the class into pairs to practice harrys partner was seamus finnigan which was a relief because neville had been trying to catch his eye ron however was to be working with hermione granger it was hard to tell whether ron or hermione was angrier about this she hadnt spoken to either of them since the day harrys broomstick had arrivednow dont forget that nice wrist movement weve been practicingsqueaked professor flitwick perched on top of his pile of books as usual swish and flick remember swish and flick and saying the magic words properly is very important too never forget wizard baruffio who said s instead of f and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chestit was very difficult harry and seamus swished and flicked but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it harry had to put it out with his hatron at the next table wasnt having much more luckwingardium leviosa he shouted waving his long arms like a windmillyoure saying it wrong harry heard hermione snap its winggardium leviosa make the gar nice and longyou do it then if youre so clever ron snarledhermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown flicked her wand and said wingardium leviosatheir feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their headsoh well done cried professor flitwick clapping everyone see here miss grangers done itron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class its no wonder no one can stand her he said to harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor shes a nightmare honestly Ã¢â‚¬Å“someone knocked into harry as they hurried past him it was hermioneharry caught a glimpse of her face and was startled to see that she was in tearsi think she heard youso said ron but he looked a bit uncomfortable she mustve noticed shes got no friendshermione didnt turn up for the next class and wasnt seen all afternoon on their way down to the great hall for the halloween feast harry and ron overheard parvati patil telling her friend lavender that hermione was crying in the girls bathroom and wanted to be left aloneron looked still more awkward at this but a moment later they had entered the great hall where the halloween decorations put hermione out of their mindsa thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds making the candles in the pumpkins stutter the feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates as it had at the startofterm banquetharry was just helping himself to a baked potato when professor quirrell came sprinting into the hall his turban askew and terror on his faceeveryone stared as he reached professor dumbledores chair slumped against the table and gasped troll in the dungeons thought you ought to knowhe then sank to the floor in a dead faintthere was an uproar it took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of professor dumbledores wand to bring silenceprefects he rumbled lead your houses back to the dormitories immediatelypercy was in his elementfollow me stick together first years no need to fear the troll if you follow my orders stay close behind me now make way first years coming through excuse me im a prefecthow could a troll get in harry asked as they climbed the stairsdont ask me theyre supposed to be really stupid said ron maybe peeves let it in for a halloween jokethey passed different groups of people hurrying in different directionsas they jostled their way through a crowd of confused hufflepuffs harry suddenly grabbed rons armive just thought hermionewhat about hershe doesnt know about the trollron bit his lipoh all right he snapped but percyd better not see usducking down they joined the hufflepuffs going the other way slipped down a deserted side corridor and hurried off toward the girls bathroom they had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind thempercy hissed ron pulling harry behind a large stone griffinpeering around it however they saw not percy but snape he crossed the corridor and disappeared from viewwhats he doing harry whispered why isnt he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teacherssearch mequietly as possible they crept along the next corridor after snapes fading footstepshes heading for the third floor harry said but ron held up his handcan you smell somethingharry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to cleanand then they heard it a low grunting and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet ron pointed at the end of a passage to the left something huge was moving toward them they shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlightit was a horrible sight twelve feet tall its skin was a dull granite gray its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut it had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat horny feet the smell coming from it was incredible it was holding a huge wooden club which dragged along the floor because its arms were so longthe troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside it waggled its long ears making up its tiny mind then slouched slowly into the roomthe keys in the lock harry muttered we could lock it ingood idea said ron nervouslythey edged toward the open door mouths dry praying the troll wasnt about to come out of it with one great leap harry managed to grab the key slam the door and lock ityesflushed with their victory they started to run back up the passage but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop a high petrified scream and it was coming from the chamber theyd just chained upoh no said ron pale as the bloody baronits the girls bathroom harry gaspedhermione they said togetherit was the last thing they wanted to do but what choice did they have wheeling around they sprinted back to the door and turned the key fumbling in their panic harry pulled the door open and they ran insidehermione granger was shrinking against the wall opposite looking as if she was about to faint the troll was advancing on her knocking the sinks off the walls as it wentconfuse it harry said desperately to ron and seizing a tap he threw it as hard as he could against the wallthe troll stopped a few feet from hermione it lumbered around blinking stupidly to see what had made the noise its mean little eyes saw harry it hesitated then made for him instead lifting its club as it wentoy peabrain yelled ron from the other side of the chamber and he threw a metal pipe at it the troll didnt even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder but it heard the yell and paused again turning its ugly snout toward ron instead giving harry time to run around itcome on run run harry yelled at hermione trying to pull her toward the door but she couldnt move she was still flat against the wall her mouth open with terrorthe shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk it roared again and started toward ron who was nearest and had no way to escapeharry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid he took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the trolls neck from behind the troll couldnt feel harry hanging there but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose and harrys wand had still been in his hand when hed jumped it had gone straight up one of the trolls nostrilshowling with pain the troll twisted and flailed its club with harry clinging on for dear life any second the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the clubhermione had sunk to the floor in fright ron pulled out his own wand not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head wingardium leviosathe club flew suddenly out of the trolls hand rose high high up into the air turned slowly over and dropped with a sickening crack onto its owners head the troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face with a thud that made the whole room trembleharry got to his feet he was shaking and out of breath ron was standing there with his wand still raised staring at what he had doneit was hermione who spoke firstis it deadi dont think so said harry i think its just been knocked outhe bent down and pulled his wand out of the trolls nose it was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glueurgh troll boogershe wiped it on the trolls trousersa sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look upthey hadnt realized what a racket they had been making but of course someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the trolls roars a moment later professor mcgonagall had come bursting into the room closely followed by snape with quirrell bringing up the rear quirrell took one look at the troll let out a faint whimper and sat quickly down on a toilet clutching his heartsnape bent over the troll professor mcgonagall was looking at ron and harry harry had never seen her look so angry her lips were whitehopes of winning fifty points for gryffindor faded quickly from harrys mindwhat on earth were you thinking of said professor mcgonagall with cold fury in her voice harry looked at ron who was still standing with his wand in the air youre lucky you werent killed why arent you in your dormitorysnape gave harry a swift piercing look harry looked at the floor he wished ron would put his wand downthen a small voice came out of the shadowsplease professor mcgonagall they were looking for memiss grangerhermione had managed to get to her feet at lasti went looking for the troll because i i thought i could deal with it on my own you know because ive read all about themron dropped his wand hermione granger telling a downright lie to a teacher if they hadnt found me id be dead now harry stuck his wand up its nose and ron knocked it out with its own club they didnt have time to come and fetch anyone it was about to finish me off when they arrivedharry and ron tried to look as though this story wasnt new to themwell in that case said professor mcgonagall staring at the three of them miss granger you foolish girl how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your ownhermione hung her head harry was speechless hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules and here she was pretending she had to get them out of trouble it was as if snape had started handing out sweetsmiss granger five points will be taken from gryffindor for this said professor mcgonagall im very disappointed in you if youre not hurt at all youd better get off to gryffindor tower students are finishing the feast in their houseshermione leftprofessor mcgonagall turned to harry and ronwell i still say you were lucky but not many first years could have taken on a fullgrown mountain troll you each win gryffindor five points professor dumbledore will be informed of this you may gothey hurried out of the chamber and didnt speak at all until they had climbed two floors up it was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll quite apart from anything elsewe should have gotten more than ten points ron grumbledfive you mean once shes taken off hermionesgood of her to get us out of trouble like that ron admitted mind you we did save hershe might not have needed saving if we hadnt locked the thing in with her harry reminded himthey had reached the portrait of the fat ladypig snout they said and enteredthe common room was packed and noisy everyone was eating the food that had been sent up hermione however stood alone by the door waiting for them there was a very embarrassed pause then none of them looking at each other they all said thanks and hurried off to get platesbut from that moment on hermione granger became their friend there are some things you cant share without ending up liking each other and knocking out a twelvefoot mountain troll is one of themchapter elevenquidditchas they entered november the weather turned very cold the mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel every morning the ground was covered in frost hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the quidditch field bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat rabbit fur gloves and enormous beaverskin bootsthe quidditch season had begun on saturday harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training gryffindor versus slytherin if gryffindor won they would move up into second place in the house championshiphardly anyone had seen harry play because wood had decided that as their secret weapon harry should be kept well secret but the news that he was playing seeker had leaked out somehow and harry didnt know which was worse people telling him hed be brilliant or people telling him theyd be running around underneath him holding a mattressit was really lucky that harry now had hermlone as a friend he didnt know how hed have gotten through all his homework without her what with all the lastminute quidditch practice wood was making them do she had also tent him quidditch through the ages which turned out to be a very interesting readharry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a world cup match in that seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players and that most serious quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them that although people rarely died playing quidditch referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the sahara deserthermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since harry and ron had saved her from the mountain troll and she was much nicer for it the day before harrys first quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jarthey were standing with their backs to it getting warm when snape crossed the yard harry noticed at once that snape was limping harry ron and hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view they were sure it wouldnt be allowed unfortunately something about their guilty faces caught snapes eye he limped over he hadnt seen the fire but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anywaywhats that youve got there potterit was quidditch through the ages harry showed himlibrary books are not to be taken outside the school said snapegive it to me five points from gryffindorhes just made that rule up harry muttered angrily as snape limped away wonder whats wrong with his legdunno but i hope its really hurting him said ron bitterlythe gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening harry ron and hermione sat together next to a window hermione was checking harry and rons charms homework for them she would never let them copy how will you learn but by asking her to read it through they got the right answers anywayharry felt restless he wanted quidditch through the ages back to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow why should he be afraid of snape getting up he told ron and hermione he was going to ask snape if he could have itbetter you than me they said together but harry had an idea that snape wouldnt refuse if there were other teachers listeninghe made his way down to the staffroom and knocked there was no answerhe knocked again nothingperhaps snape had left the book in there it was worth a try he pushed the door ajar and peered inside and a horrible scene met his eyessnape and filch were inside alone snape was holding his robes above his knees one of his legs was bloody and mangled filch was handing snape bandagesblasted thing snape was saying how are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at onceharry tried to shut the door quietly but pottersnapes face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to hide his leg harry gulpedi just wondered if i could have my book backget out outharry left before snape could take any more points from gryffindor he sprinted back upstairsdid you get it ron asked as harry joined them whats the matterin a low whisper harry told them what hed seenyou know what this means he finished breathlessly he tried to get past that threeheaded dog at halloween thats where he was going when we saw him hes after whatever its guarding and id bet my broomstick he let that troll in to make a diversionhermiones eyes were wideno he wouldnt she said i know hes not very nice but he wouldnt try and steal something dumbledore was keeping safehonestly hermione you think all teachers are saints or somethingsnapped ron im with harry i wouldnt put anything past snape but whats he after whats that dog guardingharry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question neville was snoring loudly but harry couldnt sleep he tried to empty his mind he needed to sleep he had to he had his first quidditch match in a few hours but the expression on snapes face when harry had seen his leg wasnt easy to forgetthe next morning dawned very bright and cold the great hall was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheer ful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good quidditch matchyouve got to eat some breakfasti dont want anythingjust a bit of toast wheedled hermioneim not hungryharry felt terrible in an hours time hed be walking onto the fieldharry you need your strength said seamus finnigan seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other teamthanks seamus said harry watching seamus pile ketchup on his sausagesby eleven oclock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the quidditch pitch many students had binoculars the seats might be raised high in the air but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimesron and hermione joined neville seamus and dean the west ham fan up in the top row as a surprise for harry they had painted a large banner on one of the sheets scabbers had ruined it said potter for president and dean who was good at drawing had done a large gryffindor lion underneath then hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different colorsmeanwhile in the locker room harry and the rest of the team were changing into their scarlet quidditch robes slytherin would be playing in greenwood cleared his throat for silenceokay men he saidand women said chaser angelina johnsonand women wood agreed this is itthe big one said fred weasleythe one weve all been waiting for said georgewe know olivers speech by heart fred told harry we were on the team last yearshut up you two said wood this is the best team gryffindors had in years were going to win i know ithe glared at them all as if to say or elseright its time good luck all of youharry followed fred and george out of the locker room and hoping his knees werent going to give way walked onto the field to loud cheersmadam hooch was refereeing she stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams her broom in her handnow i want a nice fair game all of you she said once they were all gathered around her harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the slytherin captain marcus flint a sixth year harry thought flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above flashing potter for president over the crowd his heart skipped he felt bravermount your brooms pleaseharry clambered onto his nimbus two thousandmadam hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistlefifteen brooms rose up high high into the air they were off and the quaffle is taken immediately by angelina johnson of gryffindor what an excellent chaser that girl is and rather attractive too jordansorry professorthe weasley twins friend lee jordan was doing the commentary for the match closely watched by professor mcgonagalland shes really belting along up there a neat pass to alicia spinnet a good find of oliver woods last year only a reserve back to johnson and no the slytherins have taken the quaffle slytherin captain marcus flint gains the quaffle and off he goes flint flying like an eagle up there hes going to sc no stopped by an excellent move by gryffindor keeper wood and the

the slytherins thats adrian pucey speeding off toward the goal posts but hes blocked by a second bludger sent his way by fred or george weasley cant tell which nice play by the gryffindor beater anyway and johnson back in possession of the quaffle a clear field ahead and off she goes shes really flying dodges a speeding bludger the goal posts are ahead come on now angelina keeper bletchley dives misses gryffindors scoregryffindor cheers filled the cold air with howls and moans from the slytherinsbudge up there move alonghagridron and hermione squeezed together to give hagrid enough space to join thembin watchin from me hut said hagrid patting a large pair of binoculars around his neck but it isnt the same as bein in the crowd no sign of the snitch yet ehnope said ron harry hasnt had much to do yetkept outta trouble though thats somethin said hagrid raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was harryway up above them harry was gliding over the game squinting about for some sign of the snitch this was part of his and woods game plankeep out of the way until you catch sight of the snitch wood had said we dont want you attacked before you have to bewhen angelina had scored harry had done a couple of looptheloops to let off his feelings now he was back to staring around for the snitchonce he caught sight of a flash of gold but it was just a reflection from one of the weasleys wristwatches and once a bludger decided to come pelting his way more like a cannonball than anything but harry dodged it and fred weasley came chasing after itall right there harry he had time to yell as he beat the bludger furiously toward marcus flintslytherin in possession lee jordan was saying chaser pucey ducks two bludgers two weasleys and chaser bell and speeds toward the wait a moment was that the snitcha murmur ran through the crowd as adrian pucey dropped the quaffle too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left earharry saw it in a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the streak of gold slytherin seeker terence higgs had seen it too neck and neck they hurtled toward the snitch all the chasers seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to watchharry was faster than higgs he could see the little round ball wings fluttering darting up ahead he put on an extra spurt of speed wham a roar of rage echoed from the gryffindors below marcus flint had blocked harry on purpose and harrys broom spun off course harry holding on for dear lifefoul screamed the gryffindorsmadam hooch spoke angrily to flint and then ordered a free shot at the goal posts for gryffindor but in all the confusion of course the golden snitch had disappeared from sight againdown in the stands dean thomas was yelling send him off ref red cardwhat are you talking about dean said ronred card said dean furiously in soccer you get shown the red card and youre out of the gamebut this isnt soccer dean ron reminded himhagrid however was on deans sidethey oughta change the rules flint coulda knocked harry outta the airlee jordan was finding it difficult not to take sidesso after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating jordan growled professor mcgonagalli mean after that open and revolting foul jordan im warning you all right all right flint nearly kills the gryffindor seeker which could happen to anyone im sure so a penalty to gryffindor taken by spinner who puts it away no trouble and we continue play gryffindor still in possessionit was as harry dodged another bludger which went spinning dangerously past his head that it happened his broom gave a sudden frightening lurch for a split second he thought he was going to fall he gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and knees hed never felt anything like thatit happened again it was as though the broom was trying to buck him off but nimbus two thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off harry tried to turn back toward the gryffindor goal posts he had half a mind to ask wood to call timeout and then he realized that his broom was completely out of his control he couldnt turn it he couldnt direct it at all it was zigzagging through the air and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated himlee was still commentatingslytherin in possession flint with the quaffle passes spinnet passes bell hit hard in the face by a bludger hope it broke his nose only joking professor slytherins score a nothe slytherins were cheering no one seemed to have noticed that harrys broom was behaving strangely it was carrying him slowly higher away from the game jerking and twitching as it wentdunno what harry thinks hes doing hagrid mumbled he stared through his binoculars if i didn know better id say hed lost control of his broom but he cant havesuddenly people were pointing up at harry all over the stands his broom had started to roll over and over with him only just managing to hold on then the whole crowd gasped harrys broom had given a wild jerk and harry swung off it he was now dangling from it holding on with only one handdid something happen to it when flint blocked him seamus whisperedcant have hagrid said his voice shaking cant nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful dark magic no kid could do that to a nimbus two thousandat these words hermione seized hagrids binoculars but instead of looking up at harry she started looking frantically at the crowdwhat are you doing moaned ron grayfacedi knew it hermione gasped snape lookron grabbed the binoculars snape was in the middle of the stands opposite them he had his eyes fixed on harry and was muttering nonstop under his breathhes doing something jinxing the broom said hermionewhat should we doleave it to mebefore ron could say another word hermione had disappeared ron turned the binoculars back on harry his broom was vibrating so hard it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer the whole crowd was on its feet watching terrified as the weasleys flew up to try and pull harry safely onto one of their brooms but it was no good every time they got near him the broom would jump higher still they dropped lower and circled beneath him obviously hoping to catch him if he fellmarcus flint seized the quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticingcome on hermione ron muttered desperatelyhermione had fought her way across to the stand where snape stood and was now racing along the row behind him she didnt even stop to say sorry as she knocked professor quirrell headfirst into the row in frontreaching snape she crouched down pulled out her wand and whispered a few well chosen words bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of snapes robesit took perhaps thirty seconds for snape to realize that he was on firea sudden yelp told her she had done her job scooping the fire off him into a little jar in her pocket she scrambled back along the row snape would never know what had happenedit was enough up in the air harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broomneville you can look ron said neville had been sobbing into hagrids jacket for the last five minutesharry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick he hit the field on all fours coughed and something gold fell into his handive got the snitch he shouted waving it above his head and the game ended in complete confusionhe didnt catch it he nearly swallowed it flint was still howling twenty minutes later but it made no difference harry hadnt broken any rules and lee jordan was still happily shouting the results gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty harry heard none of this though he was being made a cup of strong tea back in hagrids hut with ron and hermioneit was snape ron was explaining hermione and i saw him he was cursing your broomstick muttering he wouldnt take his eyes off yourubbish said hagrid who hadnt heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stands why would snape do somethin like thatharry ron and hermione looked at one another wondering what to tell him harry decided on the truthi found out something about him he told hagrid he tried to get past that threeheaded dog on halloween it bit him we think he was trying to steal whatever its guardinghagrid dropped the teapothow do you know about fluffy he saidfluffyyeah hes mine bought him off a greek chappie i met in the pub las year i lent him to dumbledore to guard the yes said harry eagerlynow dont ask me anymore said hagrid gruffly thats top secret that isbut snapes trying to steal itrubbish said hagrid again snapes a hogwarts teacher hed do nothin of the sortso why did he just try and kill harry cried hermionethe afternoons events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about snapei know a jinx when i see one hagrid ive read all about them youve got to keep eye contact and snape wasnt blinking at all i saw himim tellin yeh yer wrong said hagrid hotly i don know why harrys broom acted like that but snape wouldn try an kill a student now listen to me all three of yeh yer meddlin in things that don concern yeh its dangerous you forget that dog an you forget what its guardin thats between professor dumbledore an nicolas flamel aha said harry so theres someone called nicolas flamel involved is therehagrid looked furious with himselfchapter twelvethe mirror of erisedchristmas was coming one morning in middecember hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow the lake froze solid and the weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed quirrell around bouncing off the back of his turban the few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by hagrid before they could fly off againno one could wait for the holidays to start while the gryffindor common room and the great hall had roaring fires the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classroomsworst of all were professor snapes classes down in the dungeons where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldronsi do feel so sorry said draco malfoy one potions class for all those people who have to stay at hogwarts for christmas because theyre not wanted at homehe was looking over at harry as he spoke crabbe and goyle chuckledharry who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish ignored themmalfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the quidditch match disgusted that the slytherins had lost he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a widemouthed tree frog would be replacing harry as seeker next then hed realized that nobody found this funny because they were all so impressed at the way harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick so malfoy jealous and angry had gone back to taunting harry about having no proper familyit was true that harry wasnt going back to privet drive for christmasprofessor mcgonagall had come around the week before making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays and harry had signed up at once he didnt feel sorry for himself at all this would probably be the best christmas hed ever had ron and his brothers were staying too because mr and mrs weasley were going to romania to visit charliewhen they left the dungeons at the end of potions they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that hagrid was behind ithi hagrid want any help ron asked sticking his head through the branchesnah im all right thanks ronwould you mind moving out of the way came malfoys cold drawl from behind them are you trying to earn some extra money weasley hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave hogwarts i suppose that hut of hagrids must seem like a palace compared to what your familys used toron dived at malfoy just as snape came up the stairsweasleyron let go of the front of malfoys robeshe was provoked professor snape said hagrid sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree malfoy was insultin his familybe that as it may fighting is against hogwarts rules hagrid said snape silkily five points from gryffindor weasley and be grateful it isnt more move along all of youmalfoy crabbe and goyle pushed roughly past the tree scattering needles everywhere and smirkingill get him said ron grinding his teeth at malfoys back one of these days ill get him i hate them both said harry malfoy and snapecome on cheer up its nearly christmas said hagrid tell yeh what come with me an see the great hall looks a treatso the three of them followed hagrid and his tree off to the great hall where professor mcgonagall and professor flitwick were busy with the christmas decorationsah hagrid the last tree put it in the far corner would youthe hall looked spectacular festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls and no less than twelve towering christmas trees stood around the room some sparkling with tiny icicles some glittering with hundreds of candleshow many days you got left until yer holidays hagrid askedjust one said hermione and that reminds me harry ron weve got half an hour before lunch we should be in the libraryoh yeah youre right said ron tearing his eyes away from professor flitwick who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new treethe library said hagrid following them out of the hall just before the holidays bit keen arent yehoh were not working harry told him brightly ever since you mentioned nicolas flamel weve been trying to find out who he isyou what hagrid looked shocked listen here ive told yeh drop it its nothin to you what that dogs guardinwe just want to know who nicolas flamel is thats all said hermioneunless youd like to tell us and save us the trouble harry added we mustve been through hundreds of books already and we cant find him anywhere just give us a hint i know ive read his name somewhereim sayin nothin said hagrid flatlyjust have to find out for ourselves then said ron and they left hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the librarythey had indeed been searching books for flamels name ever since hagrid had let it slip because how else were they going to find out what snape was trying to steal the trouble was it was very hard to know where to begin not knowing what flamel might have done to get himself into a book he wasnt in great wizards of the twentieth century or notable magical names of our time he was missing too from important modern magical discoveries and a study of recent developments in wizardry and then of course there was the sheer size of the library tens of thousands of books thousands of shelves hundreds of narrow rowshermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random harry wandered over to the restricted section he had been wondering for a while if flamel wasnt somewhere in there unfortunately you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books and he knew hed never get one these were the books containing powerful dark magic never taught at hogwarts and only read by older students studying advanced defense against the dark artswhat are you looking for boynothing said harrymadam pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at himyoud better get out then go on outwishing hed been a bit quicker at thinking up some story harry left the library he ron and hermione had already agreed theyd better not ask madam pince where they could find flamel they were sure shed be able to tell them but they couldnt risk snape hearing what they were up toharry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything but he wasnt very hopeful they had been looking for two weeks after a but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasnt surprising theyd found nothing what they really needed was a nice long search without madam pince breathing down their necksfive minutes later ron and hermione joined him shaking their headsthey went off to lunchyou will keep looking while im away wont you said hermione and send me an owl if you find anythingand you could ask your parents if they know who flamel is said ronitd be safe to ask themvery safe as theyre both dentists said hermioneonce the holidays had started ron and harry were having too good a time to think much about flamel they had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire they sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork bread english muffins marshmallows and plotting ways of getting malfoy expelled which were fun to talk about even if they wouldnt workron also started teaching harry wizard chess this was exactly like muggle chess except that the figures were alive which made it a lot like directing troops in battle rons set was very old and batteredlike everything else he owned it had once belonged to someone else in his family in this case his grandfather however old chessmen werent a drawback at all ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wantedharry played with chessmen seamus finnigan had lent him and they didnt trust him at all he wasnt a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him which was confusing dont send me there cant you see his knight send him we can afford to lose him on christmas eve harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun but not expecting any presents at allwhen he woke early in the morning however the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bedmerry christmas said ron sleepily as harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobeyou too said harry will you look at this ive got some presentswhat did you expect turnips said ron turning to his own pile which was a lot bigger than harrysharry picked up the top parcel it was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was to harry from hagrid inside was a roughly cut wooden flute hagrid had obviously whittled it himself harry blew it it sounded a bit like an owla second very small parcel contained a notewe received your message and enclose your christmas present from uncle vernon and aunt petunia taped to the note was a fiftypence piecethats friendly said harryron was fascinated by the fifty penceweird he said nmat a shape this is moneyyou can keep it said harry laughing at how pleased ron was hagrid and my aunt and uncle so who sent thesei think i know who that ones from said ron turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel my mom i told her you didnt expect any presents and oh no he groaned shes made you a weasley sweaterharry had torn open the parcel to find a thick handknitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudgeevery year she makes us a sweater said ron unwrapping his own and mines always maroonthats really nice of her said harry trying the fudge which was very tastyhis next present also contained candy a large box of chocolate frogs from hermionethis only left one parcel harry picked it up and felt it it was very light he unwrapped itsomething fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds ron gaspedive heard of those he said in a hushed voice dropping the box of every flavor beans hed gotten from hermione if thats what i think it is theyre really rare and really valuablewhat is itharry picked the shining silvery cloth off the floor it was strange to the touch like water woven into materialits an invisibility cloak said ron a look of awe on his face im sure it is try it onharry threw the cloak around his shoulders and ron gave a yellit is look downharry looked down at his feet but they were gone he dashed to the mirror sure enough his reflection looked back at him just his head suspended in midair his body completely invisible he pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completelytheres a note said ron suddenly a note fell out of itharry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter written in narrow loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words your father left this in my possession before he died it is time it was returned to you use it wella very merry christmas to youthere was no signature harry stared at the note ron was admiring the cloakid give anything for one of these he said anything whats the matternothing said harry he felt very strange who had sent the cloak had it really once belonged to his father before he could say or think anything else the dormitory door was flung open and fred and george weasley bounded in harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight he didnt feel like sharing it with anyone else yetmerry christmashey look harrys got a weasley sweater toofred and george were wearing blue sweaters one with a large yellow f on it the other a gharrys is better than ours though said fred holding up harrys sweater she obviously makes more of an effort if youre not familywhy arent you wearing yours ron george demanded come on get it on theyre lovely and warmi hate maroon ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his headyou havent got a letter on yours george observed i suppose she thinks you dont forget your name but were not stupid we know were called gred and forgewhats all th is noisepercy weasley stuck his head through the door looking disapproving he had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he too carried a lumpy sweater over his arm which fred seizedp for prefect get it on percy come on were all wearing ours even harry got onei dont want said percy thickly as the twins forced the sweater over his head knocking his glasses askewand youre not sitting with the prefects today either said george christmas is a time for familythey frogmarched percy from the room his arms pinned to his side by his sweaterharry had never in all his life had such a christmas dinner a hundred fat roast turkeys mountains of roast and boiled potatoes platters of chipolatas tureens of buttered peas silver boats of thick rich gravy and cranberry sauce and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table these fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble muggle ones the dursleys usually bought with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside harry pulled a wizard cracker with fred and it didnt just bang it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke while from the inside exploded a rear admirals hat and several live white mice up at the high table dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizards hat for a flowered bonnet and was chuckling merrily at a joke professor flitwick had just read himflaming christmas puddings followed the turkey percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice harry watched hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine finally kissing professor mcgonagall on the cheek who to harrys amazement giggled and blushed her top hat lopsidedwhen harry finally left the table he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers including a pack of nonexplodable luminous balloons a growyourownwarts kit and his own new wizard chess setthe white mice had disappeared and harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as mrs norriss christmas dinnerharry and the weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds then cold wet and gasping for breath they returned to the fire in the gryffindor common room where harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to ron he suspected he wouldnt have lost so badly if percy hadnt tried to help him so muchafter a meal of turkey sandwiches crumpets trifle and christmas cake everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch percy chase fred and george all over gryffindor tower because theyd stolen his prefect badgeit had been harrys best christmas day ever yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it the invisibility cloak and whoever had sent itron full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him fell asleep almost as soon as hed drawn the curtains of his fourposter harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under ithis fathers this had been his fathers he let the material flow over his hands smoother than silk light as air use it well the note had saidhe had to try it now he slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself looking down at his legs he saw only moonlight and shadows it was a very funny feelinguse it wellsuddenly harry felt wideawake the whole of hogwarts was open to him in this cloak excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark and silence he could go anywhere in this anywhere and filch would never knowron grunted in his sleep should harry wake him something held him back his fathers cloak he felt that this time the first time he wanted to use it alonehe crept out of the dormitory down the stairs across the common room and climbed through the portrait holewhos there squawked the fat lady harry said nothing he walked quickly down the corridorwhere should he go he stopped his heart racing and thought and then it came to him the restricted section in the library hed be able to read as long as he liked as long as it took to find out who flamel washe set off drawing the invisibility cloak tight around him as he walkedthe library was pitchblack and very eerie harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books the lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair and even though harry could feel his arm supporting it the sight gave him the creepsthe restricted section was right at the back of the library step ping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library he held up his lamp to read the titlesthey didnt tell him much their peeling faded gold letters spelled words in languages harry couldnt understand some had no title at allone book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood the hairs on the back of harrys neck prickled maybe he was imagining it maybe not but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books as though they knew someone was there who shouldnt behe had to start somewhere setting the lamp down carefully on the floor he looked along the bottom shelf for an interestinglooking book a large black and silver volume caught his eye he pulled it out with difficulty because it was very heavy and balancing it on his knee let it fall opena piercing bloodcurdling shriek split the silence the book was screaming harry snapped it shut but the shriek went on and on one high unbroken earsplitting note he stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp which went out at once panicking he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf he ran for it he passed filch in the doorway filchs pale wild eyes looked straight through him and harry slipped under filchs outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor the books shrieks still ringing in his earshe came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor he had been so busy getting away from the library he hadnt paid attention to where he was going perhaps because it was dark he didnt recognize where he was at all there was a suit of armor near the kitchens he knew but he must be five floors above thereyou asked me to come directly to you professor if anyone was wandering around at night and somebodys been in the library restricted sectionharry felt the blood drain out of his face wherever he was filch must know a shortcut because his soft greasy voice was getting nearer and to his horror it was snape who replied the restricted section well they cant be far well catch themharry stood rooted to the spot as filch and snape came around the corner ahead they couldnt see him of course but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer theyd knock right into him the cloak didnt stop him from being solidhe backed away as quietly as he could a door stood ajar to his left it was his only hope he squeezed through it holding his breath trying not to move it and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything they walked straight past and harry leaned against the wall breathing deeply listening to their footsteps dying away that had been close very close it was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden init looked like an unused classroom the dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls and there was an upturned wastepaper basket but propped against the wall facing him was something that didnt look as if it belonged there something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the wayit was a magnificent mirror as high as the ceiling with an ornate gold frame standing on two clawed feet there was an inscription carved around the top erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi his panic fading now that there was no sound of filch and snape harry moved nearer to the mirror wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again he stepped in front of ithe had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming he whirled around his heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed for he had seen not only himself in the mirror but a whole crowd of people standing right behind himbut the room was empty breathing very fast he turned slowly back to the mirrorthere he was reflected in it white and scaredlooking and there reflected behind him were at least ten others harry looked over his shoulder but still no one was there or were they all invisible too was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirrors trick was that it reflected them invisible or not he looked in the mirror again a woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving he reached out a hand and felt the air behind him if she was really there hed touch her their reflections were so close together but he felt only air she and the others existed only in the mirrorshe was a very pretty woman she had dark red hair and her eyes her eyes are just like mine harry thought edging a little closer to the glass bright green exactly the same shape but then he noticed that she was crying smiling but crying at the same time the tall thin blackhaired man standing next to her put his arm around her he wore glasses and his hair was very untidy it stuck up at the back just as harrys didharry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflectionmom he whispered dadthey just looked at him smiling and slowly harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror and saw other pairs of green eyes like his other noses like his even a little old man who looked as though he had harrys knobbly knees harry was looking at his family for the first time in his lifethe potters smiled and waved at harry and he stared hungrily back at them his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them he had a powerful kind of ache inside him half joy half terrible sadnesshow long he stood there he didnt know the reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses he couldnt stay here he had to find his way back to bed he tore his eyes away from his mothers face whispered ill come backand hurried from the roomyou could have woken me up said ron crosslyyou can come tonight im going back i want to show you the mirrorid like to see your mom and dad ron said eagerlyand i want to see all your family all the weasleys youll be able to show me your other brothers and everyoneyou can see them any old time said ron just come round my house this summer anyway maybe it only shows dead people shame about not finding flamel though have some bacon or something why arent you eating anythingharry couldnt eat he had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight he had almost forgotten about flamel it didnt seem very important anymore who cared what the three headed dog was guarding what did it matter if snape stole it really are you all right said ron you look oddwhat harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again with ron covered in the cloak too they had to walk much more slowly the next night they tried retracing harrys route from the library wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hourim freezing said ron lets forget it and go backno harry hissed i know its here somewherethey passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction but saw no one else just as ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold harry spotted the suit of armorits here just here yesthey pushed the door open harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirrorthere they were his mother and father beamed at the sight of himsee harry whisperedi cant see anythinglook look at them all there are loads of themi can only see youlook in it properly go on stand where i amharry stepped aside but with ron in front of the mirror he couldnt see his family anymore just ron in his paisley pajamasron though was staring transfixed at his imagelook at me he saidcan you see all your family standing around youno im alone but im different i look older and im head boywhati am im wearing the badge like bill used to and im holding the house cup and the quidditch cup im quidditch captain tooron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at harrydo you think this mirror shows the futurehow can it all my family are dead let me have another look you had it to yourself all last night give me a bit more timeyoure only holding the quidditch cup whats interesting about that i want to see my parentsdont push me a sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussionthey hadnt realized how loudly they had been talkingquickron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of mrs norris came round the door ron and harry stood quite still both thinking the same thing did the cloak work on cats after what seemed an age she turned and leftthis isnt safe she might have gone for filch i bet she heard uscome onand ron pulled harry out of the roomthe snow still hadnt melted the next morningwant to play chess harry said ronnowhy dont we go down and visit hagridno you goi know what youre thinking about harry that mirror dont go back tonightwhy noti dunno ive just got a bad feeling about it and anyway youve had too many close shaves already filch snape and mrs norris are wandering around so what if they cant see you what if they walk into you what if you knock something overyou sound like hermioneim serious harry dont gobut harry only had one thought in his head which was to get back in front of the mirror and ron wasnt going to stop himthat third night he found his way more quickly than before he was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise but he didnt meet anyoneand there were his mother and father smiling at him again and one of his grandfathers nodding happily harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror there was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family nothing at allexcept so back again harryharry felt as though his insides had turned to ice he looked behind him sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than albus dumbledore harry must have walked straight past him so desperate to get to the mirror he hadnt noticed himi didnt see you sirstrange how nearsighted being invisible can make you said dumbledore and harry was relieved to see that he was smilingso said dumbledore slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with harry you like hundreds before you have discovered the delights of the mirror of erisedi didnt know it was called that sirbut i expect youve realized by now what it doesit well it shows me my family and it showed your friend ron himself as head boyhow did you know i dont need a cloak to become invisible said dumbledore gentlynow can you think what the mirror of erised shows us allharry shook his headlet me explain the happiest man on earth would be able to use the mirror of erised like a normal mirror that is he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is does that helpharry thought then he said slowly it shows us what we wantwhatever we wantyes and no said dumbledore quietly it shows us nothing more or less than the deepest most desperate desire of our hearts you who have never known your family see them standing around you ronald weasley who has always been overshadowed by his brothers sees himself standing alone the best of all of them however this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth men have wasted away before it entranced by what they have seen or been driven mad not knowing if what it shows is real or even possiblethe mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow harry and i ask you not to go looking for it again if you ever do run across it you will now be prepared it does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live remember that now why dont you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bedharry stood upsir professor dumbledore can i ask you somethingobviously youve just done so dumbledore smiled you may ask me one more thing howeverwhat do you see when you look in the mirrori i see myself holding a pair of thick woolen socksharry staredone can never have enough socks said dumbledore another christmas has come and gone and i didnt get a single pair people will insist on giving me booksit was only when he was back in bed that it struck harry that dumbledore might not have been quite truthful but then he thought as he shoved scabbers off his pillow it had been quite a personal questionchapter thirteennicolas flameldumbledore had convinced harry not to go looking for the mirror of erised again and for the rest of the christmas holidays the invisibility cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk harry wished he could forget what hed seen in the mirror as easily but he couldnt he started having nightmares over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light while a high voice cackled with laughteryou see dumbledore was right that mirror could drive you mad said ron when harry told him about these drearnshermione who came back the day before term started took a different view of things she was torn between horror at the idea of harry being out of bed roaming the school three nights in a row if filch had caught you and disappointment that he hadnt at least found out who nicolas flamel wasthey had almost given up hope of ever finding flamel in a li brary book even though harry was still sure hed read the name somewhereonce term had started they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks harry had even less time than the other two because quidditch practice had started againwood was working the team harder than ever even the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldnt dampen his spirits the weasleys complained that wood was becoming a fanatic but harry was on woods side if they won their next match against hufflepuff they would overtake slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven years quite apart from wanting to win harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after trainingthen during one particularly wet and muddy practice session wood gave the team a bit of bad news hed just gotten very angry with the weasleys who kept divebombing each other and pretending to fall off their broomswill you stop messing around he yelled thats exactly the sort of thing thatll lose us the match snapes refereeing this time and hell be looking for any excuse to knock points off gryffindorgeorge weasley really did fall off his broom at these wordssnapes refereeing he spluttered through a mouthful of mud whens he ever refereed a quidditch match hes not going to be fair if we might overtake slytherinthe rest of the team landed next to george to complain tooits not my fault said wood weve just got to make sure we play a clean game so snape hasnt got an excuse to pick on uswhich was all very well thought harry but he had another reason for not wanting snape near him while he was playing quidditchthe rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice but harry headed straight back to the gryffindor common room where he found ron and hermione playing chess chess was the only thing hermione ever lost at something harry and ron thought was very good for herdont talk to me for a moment said ron when harry sat down next to him i need to concen he caught sight of harrys face whats the matter with you you look terriblespeaking quietly so that no one else would hear harry told the other two about snapes sudden sinister desire to be a quidditch refereedont play said hermione at oncesay youre ill said ronpretend to break your leg hermione suggestedreally break your leg said roni cant said harry there isnt a reserve seeker if i back out gryffindor cant play at allat that moment neville toppled into the common room how he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyones guess because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the leglocker curse he must have had to bunny hop all the way up to gryffindor towereveryone fell over laughing except hermione who leapt up and performed the countercurse nevilles legs sprang apart and he got to his feet trembling what happened hermione asked him leading him over to sit with harry and ronmalfoy said neville shakily i met him outside the library he said hed been looking for someone to practice that ongo to professor mcgonagall hermione urged neville report himneville shook his headi dont want more trouble he mumbledyouve got to stand up to him neville said ron hes used to walking all over people but thats no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easiertheres no need to tell me im not brave enough to be in gryffindor malfoys already done that neville choked outharry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a chocolate frog the very last one from the box hermione had given him for christmas he gave it to neville who looked as though he might cryyoure worth twelve of malfoy harry said the sorting hat chose you for gryffindor didnt it and wheres malfoy in stinking slytherinnevilles lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frogthanks harry i think ill go to bed dyou want the card you collect them dont youas neville walked away harry looked at the famous wizard carddumbledore again he said he was the first one i everhe gasped he stared at the back of the card then he looked up at ron and hermioneive found him he whispered ive found flamel i told you id read the name somewhere before i read it on the train coming here listen to this dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard grindelwald in for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragons blood and his work on alchemy with his partner nicolas flamelhermione jumped to her feet she hadnt looked so excited since theyd gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homeworkstay there she said and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls dormitories harry and ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back an enormous old book in her armsi never thought to look in here she whispered excitedly i got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light readinglight said ron but hermione told him to be quiet until shed looked something up and started flicking frantically through the pages muttering to herselfat last she found what she was looking fori knew it i knew itare we allowed to speak yet said ron grumpily hermione ignored himnicolas flamel she whispered dramatically is the only known maker of the sorcerers stonethis didnt have quite the effect shed expectedthe what said harry and ronoh honestly dont you two read look read that thereshe pushed the book toward them and harry and ron read the ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the sorcerers stone a legendary substance with astonishing powers the stone will transform any metal into pure gold it also produces the elixir of life which will make the drinker immortalthere have been many reports of the sorcerers stone over the centuries but the only stone currently in existence belongs to mr nicolas flamel the noted alchemist and opera lover mr flamel who celebrated his six hundred and sixtyfifth birthday last year enjoys a quiet life in devon with his wife perenelle six hundred and fiftyeightsee said hermione when harry and ron had finished the dog must be guarding flamels sorcerers stone i bet he asked dumbledore to keep it safe for him because theyre friends and he knew someone was after it thats why he wanted the stone moved out of gringottsa stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying said harry no wonder snapes after it anyone would want itand no wonder we couldnt find flamel in that study of recent developments in wizardry said ron hes not exactly recent if hes six hundred and sixtyfive is hethe next morning in defense against the dark arts while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites harry and ron were still discussing what theyd do with a sorcerers stone if they had one it wasnt until ron said hed buy his own quidditch team that harry remembered about snape and the coming matchim going to play he told ron and hermione if i dont all the slytherins will think im just too scared to face snape ill show them itll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we winjust as long as were not wiping you off the field said hermioneas the match drew nearer however harry became more and more nervous whatever he told ron and hermione the rest of the team wasnt too calm either the idea of overtaking slytherin in the house championship was wonderful no one had done it for seven years but would they be allowed to with such a biased referee harry didnt know whether he was imagining it or not but he seemed to keep running into snape wherever he went at times he even wondered whether snape was following him trying to catch him on his own potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture snape was so horrible to harry could snape possibly know theyd found out about the sorcerers stone harry didnt see how he could yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that snape could read mindsharry knew when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon that ron and hermione were wondering whether theyd ever see him alive again this wasnt what youd call comforting harry hardly heard a word of woods pep talk as he pulled on his quidditch robes and picked up his nimbus two thousandron and hermione meanwhile had found a place in the stands next to neville who couldnt understand why they looked so grim and worried or why they had both brought their wands to the match little did harry know that ron and hermione had been secretly practicing the leglocker curse theyd gotten the idea from malfoy using it on neville and were ready to use it on snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt harrynow dont forget its locomotor mortis hermione muttered as ron slipped his wand up his sleevei know ron snapped dont nagback in the locker room wood had taken harry asidedont want to pressure you potter but if we ever need an early capture of the snitch its now finish the game before snape can favor hufflepuff too muchthe whole schools out there said fred weasley peering out of the door even blimey dumbledores come to watchharrys heart did a somersaultdumbledore he said dashing to the door to make sure fred was rightthere was no mistaking that silver beardharry could have laughed out loud with relief he was safe there was simply no way that snape would dare to try to hurt him if dumbledore was watchingperhaps that was why snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field something that ron noticed tooive never seen snape look so mean he told hermione look theyre off ouchsomeone had poked ron in the back of the head it was malfoyoh sorry weasley didnt see you theremalfoy grinned broadly at crabbe and goylewonder how long potters going to stay on his broom this time anyone want a bet what about you weasleyron didnt answer snape had just awarded hufflepuff a penalty because george weasley had hit a bludger at him hermione who had all her fingers crossed in her lap was squinting fixedly at harry who was circling the game like a hawk looking for the snitchyou know how i think they choose people for the gryffindor team said malfoy loudly a few minutes later as snape awarded hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all its people they feel sorry for see theres potter whos got no parents then theres the weasleys whove got no money you should be on the team longbottom youve got no brainsneville went bright red but turned in his seat to face malfoyim worth twelve of you malfoy he stammeredmalfoy crabbe and goyle howled with laughter but ron still not daring to take his eyes from the game said you tell him nevillelongbottom if brains were gold youd be poorer than weasley and thats saying somethingrons nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about harryim warning you malfoy one more word ron said hermione suddenly harry what whereharry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd hermione stood up her crossed fingers in her mouth as harry streaked toward the ground like a bulletyoure in luck weasley potters obviously spotted some money on the ground said malfoyron snapped before malfoy knew what was happening ron was on top of him wrestling him to the ground neville hesitated then clambered over the back of his seat to helpcome on harry hermione screamed leaping onto her seat to watch as harry sped straight at snape she didnt even notice malfoy and ron rolling around under her seat or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was neville crabbe and goyleup in the air snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him missing him by inches the next second harry had pulled out of the dive his arm raised in triumph the snitch clasped in his handthe stands erupted it had to be a record no one could ever remember the snitch being caught so quicklyron ron where are you the games over harrys won weve won gryffindor is in the lead shrieked hermione dancing up and down on her seat and hugging parvati patil in the row in frontharry jumped off his broom a foot from the ground he couldnt believe it hed done it the game was over it had barely lasted five minutes as gryffindors came spilling onto the field he saw snape land nearby whitefaced and tightlipped then harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into dumbledores smiling facewell done said dumbledore quietly so that only harry could hearnice to see you havent been brooding about that mirror been keeping busy excellentsnape spat bitterly on the groundharry left the locker room alone some time later to take his nimbus two thousand back to the broomshed he couldnt ever remember feeling happier hed really done something to be proud of now no one could say he was just a famous name any more the evening air had never smelled so sweet he walked over the damp grass reliving the last hour in his head which was a happy blur gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders ron and hermione in the distance jumping up and down ron cheering through a heavy nosebleedharry had reached the shed he leaned against the wooden door and looked up at hogwarts with its windows glowing red in the setting sungryffindor in the lead hed done it hed shown snapeand speaking of snapea hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle clearly not wanting to be seen it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest harrys victory faded from his mind as he watched he recognized the figures prowling walk snape sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner what was going on harry jumped back on his nimbus two thousand and took off gliding silently over the castle he saw snape enter the forest at a run he followedthe trees were so thick he couldnt see where snape had gone he flew in circles lower and lower brushing the top branches of trees until he heard voices he glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering beech treehe climbed carefully along one of the branches holding tight to his broomstick trying to see through the leaves below in a shadowy clearing stood snape but he wasnt alone quirrell was there tooharry couldnt make out the look on his face but he was stuttering worse than ever harry strained to catch what they were sayingddont know why you wanted ttto meet here of all pplaces severusoh i thought wed keep this private said snape his voice icystudents arent supposed to know about the sorcerers stone after allharry leaned forward quirrell was mumbling something snape interrupted himhave you found out how to get past that beast of hagrids yetbbbut severus i you dont want me as your enemy quirrell said snape taking a step toward himii dont know what you you know perfectly well what i meanan owl hooted loudly and harry nearly fell out of the tree he steadied himself in time to hear snape say your little bit of hocuspocusim waitingbbut i dddont very well snape cut in well have another little chat soon when youve had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties liehe threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing it was almost dark now but harry could see quirrell standing quite still as though he was petrifiedharry where have you been hermione squeakedwe won you won we won shouted ron thumping harry on the back and i gave malfoy a black eye and neville tried to take on crabbe and goyle singlehanded hes still out cold but madam pomftey says hell be all right talk about showing slytherin everyones waiting for you in the common room were having a party fred and george stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchensnever mind that now said harry breathlessly lets find an empty room you wait til you hear thishe made sure peeves wasnt inside before shutting the door behind them then he told them what hed seen and heardso we were right it is the sorcerers stone and snapes trying to force quirrell to help him get it he asked if he knew how to get past fluffy and he said something about quirrells hocus pocuss i reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from fluffy loads of enchantments probably and quirrell would have done some antidark arts spell that snape needs to break through so you mean the stones only safe as long as quirrell stands up to snape said hermione in alarmitll be gone by next tuesday said ronchapter fourteennorbert the norwegian ridgebackquirrell however must have been braver than theyd thought in the weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner but it didnt look as though hed cracked yetevery time they passed the thirdfloor corridor harry ron and hermione would press their ears to the door to check that fluffy was still growling inside snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper which surely meant that the stone was still safe whenever harry passed quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile and ron had started telling people off for laughing at quirrells stutterhermione however had more on her mind than the sorcerers stone she had started drawing up study schedules and colorcoding all her notesharry and ron wouldnt have minded but she kept nagging them to do the samehermione the exams are ages awayten weeks hermione snapped thats not ages thats like a second to nicolas flamelbut were not six hundred years old ron reminded her anyway what are you studying for you already know it awhat am i studying for are you crazy you realize we need to pass these exams to get into the second year theyre very important i should have started studying a month ago i dont know whats gotten into meunfortunately the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as hermione they piled so much homework on them that the easter holidays werent nearly as much fun as the christmas ones it was hard to relax with hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragons blood or practicing wand movements moaning and yawning harry and ron spent most of their free time in the library with her trying to get through all their extra workill never remember this ron burst out one afternoon throwing down his quill and looking longingly out of the library window it was the first really fine day theyd had in months the sky was a clear forgetmenot blue and there was a feeling in the air of summer comingharry who was looking up dittany in one thousand magical herbs and fungi didnt look up until he heard ron say hagrid what are you doing in the libraryhagrid shuffled into view hiding something behind his back he looked very out of place in his moleskin overcoatjus lookin he said in a shifty voice that got their interest at once an whatre you lot up ter he looked suddenly suspicious yer not still lookin fer nicolas flamel are yeh oh we found out who he is ages ago said ron impressively and we know what that dogs guarding its a sorcerers st

what section he was in said ron whod had enough of working he came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms and slammed them down on the tabledragons he whispered hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons look at these dragon species of great britain and ireland from egg to inferno a dragon keepers guidehagrids always wanted a dragon he told me so the first time i ever met him said harrybut its against our laws said ron dragon breeding was outlawed by the warlocks convention of everyone knows that its hard to stop muggles from noticing us if were keeping dragons in the back garden anyway you cant tame dragons its dangerous you should see the burns charlies got off wild ones in romaniabut there arent wild dragons in britain said harryof course there are said ron common welsh green and hebridean blacks the ministry of magic has a job hushing them up i can tell youour kind have to keep putting spells on muggles whove spotted them to make them forgetso what on earths hagrid up to said hermionewhen they knocked on the door of the gamekeepers hut an hour later they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed hagrid called who is it before he let them in and then shut the door quickly behind themit was stifling hot inside even though it was such a warm day there was a blazing fire in the grate hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiches which they refusedso yeh wanted to ask me somethinyes said harry there was no point beating around the bush we were wondering if you could tell us whats guarding the sorcerers stone apart from fluffyhagrid frowned at himcourse i cant he said number one i don know meself number two yeh know too much already so i wouldn tell yeh if i could that stones here fer a good reason it was almost stolen outta gringotts i sppose yehve worked that out an all beats me how yeh even know abou fluffyoh come on hagrid you might not want to tell us but you do know you know everything that goes on round here said hermione in a warm flattering voice hagrids beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling we only wondered who had done the guarding really hermione went on we wondered who dumbledore had trusted enough to help him apart from youhagrids chest swelled at these last words harry and ron beamed at hermionewell i don spose it could hurt ter tell yeh that lets see he borrowed fluffy from me then some o the teachers did enchantmentsprofessor sprout professor flitwick professor mcgonagall he ticked them off on his fingers professor quirrell an dumbledore himself did somethin o course hang on ive forgotten someone oh yeah professor snapesnapeyeah yer not still on abou that are yeh look snape helped protect the stone hes not about ter steal itharry knew ron and hermione were thinking the same as he was if snape had been in on protecting the stone it must have been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded it he probably knew everything except it seemed quirrells spell and how to get past fluffyyoure the only one who knows how to get past fluffy arent you hagrid said harry anxiously and you wouldnt tell anyone would you not even one of the teachersnot a soul knows except me an dumbledore said hagrid proudlywell thats something harry muttered to the others hagrid can we have a window open im boilingcant harry sorry said hagrid harry noticed him glance at the fire harry looked at it toohagrid whats thatbut he already knew what it was in the very heart of the fire underneath the kettle was a huge black eggah said hagrid fiddling nervously with his beard thats erwhere did you get it hagrid said ron crouching over the fire to get a closer look at the egg it mustve cost you a fortunewon it said hagrid las night i was down in the village havin a few drinks an got into a game o cards with a stranger think he was quite glad ter get rid of it ter be honestbut what are you going to do with it when its hatched said hermionewell ive bin doin some readin said hagrid pulling a large book from under his pillow got this outta the library dragon breeding for pleasure and profit its a bit outta date o course but its all in here keep the egg in the fire cause their mothers breathe on i em see an when it hatches feed it on a bucket o brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour an see here how ter recognize diffrent eggs what i got theres a norwegian ridgeback theyre rare themhe looked very pleased with himself but hermione didnthagrid you live in a wooden house she saidbut hagrid wasnt listening he was humming merrily as he stoked the fireso now they had something else to worry about what might happen to hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hutwonder what its like to have a peaceful life ron sighed as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting hermione had now started making study schedules for harry and ron too it was driving them nutsthen one breakfast time hedwig brought harry another note from hagridhe had written only two words its hatchingron wanted to skip herbology and go straight down to the hut hermione wouldnt hear of ithermione how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatchingweve got lessons well get into trouble and thats nothing to what hagrids going to be in when someone finds out what hes doing shut up harry whisperedmalfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen how much had he heard harry didnt like the look on malfoys face at allron and hermione argued all the way to herbology and in the end hermione agreed to run down to hagrids with the other two during morning break when the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest hagrid greeted them looking flushed and excitedits nearly out he ushered them insidethe egg was lying on the table there were deep cracks in it something was moving inside a funny clicking noise was coming from itthey all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated breathall at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open the baby dragon flopped onto the table it wasnt exactly pretty harry thought it looked like a crumpled black umbrella its spiny wings were huge compared to its skinny jet body it had a long snout with wide nostrils the stubs of horns and bulging orange eyesit sneezed a couple of sparks flew out of its snoutisnt he beautiful hagrid murmured he reached out a hand to stroke the dragons head it snapped at his fingers showing pointed fangsbless him look he knows his mommy said hagridhagrid said hermione how fast do norwegian ridgebacks grow exactlyhagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his face he leapt to his feet and ran to the windowwhats the mattersomeone was lookin through the gap in the curtains its a kid hes runnin back up ter the schoolharry bolted to the door and looked out even at a distance there was no mistaking himmalfoy had seen the dragonsomething about the smile lurking on malfoys face during the next week made harry ron and hermione very nervous they spent most of their free time in hagrids darkened hut trying to reason with himjust let him go harry urged set him freei cant said hagrid hes too little hed diethey looked at the dragon it had grown three times in length in just a week smoke kept furling out of its nostrils hagrid hadnt been doing his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy there were empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floorive decided to call him norbert said hagrid looking at the dragon with misty eyes he really knows me now watch norbert norbert wheres mommyhes lost his marbles ron muttered in harrys earhagrid said harry loudly give it two weeks and norberts going to be as long as your house malfoy could go to dumbledore at any momenthagrid bit his lipi i know i cant keep him forever but i cant jus dump him i cantharry suddenly turned to ron charlie he saidyoure losing it too said ron im ron rememberno charlie your brother charlie in romania studying dragonswe could send norbert to him charlie can take care of him and then put him back in the wildbrilliant said ron how about it hagridand in the end hagrid agreed that they could send an owl to charlie to ask himthe following week dragged by wednesday night found hermione and harry sitting alone in the common room long after everyone else had gone to bed the clock on the wall had just chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off harrys invisibility cloak he had been down at hagrids hut helping him feed norbert who was now eating dead rats by the crateit bit me he said showing them his hand which was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief im not going to be able to hold a quill for a week i tell you that dragons the most horrible animal ive ever met but the way hagrid goes on about it youd think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit when it bit me he told me off for frightening it and when i left he was singing it a lullabythere was a tap on the dark windowits hedwig said harry hurrying to let her in shell have charlies answerthe three of them put their heads together to read the notedear ronhow are you thanks for the letter id be glad to take the norwegian ridgeback but it wont be easy getting him here i think the best thing will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week trouble is they mustnt be seen carrying an illegal dragoncould you get the ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on saturday they can meet you there and take him away while its still darksend me an answer as soon as possiblelovecharliethey looked at one anotherweve got the invisibility cloak said harry it shouldnt be too difficult i think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and norbertit was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him anything to get rid of norbert and malfoythere was a hitch by the next morning rons bitten hand had swollen to twice its usual size he didnt know whether it was safe to go to madam pomfrey would she recognize a dragon bite by the afternoon though he had no choice the cut had turned a nasty shade of green it looked as if norberts fangs were poisonousharry and hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find ron in a terrible state in bedits not just my hand he whispered although that feels like its about to fall off malfoy told madam pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me he kept threatening to tell her what really bit me ive told her it was a dog but i dont think she believes me i shouldnt have hit him at the quidditch match thats why hes doing thisharry and hermione tried to calm ron downitll all be over at midnight on saturday said hermione but this didnt soothe ron at all on the contrary he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweatmidnight on saturday he said in a hoarse voice oh no oh no ive just remembered charlies letter was in that book malfoy took hes going to know were getting rid of norbertharry and hermione didnt get a chance to answer madam pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave saying ron needed sleepits too late to change the plan now harry told hermione we havent got time to send charlie another owl and this could be our only chance to get rid of norbert well have to risk it and we have got the invisibility cloak malfoy doesnt know about thatthey found fang the boarhound sitting outside with a bandaged tail when they went to tell hagrid who opened a window to talk to themi wont let you in he puffed norberts at a tricky stage nothin i cant handlewhen they told him about charlies letter his eyes filled with tears although that might have been because norbert had just bitten him on the legaargh its all right he only got my boot jus playin hes only a baby after allthe baby banged its tail on the wall making the windows rattle harry and hermione walked back to the castle feeling saturday couldnt come quickly enoughthey would have felt sorry for hagrid when the time came for him to say goodbye to norbert if they hadnt been so worried about what they had to do it was a very dark cloudy night and they were a bit late arriving at hagrids hut because theyd had to wait for peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall where hed been playing tennis against the wall hagrid had norbert packed and ready in a large cratehes got lots o rats an some brandy fer the journey said hagrid in a muffled voice an ive packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonelyfrom inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to harry as though the teddy was having his head torn offbyebye norbert hagrid sobbed as harry and hermione covered the crate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it themselvesmommy will never forget youhow they managed to get the crate back up to the castle they never knew midnight ticked nearer as they heaved norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors up another staircase then another even one of harrys shortcuts didnt make the work much easiernearly there harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the tallest towerthen a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crateforgetting that they were already invisible they shrank into the shadows staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away a lamp flaredprofessor mcgonagall in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net had malfoy by the eardetention she shouted and twenty points from slytherin wandering around in the middle of the night how dare you you dont understand professor harry potters coming hes got a dragonwhat utter rubbish how dare you tell such lies come on i shall see professor snape about you malfoythe steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that not until theyd stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak glad to be able to breathe properly again hermione did a sort of jigmalfoys got detention i could singdont harry advised herchuckling about malfoy they waited norbert thrashing about in his crate about ten minutes later four broomsticks came swooping down out of the darknesscharlies friends were a cheery lot they showed harry and hermione the harness theyd rigged up so they could suspend norbert between themthey all helped buckle norbert safely into it and then harry and hermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very muchat last norbert was going going gonethey slipped back down the spiral staircase their hearts as light as their hands now that norbert was off them no more dragon malfoy in detention what could spoil their happiness the answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs as they stepped into the corridor filchs face loomed suddenly out of the darknesswell well well he whispered we are in troubletheyd left the invisibility cloak on top of the towerchapter fifteenthe foribidden forestthings couldnt have been worsefilch took them down to professor mcgonagalls study on the first floor where they sat and waited without saying a word to each other hermione was trembling excuses alibis and wild cover up stories chased each other around harrys brain each more feeble than the last he couldnt see how they were going to get out of trouble this time they were cornered how could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak there was no reason on earth that professor mcgonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of night let alone being up the tallest astronomy tower which was outofbounds except for classes add norbert and the invisibility cloak and they might as well be packing their bags alreadyhad harry thought that things couldnt have been worse he was wrongwhen professor mcgonagall appeared she was leading nevilleharry neville burst out the moment he saw the other two i was trying to find you to warn you i heard malfoy saying he was going to catch you he said you had a drag harry shook his head violently to shut neville up but professor mcgonagall had seen she looked more likely to breathe fire than norbert as she towered over the three of themi would never have believed it of any of you mr filch says you were up in the astronomy tower its one oclock in the morning explain yourselvesit was the first time hermione had ever failed to answer a teachers question she was staring at her slippers as still as a statuei think ive got a good idea of whats been going on said professor mcgonagall it doesnt take a genius to work it out you fed draco malfoy some cockandbull story about a dragon trying to get him out of bed and into trouble ive already caught him i suppose you think its funny that longbottom here heard the story and believed it tooharry caught nevilles eye and tried to tell him without words that this wasnt true because neville was looking stunned and hurt poor blundering neville harry knew what it must have cost him to try and find them in the dark to warn themim disgusted said professor mcgonagall four students out of bed in one night ive never heard of such a thing before you miss granger i thought you had more sense as for you mr potter i thought gryffindor meant more to you than this all three of you will receive detentions yes you too mr longbottom nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night especially these days its very dangerous and fifty points will be taken from gryffindorfifty harry gasped they would lose the lead the lead hed won in the last quidditch matchfifty points each said professor mcgonagall breathing heavily through her long pointed noseprofessor please you cant dont tell me what i can and cant do potter now get back to bed all of you ive never been more ashamed of gryffindor studentsa hundred and fifty points lost that put gryffindor in last place in one night theyd ruined any chance gryffindor had had for the house cup harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach how could they ever make up for this harry didnt sleep all night he could hear neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours harry couldnt think of anything to say to comfort him he knew neville like himself was dreading the dawn what would happen when the rest of gryffindor found out what theyd done at first gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the house points the next day thought thered been a mistake how could they suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday and then the story started to spread harry potter the famous harry potter their hero of two quidditch matches had lo st them all those points him and a couple of other stupid first yearsfrom being one of the most popular and admired people at the school harry was suddenly the most hated even ravenclaws and hufflepuffs turned on him because everyone had been longing to see slytherin lose the house cup everywhere harry went people pointed and didnt trouble to lower their voices as they insulted him slytherins on the other hand clapped as he walked past them whistling and cheering thanks potter we owe you oneonly ron stood by himtheyll all forget this in a few weeks fred and george have lost loads of points in all the time theyve been here and people still like themtheyve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go though have they said harry miserablywell no ron admittedit was a bit late to repair the damage but harry swore to himself not to meddle in things that werent his business from now on hed had it with sneaking around and spying he felt so ashamed of himself that he went to wood and offered to resign from the quidditch teamresign wood thundered what goodll that do how are we going to get any points back if we cant win at quidditchbut even quidditch had lost its fun the rest of the team wouldnt speak to harry during practice and if they had to speak about him they called him the seekerhermione and neville were suffering too they didnt have as bad a time as harry because they werent as wellknown but nobody would speak to them either hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class keeping her head down and working in silenceharry was almost glad that the exams werent far away all the studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery he ron and hermione kept to themselves working late into the night trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions learn charms and spells by heart memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellionsthen about a week before the exams were due to start harrys new resolution not to interfere in anything that didnt concern him was put to an unexpected test walking back from the library on his own one afternoon he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead as he drew closer he heard quirrells voiceno no not again please it sounded as though someone was threatening him harry moved closerall right all right he heard quirrell sobnext second quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening his turban he was pale and looked as though he was about to cry he strode out of sight harry didnt think quirrell had even noticed himhe waited until quirrells footsteps had disappeared then peered into the classroom it was empty but a door stood ajar at the other endharry was halfway toward it before he remembered what hed promised himself about not meddlingall the same hed have gambled twelve sorcerers stones that snape had just left the room and from what harry had just heard snape would be walking with a new spring in his step quirrell seemed to have given in at lastharry went back to the library where hermione was testing ron on astronomy harry told them what hed heardsnapes done it then said ron if quirrells told him how to break his antidark force spell theres still fluffy though said hermionemaybe snapes found out how to get past him without asking hagridsaid ron looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them i bet theres a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant threeheaded dog so what do we do harrythe light of adventure was kindling again in rons eyes but hermione answered before harry couldgo to dumbledore thats what we should have done ages ago if we try anything ourselves well be thrown out for surebut weve got no proof said harry quirrells too scared to back us up snapes only got to say he doesnt know how the troll got in at halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor who do you think theyll believe him or us its not exactly a secret we hate him dumbledorell think we made it up to get him sacked filch wouldnt help us if his life depended on it hes too friendly with snape and the more students get thrown out the better hell think and dont forget were not supposed to know about the stone or fluffy thatll take a lot of explaininghermione looked convinced but ron didntif we just do a bit of poking around no said harry flatly weve done enough poking aroundhe pulled a map of jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of its moonsthe following morning notes were delivered to harry hermione and neville at the breakfast table they were all the same your detention will take place at eleven oclock tonight meet mr filch in the entrance hallprofessor mcgonagall harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points theyd lost he half expected hermione to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost but she didnt say a word like harry she felt they deserved what theyd gotat eleven oclock that night they said goodbye to ron in the common room and went down to the entrance hall with neville filch was already there and so was malfoy harry had also forgotten that malfoy had gotten a detention toofollow me said filch lighting a lamp and leading them outsidei bet youll think twice about breaking a school rule again wont you eh he said leering at them oh yes hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask me its just a pity they let the old punishments die out hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days ive got the chains still in my office keep em well oiled in case theyre ever needed right off we go and dont think of running off now itll be worse for you if you dothey marched off across the dark grounds neville kept sniffing harry wondered what their punishment was going to be it must be something really horrible or filch wouldnt be sounding so delightedthe moon was bright but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them into darkness ahead harry could see the lighted windows of hagrids hut then they heard a distant shoutis that you filch hurry up i want ter get startedharrys heart rose if they were going to be working with hagrid it wouldnt be so bad his relief must have showed in his face because filch said i suppose you think youll be enjoying yourself with that oaf well think again boy its into the forest youre going and im much mistaken if youll all come out in one pieceat this neville let out a little moan and malfoy stopped dead in his tracksthe forest he repeated and he didnt sound quite as cool as usualwe cant go in there at night theres all sorts of things in there werewolves i heardneville clutched the sleeve of harrys robe and made a choking noisethats your problem isnt it said filch his voice cracking with glee shouldve thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble shouldnt youhagrid came striding toward them out of the dark fang at his heel he was carrying his large crossbow and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulderabou time he said i bin waitin fer half an hour already all right

fiercelyyehve done wrong an now yehve got ter pay fer itbut this is servant stuff its not for students to do i thought wed be copying lines or something if my father knew i was doing this hed tell yer

no one takin risks follow me over here a momenthe led them to the very edge of the forest holding his lamp up high he pointed down a narrow winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees a light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the forestlook there said hagrid see that stuff shinin on the ground silvery stuff thats unicorn blood theres a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat this is the second time in a week i found one dead last wednesday were gonna try an find the poor thing we might have ter put it out of its miseryand what if whatever hurt the unicorn

sparks right get yer wands out an practice now thats it an if anyone gets in trouble send up red sparks an well all come an find yeh so be careful lets gothe forest was black and silent a little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path and harry hermione and hagrid took the left path while malfoy neville and fang took the rightthey walked in silence their eyes on the ground every now and then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silverblue blood on the fallen leavesharry saw that hagrid looked very worriedcould a werewolf be killing the unicorns harry askednot fast enough said hagrid its not easy ter catch a unicorn theyre powerful magic creatures i never knew one ter be hurt beforethey walked past a mossy tree stump harry could hear running water there must be a stream somewhere close by there were still spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding pathyou all right hermione hagrid whispered don worry it cantve gone far if its this badly hurt an then well be able ter get behind that treehagrid seized harry and hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a towering oak he pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow raising it ready to fire the three of them listened something was slithering over dead leaves nearby it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground hagrid was squinting up the dark path but after a few seconds the sound faded awayi knew it he murmured theres summat in here that shouldn bea werewolf harry suggestedthat wasn no werewolf an it wasn no unicorn neither said hagrid grimly right follow me but careful nowthey walked more slowly ears straining for the faintest soundsuddenly in a clearing ahead something definitely movedwhos there hagrid called show yerself im armedand into the clearing came was it a man or a horse to the waist a man with red hair and beard but below that was a horses gleaming chestnut body with a long reddish tail harry and hermiones jaws droppedoh its you ronan

either of you do see anythin let me know wont yeh well be off thenharry and hermione followed him out of the clearing staring over their shoulders at ronan and bane until the trees blocked their viewnever said hagrid irritably try an get a straight answer out of a centaur ruddy stargazers not interested in anythin closern the moonare there many of them in here asked hermioneoh a fair few keep themselves to themselves mostly but theyre good enough about turnin up if ever i want a word theyre deep mind centaurs they know things jus don let on muchdyou think that was a centaur we heard earlier said harrydid that sound like hooves to you nah if yeh ask me that was whats bin killin the unicorns never heard anythin like it beforethey walked on through the dense dark trees harry kept looking nervously over his shoulder he had the nasty feeling they were being watched he was very glad they had hagrid and his crossbow with themthey had just passed a bend in the path when hermione grabbed hagrids armhagrid look red sparks the others are in troubleyou two wait here hagrid shouted stay on the path ill come back for yehthey heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking at each other very scared until they couldnt hear anything but the rustling of leaves around themyou dont think theyve been hurt do you whispered hermionei dont care if malfoy has but if somethings got neville its our fault hes here in the first placethe minutes dragged by their ears seemed sharper than usual harrys seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind every cracking twigwhat was going on where were the others at last a great crunching noise announced hagrids return malfoy neville and fang were with him hagrid was fuming malfoy it seemed had sneaked up behind neville and grabbed him as a joke neville had panicked and sent up the sparkswell be lucky ter catch anythin now with the racket you two were makin right were changin groups neville you stay with me an hermione harry you go with fang an this idiot im sorry hagrid added in a whisper to harry but hell have a harder time frightenin you an weve gotta get this doneso harry set off into the heart of the forest with malfoy and fang they walked for nearly half an hour deeper and deeper into the forest until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker there were splashes on the roots of a tree as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by harry could see a clearing ahead through the tangled branches of an ancient oaklook he murmured holding out his arm to stop malfoysomething bright white was gleaming on the ground they inched closerit was the unicorn all right and it was dead harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad its long slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearlywhite on the dark leavesharry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood a bush on the edge of the clearing quiveredthen out of the shadows a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast harry malfoy and fang stood transfixed the cloaked figure reached the unicorn lowered its head over the wound in the animals side and began to drink its bloodaaaaaaaaaarghmalfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted so did fang the hooded figure raised its head and looked right at harry unicorn blood was dribbling down its front it got to its feet and came swiftly toward harry he couldnt move for fearthen a pain like hed never felt before pierced his head it was as though his scar were on fire half blinded he staggered backward he heard hooves behind him galloping and something jumped clean over harry charging at the figurethe pain in harrys head was so bad he fell to his knees it took a minute or two to pass when he looked up the figure had gone a centaur was standing over him not ronan or bane this one looked younger he had whiteblond hair and a palomino bodyare you all right said the centaur pulling harry to his feetyes thank you what was thatthe centaur didnt answer he had astonishingly blue eyes like pale sapphires he looked carefully at harry his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out livid on harrys foreheadyou are the potter boy he said you had better get back to hagridthe forest is not safe at this time especially for you can you ride it will be quicker this waymy name is firenze he added as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that harry could clamber onto his backthere was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing ronan and bane came bursting through the trees their flanks heaving and sweatyfirenze bane thundered what are you doing you have a human on your back have you no shame are you a common muledo you realize who this is said firenze this is the potter boy the quicker he leaves this forest the betterwhat have you been telling him growled bane remember firenze we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planetsronan pawed the ground nervously im sure firenze thought he was acting for the best he said in his gloomy voicebane kicked his back legs in angerfor the best what is that to do with us centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold it is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forestfirenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger so that harry had to grab his shoulders to stay ondo you not see that unicorn firenze bellowed at bane do you not understand why it was killed or have the planets not let you in on that secret i set myself against what is lurking in this forest bane yes with humans alongside me if i mustand firenze whisked around with harry clutching on as best he could they plunged off into the trees leaving ronan and bane behind themharry didnt have a clue what was going onwhys bane so angry he asked what was that thing you saved me from anywayfirenze slowed to a walk warned harry to keep his head bowed in case of lowhanging branches but did not answer harrys question they made their way through the trees in silence for so long that harry thought firenze didnt want to talk to him anymore they were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees however when firenze suddenly stoppedharry potter do you know what unicorn blood is used forno said harry startled by the odd question weve only used the horn and tail hair in potionsthat is because it is a monstrous thing to slay a unicorn said firenze only one who has nothing to lose and everything to gain would commit such a crime the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death but at a terrible price you have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself and you will have but a halflife a cursed life from the moment the blood touches your lipsharry stared at the back of firenzes head which was dappled silver in the moonlightbut whod be that desperate he wondered aloud if youre going to be cursed forever deaths better isnt itit is firenze agreed unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else something that will bring you back to full strength and power something that will mean you can never diemr potter do you know what is hidden in the school at this very momentthe sorcerers stone of course the elixir of life but i dont understand who can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power who has clung to life awaiting their chanceit was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around harrys heart over the rustling of the trees he seemed to hear once more what hagrid had told him on the night they had met some say he diedcodswallop in my opinion dunno if he had enough human left in him to diedo you mean harry croaked that was volharry harry are you all righthermione was running toward them down the path hagrid puffing along behind herim fine said harry hardly knowing what he was saying the unicorns dead hagrid its in that clearing back therethis is where i leave you firenze murmured as hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn you are safe nowharry slid off his backgood luck harry potter said firenze the planets have been read wrongly before now even by centaurs i hope this is one of those timeshe turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest leaving harry shivering behind himron had fallen asleep in the dark common room waiting for them to return he shouted something about quidditch fouls when harry roughly shook him awake in a matter of seconds though he was wideeyed as harry began to tell him and hermione what had happened in the forestharry couldnt sit down he paced up and down in front of the fire he was still shakingsnape wants the stone for voldemort and voldemorts waiting in the forest and all this time we thought snape just wanted to get richstop saying the name said ron in a terrified whisper as if he thought voldemort could hear themharry wasnt listeningfirenze saved me but he shouldnt have done so bane was furioushe was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen they must show that voldemorts coming back bane thinks firenze should have let voldemort kill me i suppose thats written in the stars as wellwill you stop saying the name ron hissedso all ive got to wait for now is snape to steal the stone harry went on feverishly then voldemort will be able to come and finish me off well i suppose banell be happyhermione looked very frightened but she had a word of comfortharry everyone says dumbledores the only one youknowwho was ever afraid of with dumbledore around youknowwho wont touch you anyway who says the centaurs are right it sounds like fortunetelling to me and professor mcgonagall says thats a very imprecise branch of magicthe sky had turned light before they stopped talking they went to bed exhausted their throats sore but the nights surprises werent overwhen harry pulled back his sheets he found his invisibility cloak folded neatly underneath them there was a note pinned to it just in casechapter sixteenthrough the trapdoorin years to come harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment yet the days crept by and there could be no doubt that fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked doorit was sweltering hot especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers they had been given special new quills for the exams which had been bewitched with an anticheating spellthey had practical exams as well professor flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk professor mcgonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was but taken away if it had whiskers snape made them all nervous breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a forgetfulness potionharry did the best he could trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest neville thought harry had a bad case of exam nerves because harry couldnt sleep but the truth was that harry kept being woken by his old nightmare except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in itmaybe it was because they hadnt seen what harry had seen in the forest or because they didnt have scars burning on their foreheads but ron and hermione didnt seem as worried about the stone as harry the idea of voldemort certainly scared them but he didnt keep visiting them in dreams and they were so busy with their studying they didnt have much time to fret about what snape or anyone else might be up totheir very last exam was history of magic one hour of answering questions about batty old wizards whod invented selfstirring cauldrons and theyd be free free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out when the ghost of professor binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment harry couldnt help cheering with the restthat was far easier than i thought it would be said hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds i neednt have learned about the werewolf code of conduct or the uprising of elfric the eagerhermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward but ron said this made him feel ill so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree the weasley twins and lee jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid which was basking in the warm shallows no more studying ron sighed happily stretching out on the grass you could look more cheerful harry weve got a week before we find out how badly weve done theres no need to worry yetharry was rubbing his foreheadi wish i knew what this means he burst out angrily my scar keeps hurting its happened before but never as often as thisgo to madam pomfrey hermione suggestedim not ill said harry i think its a warning it means dangers comingron couldnt get worked up it was too hotharry relax hermiones right the stones safe as long as dumbledores around anyway weve never had any proof snape found out how to get past fluffy he nearly had his leg ripped off once hes not going to try it again in a hurry and neville will play quidditch for england before hagrid lets dumbledore downharry nodded but he couldnt shake off a lurking feeling that there was something hed forgotten to do something important when he tried to explain this hermione said thats just the exams i woke up last night and was halfway through my transfiguration notes before i remembered wed done that oneharry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didnt have anything to do with work though he watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky a note clamped in its mouth hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters hagrid would never betray dumbledorehagrid would never tell anyone how to get past fluffy never but harry suddenly jumped to his feetwherere you going said ron sleepilyive just thought of something said harry he had turned whiteweve got to go and see hagrid nowwhy panted hermione hurrying to keep updont you think its a bit odd said harry scrambling up the grassy slope that what hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket how many people wander around with dragon eggs if its against wizard law lucky they found hagrid dont you think why didnt i see it beforewhat are you talking about said ron but harry sprinting across the grounds toward the forest didnt answerhagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house his trousers and sleeves were rolled up and he was shelling peas into a large bowlhullo he said smiling finished yer exams got time fer a drinkyes please said ron but harry cut him offno were in a hurry hagrid ive got to ask you something you know that night you won norbert what did the stranger you were playing cards with look likedunno said hagrid casually he wouldn take his cloak offhe saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrowsits not that unusual yeh get a lot o funny folk in the hogs head thats the pub down in the village mighta bin a dragon dealer mightn he i never saw his face he kept his hood upharry sank down next to the bowl of peas what did you talk to him about hagrid did you mention hogwarts at allmighta come up said hagrid frowning as he tried to rememberyeah he asked what i did an i told him i was gamekeeper herehe asked a bit about the sorta creatures i took after so i told him an i said what id always really wanted was a dragon an then i can remember too well cause he kept buyin me drinkslets see yeah then he said he had the dragon egg an we could play cards fer it if i wanted but he had ter be sure i could handle it he didn want it ter go ter any old home so i told him after fluffy a dragon would be easyand did he did he seem interested in fluffy harry asked try ing to keep his voice calmwell yeah how many threeheaded dogs dyeh

told yeh that he blurted out forget i said it hey wherere yeh goinharry ron and hermione didnt speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall which seemed very cold and gloomy after the groundsweve got to go to dumbledore said harry hagrid told that stranger how to get past fluffy and it was either snape or voldemort under that cloak it mustve been easy once hed got hagrid drunk i just hope dumbledore believes us firenze might back us up if bane doesnt stop him wheres dumbledores officethey looked around as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction they had never been told where dumbledore lived nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see himwell just have to harry began but a voice suddenly rang across the hallwhat are you three doing insideit was professor mcgonagall carrying a large pile of bookswe want to see professor dumbledore said hermione rather bravely harry and ron thoughtsee professor dumbledore professor mcgonagall repeated as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do whyharry swallowed now what its sort of secret he said but he wished at once he hadnt because professor mcgonagalls nostrils flaredprofessor dumbledore left ten minutes ago she said coldly he received an urgent owl from the ministry of magic and flew off for london at oncehes gone said harry frantically nowprofessor dumbledore is a very great wizard potter he has many demands on his time but this is importantsomething you have to say is more important than the ministry of magic potterlook said harry throwing caution to the winds professor its about the sorcerers tone whatever professor mcgonagall had expected it wasnt that the books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms but she didnt pick them uphow do you know she splutteredprofessor i think i know that sn that someones going to try and steal the stone ive got to talk to professor dumbledoreshe eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicionprofessor dumbledore will be back tomorrow she said finally i dont know how you found out about the stone but rest assured no one can possibly steal it its too well protectedbut professor potter i know what im talking about she said shortly she bent down and gathered up the fallen books i suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshinebut they didntits tonight said harry once he was sure professor mcgonagall was out of earshot snapes going through the trapdoor tonight hes found out everything he needs and now hes got dumbledore out of the way he sent that note i bet the ministry of magic will get a real shock when dumbledore turns upbut what can we hermione gasped harry and ron wheeled roundsnape was standing theregood afternoon he said smoothlythey stared at himyou shouldnt be inside on a day like this he said with an odd twisted smilewe were harry began without any idea what he was going to sayyou want to be more careful said snape hanging around like this people will think youre up to something and gryffindor really cant afford to lose any more points can itharry flushed they turned to go outside but snape called them backbe warned potter any more nighttime wanderings and i will personally make sure you are expelled good day to youhe strode off in the direction of the staffroomout on the stone steps harry turned to the othersright heres what weve got to do he whispered urgently one of us has got to keep an eye on snape wait outside the staff room and follow him if he leaves it hermione youd better do thatwhy meits obvious said ron you can pretend to be waiting for professor flitwick you know he put on a high voice oh professor flitwick im so worried i think i got question fourteen b wrongÃ¢â‚¬Å“oh shut up said hermione but she agreed to go and watch out for snapeand wed better stay outside the thirdfloor corridor harry told roncome onbut that part of the plan didnt work no sooner had they reached the door separating fluffy from the rest of the school than professor mcgonagall turned up again and this time she lost her temperi suppose you think youre harder to get past than a pack of enchantments she stormed enough of this nonsense if i hear you ve come anywhere near here again ill take another fifty points from gryffindor yes weasley from my own house harry and ron went back to the common room harry had just said at least hermiones on snapes tail when the portrait of the fat lady swung open and hermione came inim sorry harry she wailed snape came out and asked me what i was doing so i said i was waiting for flitwick and snape went to get him and ive only just got away i dont know where snape wentwell thats it then isnt it harry saidthe other two stared at him he was pale and his eyes were glitteringim going out of here tonight and im going to try and get to the stone firstyoure mad said ronyou cant said hermione after what mcgonagall and snape have said youll be expelledso whap harry shouted dont you understand if snape gets hold of the stone voldemorts coming back havent you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over there wont be any hogwarts to get expelled from hell flatten it or turn it into a school for the dark arts losing points doesnt matter anymore cant you see dyou think hell leave you and your families alone if gryffindor wins the house cup if i get caught before i can get to the stone well ill have to go back to the dursleys and wait for voldemort to find me there its only dying a bit later than i would have because im never going over to the dark side im going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me voldemort killed my parents rememberhe glared at themyoure right harry said hermione in a small voiceill use the invisibility cloak said harry its just lucky i got it backbut will it cover all three of us said ronall all three of usoh come off it you dont think wed let you go aloneof course not said hermione briskly how do you think youd get to the stone without us id better go and took through my books there might be something usefulbut if we get caught you two will be expelled toonot if i can help it said hermione grimly flitwick told me in secret that i got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam theyre not throwing me out after thatafter dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common roomnobody bothered them none of the gryffindors had anything to say to harry any more after all this was the first night he hadnt been upset by it hermione was skimming through all her notes hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break harry and ron didnt talk much both of them were thinking about what they were about to doslowly the room emptied as people drifted off to bedbetter get the cloak ron muttered as lee jordan finally left stretching and yawning harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory he putted out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute hagrid had given him for christmas he pocketed it to use on fluffy he didnt feel much like singinghe ran back down to the common roomwed better put the cloak on here and make sure it covers all three of us if filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own what are you doing said a voice from the corner of the room neville appeared from behind an armchair clutching trevor the toad who looked as though hed been making another bid for freedomnothing neville nothing said harry hurriedly putting the cloak behind his backneville stared at their guilty facesyoure going out again he saidno no no said hermione no were not why dont you go to bed nevilleharry looked at the grandfather clock by the door they couldnt afford to waste any more time snape might even now be playing fluffy to sleepyou cant go out said neville youll be caught again gryffindor will be in even more troubleyou dont understand said harry this is importantbut neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperatei wont let you do it he said hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole ill ill fight youneville ron exploded get away from that hole and dont be an idiot dont you call me an idiot said neville i dont think you should be breaking any more rules and you were the one who told me to stand up to peopleyes but not to us said ron in exasperation neville you dont know what youre doinghe took a step forward and neville dropped trevor the toad who leapt out of sightgo on then try and hit me said neville raising his fists im readyharry turned to hermionedo something he said desperatelyhermione stepped forwardneville she said im really really sorry about thisshe raised her wandpetrificus totalus she cried pointing it at nevillenevilles arms snapped to his sides his legs sprang together his whole body rigid he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face stiff as a boardhermione ran to turn him over nevilles jaws were jammed together so he couldnt speak only his eyes were moving looking at them in horrorwhatve you done to him harry whisperedits the full bodybind said hermione miserably oh neville im so sorrywe had to neville no time to explain said harryyoull understand later neville said ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the invisibility cloakbut leaving neville lying motionless on the floor didnt feel like a very good omen in their nervous state every statues shadow looked like filch every distant breath of wind sounded like peeves swooping down on them at the foot of the first set of stairs they spotted mrs norris skulking near the topoh lets kick her just this once ron whispered in harrys ear but harry shook his head as they climbed carefully around her mrs norris turned her lamplike eyes on them but didnt do anythingthey didnt meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the third floor peeves was bobbing halfway up loosening the carpet so that people would tripwhos there he said suddenly as they climbed toward him he narrowed his wicked black eyes know youre there even if i cant see you are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastiehe rose up in the air and floated there squinting at themshould call filch i should if somethings acreeping around unseenharry had a sudden ideapeeves he said in a hoarse whisper the bloody baron has his own reasons for being invisiblepeeves almost fell out of the air in shock he caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the stairsso sorry your bloodiness mr baron sir he said greasily my mistake my mistake i didnt see you of course i didnt youre invisible forgive old peevsie his little joke siri have business here peeves croaked harry stay away from this place tonighti will sir i most certainly will said peeves rising up in the air again hope your business goes well baron ill not bother youand he scooted off brilliant harry whispered rona few seconds later they were there outside the thirdfloor corridor and the door was already ajarwell there you are harry said quietly snapes already got past fluffyseeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them underneath the cloak harry turned to the other twoif you want to go back i wont blame you he said you can take the cloak i wont need it nowdont be stupid said ronwere coming said hermioneharry pushed the door openas the door creaked low rumbling growls met their ears all three of the dogs noses sniffed madly in their direction even though it couldnt see themwhats that at its feet hermione whisperedlooks like a harp said ron snape must have left it thereit must wake up the moment you stop playing said harry well here goeshe put hagrids flute to his lips and blew it wasnt really a tune but from the first note the beasts eyes began to droop harry hardly drew breath slowly the dogs growls ceased it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees then it slumped to the ground fast asleepkeep playing ron warned harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor they could feel the dogs hot smelly breath as they approached the giant heads i think well be able to pull the door open said ron peering over the dogs back want to go first hermioneno i dontall right ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dogs legs he bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor which swung up and openwhat can you see hermione said anxiouslynothing just black theres no way of climbing down well just have to dropharry who was still playing the flute waved at ron to get his attention and pointed at himselfyou want to go first are you sure said ron i dont know how deep this thing goes give the flute to hermione so she can keep him asleepharry handed the flute over in the few seconds silence the dog growled and twitched but the moment hermione began to play it fell back into its deep sleepharry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor there was no sign of the bottomhe lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips then he looked up at ron and said if anything happens to me dont follow go straight to the owlery and send hedwig to dumbledore rightright said ronsee you in a minute i hopeand harry let go cold damp air rushed past him as he fell down down down and flump with a funny muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft he sat up and felt around his eyes not used to the gloom it felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plantits okay he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp which was the open trapdoor its a soft landing you can jumpron followed right away he landed sprawled next to harrywhats this stuff were his first wordsdunno some sort of plant thing i suppose its here to break the fallcome on hermionethe distant music stopped there was a loud bark from the dog but hermione had already jumped she landed on harrys other sidewe must be miles under the school she saidlucky this plant things here really said ronlucky shrieked hermione look at you bothshe leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall she had to struggle because the moment she had landed the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles as for harry and ron their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticinghermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them but the more they strained against it the tighter and faster the plant wound around themstop moving hermione ordered them i know what this is its devils snareoh im so glad we know what its called thats a great help snarled ron leaning back trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck shut up im trying to remember how to kill it said hermionewell hurry up i cant breathe harry gasped wrestling with it as it curled around his chestdevils snare devils snare what did professor sprout say it likes the dark and the damp so light a fire harry chokedyes of course but theres no wood hermione cried wringing her handshave you gone mad ron bellowed are you a witch or notoh right said hermione and she whipped out her wand waved it muttered something and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on snape at the plant in a matter of seconds the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmthwriggling and flailing it unraveled itself from their bodies and they were able to pull freelucky you pay attention in herbology hermione said harry as he joined her by the wall wiping sweat off his faceyeah said ron and lucky harry doesnt lose his head in a crisis theres no wood honestlythis way said harry pointing down a stone passageway which was the only way forwardall they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls the passageway sloped downward and harry was reminded of gringotts with an unpleasant jolt of the heart he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards bank if they met a dragon a fullygrown dragon norbert had been bad enoughcan you hear something ron whisperedharry listened a soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up aheaddo you think its a ghosti dont know sounds like wings to metheres light ahead i can see something movingthey reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber its ceiling arching high above them it was full of small jewelbright birds fluttering and tumbling all around the room on the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden doordo you think theyll attack us if we cross the room said ronprobably said harry they dont look very vicious but i suppose if they all swooped down at once well theres no other choice ill runhe took a deep breath covered his face with his arms and sprinted across the room he expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second but nothing happened he reached the door untouched he pulled the handle but it was lockedthe other two followed him they tugged and heaved at the door but it wouldnt budge not even when hermione tried her alohomora charmnow what said ronthese birds they cant be here just for decoration said hermionethey watched the birds soaring overhead glittering glittering theyre not birds harry said suddenly theyre keys winged keys look carefully so that must mean he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys yes look broomsticks weve got to catch the key to the doorbut there are hundreds of themron examined the lock on the doorwere looking for a big oldfashioned one probably silver like the handlethey each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys they grabbed and snatched but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch onenot for nothing though was harry the youngest seeker in a century he had a knack for spotting things other people didnt after a minutes weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyholethat one he called to the others that big one there no there with bright blue wings the feathers are all crumpled on one sideron went speeding in the direction that harry was pointing crashed into the ceiling and nearly fell off his broomweve got to close in on it harry called not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing ron you come at it from above hermione stay below and stop it from going down and ill try and catch it right nowron dived hermione rocketed upward the key dodged them both and harry streaked after it it sped toward the wall harry leaned forward and with a nasty crunching noise pinned it against the stone with one hand ron and hermiones cheers echoed around the high chamberthey landed quickly and harry ran to the door the key struggling in his hand he rammed it into the lock and turned it worked the moment the lock had clicked open the key took flight again looking very battered now that it had been caught twiceready harry asked the other two his hand on the door handle they nodded he pulled the door openthe next chamber was so dark they couldnt see anything at all but as they stepped into it light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sightthey were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard behind the black chessmen which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone facing them way across the chamber were the white pieces harry ron and hermione shivered slightly the towering white chessmen had no facesnow what do we do harry whisperedits obvious isnt it said ron weve got to play our way across the roombehind the white pieces they could see another doorhow said hermione nervouslyi think said ron were going to have to be chessmenhe walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knights horse at once the stone sprang to life the horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at rondo we er have to join you to get across the black knight nodded ron turned to the other twothis needs thinking about he said i suppose weve got to take the place of three of the black piecesharry and hermione stayed quiet watching ron think finally he said now dont be offended or anything but neither of you are that good at chess were not offended said harry quickly just tell us what to dowell harry you take the place of that bishop and hermione you next to him instead of that castlewhat about youim going to be a knight said ronthe chessmen seemed to have been listening because at these words a knight a bishop and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board leaving three empty squares that harry ron and hermione tookwhite always plays first in chess said ron peering across the boardyes looka white pawn had moved forward two squaresron started to direct the black pieces they moved silently wherever he sent them harrys knees were trembling what if they lost harry move diagonally four squares to the righttheir first real shock came when their other knight was taken the white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board where he lay quite still facedownhad to let that happen said ron looking shaken leaves you free to take that bishop hermione go onevery time one of their men was lost the white pieces showed no mercysoon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the walltwice ron only just noticed in time that harry and hermione were in danger he himself darted around the board taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black oneswere nearly there he muttered suddenly let me think let me thinkthe white queen turned her blank face toward himyes said ron softly its the only way ive got to be takennof harry and hermione shoutedthats chess snapped ron youve got to make some sacrifices i take one step forward and shell take me that leaves you free to checkmate the king harrybut do you want to stop snape or notron look if you dont hurry up hell already have the stonethere was no alternativeready ron called his face pale but determined here i go now dont hang around once youve wonhe stepped forward and the white queen pounced she struck ron hard across the head with her stone arm and he crashed to the floor hermione screamed but stayed on her square the white queen dragged ron to one side he looked as if hed been knocked outshaking harry moved three spaces to the leftthe white king took off his crown and threw it at harrys feet they had won the chessmen parted and bowed leaving the door ahead clear with one last desperate look back at ron harry and hermione charged through the door and up the next passagewaywhat if hes hell be all right said harry trying to convince himself what do you reckons nextweve had sprouts that was the devils snare flitwick mustve put charms on the keys mcgonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive that leaves quirrells spell and snapesthey had reached another doorall right harry whisperedgo onharry pushed it opena disgusting smell filled their nostrils making both of them pull their robes up over their noses eyes watering they saw flat on the floor in front of them a troll even larger than the one they had tackled out cold with a bloody lump on its headim glad we didnt have to fight that one harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs come on i cant breathehe pulled open the next door both of them hardly daring to look at what came next but there was nothing very frightening in here just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a linesnapes said harry what do we have to dothey stepped over the threshold and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway it wasnt ordinary fire either it was purple at the same instant black flames shot up in the doorway leading onwardthey were trappedlook hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles harry looked over her shoulder to read it danger lies before you while safety lies behind two of us will help you which ever you would find one among us seven will let you move ahead another will transport the drinker back instead two among our number hold only nettle wine three of us are killers waiting bidden in linechoose unless you wish to stay here forevermore to help you in your choice we give you these clues four first however slyly the poison tries to hide you will always find some on nettle wines left side second different are those who stand at either end but if you would move onward neither is your friend third as you see clearly all are different size neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides fourth the second left and the second on the right are twins once you taste them though different at first sighthermione let out a great sigh and harry amazed saw that she was smiling the very last thing he felt like doingbrilliant said hermione this isnt magic its logic a puzzlea lot of the greatest wizards havent got an ounce of logic theyd be stuck in here foreverbut so will we wont we of course not said hermione everything we need is here on this paper seven bottles three are poison two are wine one will get us safely through the black fire and one will get us back through the purplebut how do we know which to drinkgive me a minutehermione read the paper several times then she walked up and down the line of bottles muttering to herself and pointing at them at last she clapped her handsgot it she said the smallest bottle will get us through the black fire toward the stoneharry looked at the tiny bottletheres only enough there for one of us he said thats hardly one swallowthey looked at each otherwhich one will get you back through the purple flameshermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the lineyou drink that said harry no listen get back and get ron grab brooms from the flying key room theyll get you out of the trapdoor and past fluffy go straight to the owlery and send hedwig to dumbledore we need him i might be able to hold snape off for a while but im no match for him reallybut harry what if youknowwhos with himwell i was lucky once wasnt i said harry pointing at his scari might get lucky againhermiones lip trembled and she suddenly dashed at harry and threw her arms around himhermioneharry youre a great wizard you knowim not as good as you said harry very embarrassed as she let go of himme said hermione books and cleverness there are more important things friendship and bravery and oh harry be carefulyou drink first said harry you are sure which is which arent youpositive said hermione she took a long drink from the round bottle at the end and shudderedits not poison said harry anxiouslyno but its like icequick go before it wears offgood luck take caregohermione turned and walked straight through the purple fireharry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle he turned to face the black flameshere i come he said and he drained the little bottle in one gulpit was indeed as though ice was flooding his body he put the bottle down and walked forward he braced himself saw the black flames licking his body but couldnt feel them for a moment he could see nothing but dark fire then he was on the other side in the last chamberthere was already someone there but it wasnt snape it wasnt even voldemortchapter seventeenthe man with two faces it was quirrellyou gasped harryquirrell smiled his face wasnt twitching at allme he said calmly i wondered whether id be meeting you here potterbut i thought snape severus quirrell laughed and it wasnt his usual quivering treble either but cold and sharp yes severus does seem the type doesnt he so useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat next to him who would suspect pppoor ststuttering pprofessor quirrellharry couldnt take it in this couldnt be true it couldntbut snape tried to kill meno no no i tried to kill you your friend miss granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to snape at that quidditch match she broke my eye contact with you another few seconds and id have got you off that broom id have managed it before then if snape hadnt been muttering a countercurse trying to save yousnape was trying to save meof course said quirrell coolly \why do you think he wanted to referee your next match he was trying to make sure i didnt do it again funny really he neednt have bothered i couldnt do anything with dumbledore watching all the other teachers thought snape was trying to stop gryffindor from winning he did make himself unpopularand what a waste of time when after all that im going to kill you tonightquirrell snapped his fingers ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around harryyoure too nosy to live potter scurrying around the school on halloween like that for all i knew youd seen me coming to look at what was guarding the stoneyou let the troll incertainly i have a special gift with trolls you must have seen what i did to the one in the chamber back there unfortunately while everyone else was running around looking for it snape who already suspected me went straight to the third floor to head me off and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death that threeheaded dog didnt even manage to bite snapes leg off properlynow wait quietly potter i need to examine this interesting mirrorit was only then that harry realized what was standing behind quirrellit was the mirror of erisedthis mirror is the key to finding the stone quirrell murmured tapping his way around the frame trust dumbledore to come up with something like this but hes in london ill be far away by the time he gets backall harry could think of doing was to keep quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirrori saw you and snape in the forest he blurted outyes said quirrell idly walking around the mirror to look at the back he was on to me by that time trying to find out how far id gothe suspected me all along tried to frighten me as though he could when i had lord voldemort on my sidequirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into iti see the stone im presenting it to my master but where is itharry struggled against the ropes binding him but they didnt give he had to keep quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirrorbut snape always seemed to hate me so muchoh he does said quirrell casually heavens yes he was at hogwarts with your father didnt you know they loathed each other but he never wanted you deadbut i heard you a few days ago sobbing i thought snape was threatening youfor the first time a spasm of fear flitted across quirrells facesometimes he said i find it hard to follow my masters instructions he is a great wizard and i am weak you mean he was there in the classroom with you harry gaspedhe is with me wherever i go said quirrell quietly i met him when i traveled around the world a foolish young man i was then full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil lord voldemort showed me how wrong i was there is no good and evil there is only power and those too weak to seek it since then i have served him faithfully although i have let him down many times he has had to be very hard on mequirrell shivered suddenly he does not forgive mistakes easily when i failed to steal the stone from gringotts he was most displeased he punished me decided he would have to keep a closer watch on mequirrells voice trailed away harry was remembering his trip to diagon alley how could he have been so stupid hed seen quirrell there that very day shaken hands with him in the leaky cauldronquirrell cursed under his breathi dont understand is the stone inside the mirror should i break itharrys mind was racingwhat i want more than anything else in the world at the moment he thought is to find the stone before quirrell does so if i look in the mirror i should see myseff finding it which means ill see where its hidden but how can i look without quirrell realizing what im up to he tried to edge to the left to get in front of the glass without quirrell noticing but the ropes around his ankles were too tight he tripped and fell over quirrell ignored him he was still talking to himself what does this mirror do how does it work help me masterand to harrys horror a voice answered and the voice seemed to come from quirrell himself use the boy use the boyquirrell rounded on harryyes potter come herehe clapped his hands once and the ropes binding harry fell off harry got slowly to his feetcome here quirrell repeated look in the mirror and tell me what you seeharry walked toward himi must lie he thought desperately i must look and lie about what i see thats allquirrell moved close behind him harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from quirrells turban he closed his eyes stepped in front of the mirror and opened them againhe saw his reflection pale and scaredlooking at first but a moment later the reflection smiled at him it put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a bloodred stone it winked and put the stone back in its pocket and as it did so harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket somehow incredibly hed gotten the stonewell said quirrell impatiently what do you seeharry screwed up his couragei see myself shaking hands with dumbledore he invented i ive won the house cup for gryffindorquirrell cursed againget out of the way he said as harry moved aside he felt the sorcerers stone against his leg dare he make a break for it but he hadnt walked five paces before a high voice spoke though quirrell wasnt moving his lipshe lies he liespotter come back here quirrell shouted tell me the truth what did you just seethe high voice spoke againlet me speak to him facetofacemaster you are not strong enoughi have strength enough for thisharry felt as if devils snare was rooting him to the spot he couldnt move a muscle petrified he watched as quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban what was going on the turban fell away quirrells head looked strangely small without it then he turned slowly on the spotharry would have screamed but he couldnt make a sound where there should have been a back to quirrells head there was a face the most terrible face harry had ever seen it was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils like a snakeharry potter it whisperedharry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldnt movesee what i have become the face said mere shadow and vapor i have form only when i can share anothers body but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds unicorn blood has strengthened me these past weeks you saw faithful quirrell drinking it for me in the forest and once i have the elixir of life i will be able to create a body of my own now why dont you give me that stone in your pocketso he knew the feeling suddenly surged back into harrys legs he stumbled backwarddont be a fool snarled the face better save your own life and join me or youll meet the same end as your parents they died begging me for mercyliar harry shouted suddenlyquirrell was walking backward at him so that voldemort could still see him the evil face was now smilinghow touching it hissed i always value bravery yes boy your parents were brave i killed your father first and he put up a courageous fight but your mother neednt have died she was trying to protect you now give me the stone unless you want her to have died in vainneverharry sprang toward the flame door but voldemort screamed seize himand the next second harry felt quirrells hand close on his wrist at once a needlesharp pain seared across harrys scar his head felt as though it was about to split in two he yelled struggling with all his might and to his surprise quirrell let go of him the pain in his head lessened he looked around wildly to see where quirrell had gone and saw him hunched in pain looking at his fingers they were blistering before his eyesseize him seize him shrieked voldemort again and quirrell lunged knocking harry clean off his feet landing on top of him both hands around harrys neck harrys scar was almost blinding him with pain yet he could see quirrell howling in agonymaster i cannot hold him my hands my handsand quirrell though pinning harry to the ground with his knees let go of his neck and stared bewildered at his own palms harry could see they looked burned raw red and shinythen kill him fool and be done screeched voldemortquirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse but harry by instinct reached up and grabbed quirrells face aaaarghquirrell rolled off him his face blistering too and then harry knew quirrell couldnt touch his bare skin not without suffering terrible pain his only chance was to keep hold of quirrell keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curseharry jumped to his feet caught quirrell by the arm and hung on as tight as he could quirrell screamed and tried to throw harry off the pain in harrys head was building he couldnt see he could only hear quirrells terrible shrieks and voldemorts yells of kill him kill him and other voices maybe in harrys own head crying harry harryhe felt quirrells arm wrenched from his grasp knew all was lost and fell into blackness down down downsomething gold was glinting just above him the snitch he tried to catch it but his arms were too heavyhe blinked it wasnt the snitch at all it was a pair of glasses how strangehe blinked again the smiling face of albus dumbledore swam into view above himgood afternoon harry said dumbledore harry stared at him then he remembered sir the stone it was quirrell hes got the stone sir quick calm yourself dear boy you are a little behind the times said dumbledore quirrell does not have the stonethen who does sir i harry please relax or madam pomfrey will have me thrown outharry swallowed and looked around him he realized he must be in the hospital wing he was lying in a bed with white linen sheets and next to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shoptokens from your friends and admirers said dumbledore beaming what happened down in the dungeons between you and professor quirrell is a complete secret so naturally the whole school knows i believe your friends misters fred and george weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat no doubt they thought it would amuse you madam pomfrey however felt it might not be very hygienic and confiscated ithow long have i been in herethree days mr ronald weasley and miss granger will be most relieved you have come round they have been extremely worriedbut sit the stone i see you are not to be distracted very well the stone professor quirrell did not manage to take it from you i arrived in time to prevent that although you were doing very well on your own i must sayyou got there you got hermiones owlwe must have crossed in midair no sooner had i reached london than it became clear to me that the place i should be was the one i had just left i arrived just in time to pull quirrell off youit was youi feared i might be too lateyou nearly were i couldnt have kept him off the stone much longer not the stone boy you the effort involved nearly killed you for one terrible moment there i was afraid it had as for the stone it has been destroyeddestroyed said harry blankly but your friend nicolas flamel oh you know about nicolas said dumbledore sounding quite delightedyou did do the thing properly didnt you well nicolas and i have had a little chat and agreed its all for the bestbut that means he and his wife will die wont theythey have enough elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then yes they will diedumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on harrys faceto one as young as you im sure it seems incredible but to nicolas and perenelle it really is like going to bed after a very very long day after all to the wellorganized mind death is but the next great adventure you know the stone was really not such a wonderful thing as much money and life as you could want the two things most human beings would choose above all the trouble is humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them harry lay there lost for words dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceilingsir said harry ive been thinking sir even if the stones gone vol i mean youknow who call him voldemort harry always use the proper name for things fear of a name increases fear of the thing itselfyes sir well voldemorts going to try other ways of coming back isnt he i mean he hasnt gone has heno harry he has not he is still out there somewhere perhaps looking for another body to share not being truly alive he cannot be killedhe left quirrell to die he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies nevertheless harry while you may only have delayed his return to power it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time and if he is delayed again and again why he may never return to powerharry nodded but stopped quickly because it made his head hurt then he said sir there are some other things id like to know if you can tell me things i want to know the truth aboutthe truth dumbledore sighed it is a beautiful and terrible thing and should therefore be treated with great caution however i shall answer your questions unless i have a very good reason not to in which case i beg youll forgive me i shall not of course liewell voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me but why would he want to kill me in the first placedumbledore sighed very deeply this timealas the first thing you ask me i cannot tell you not today not now you will know one day put it from your mind for now harrywhen you are older i know you hate to hear this when you are ready you will knowand harry knew it would be no good to arguebut why couldnt quirrell touch meyour mother died to save you if there is one thing voldemort cannot understand it is love he didnt realize that love as powerful as your mothers for you leaves its own mark not a scar no visible sign to have been loved so deeply even though the person who loved us is gone will give us some protection forever it is in your very skin quirrell full of hatred greed and ambition sharing his soul with voldemort could not touch you for this reason it was agony to touch a person marked by something so gooddumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill which gave harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet when he had found his voice again harry said and the invisibility cloak do you know who sent it to meah your father happened to leave it in my possession and i thought you might like it dumbledores eyes twinkled useful things your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was hereand theres something elsefire awayquirrell said snape professor snape harry yes him quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father is that truewell they did rather detest each other not unlike yourself and mr malfoy and then your father did something snape could never forgivewhathe saved his lifewhatyes said dumbledore dreamily funny the way peoples minds work isnt it professor snape couldnt bear being in your fathers debti do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even then he could go back to hating your fathers memory in peaceharry tried to understand this but it made his head pound so he stoppedand sir theres one more thingjust the onehow did i get the stone out of the mirrorah now im glad you asked me that it was one of my more brilliant ideas and between you and me thats saying something you see only one who wanted to find the stone find it but not use it would be able to get it otherwise theyd just see themselves making gold or drinking elixir of life my brain surprises even me sometimes now enough questions i suggest you make a start on these sweets ah bettie botts every flavor beans i was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomitflavored one and since then im afraid ive rather lost my liking for them but i think ill be safe with a nice toffee dont youhe smiled and popped the goldenbrown bean into his mouth then he choked and said alas ear waxmadam pomfrey the nurse was a nice woman but very strictjust five minutes harry pleadedabsolutely notyou let professor dumbledore inwell of course that was the headmaster quite different you need resti am resting look lying down and everything oh go on madam pomfreyoh very well she said but five minutes onlyand she let ron and hermione inharryhermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again but harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very soreoh harry we were sure you were going to dumbledore was so worried the whole schools talking about it said ron what really happenedit was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumors harry told them everything quirrell the mirror the stone and voldemort ron and hermione were a very good audience they gasped in all the right places and when harry told them what was under quirrells turban hermione screamed out loudso the stones gone said ron finally flamels just going to diethats what i said but dumbledore thinks that what was it to the wellorganized mind death is but the next great adventurei always said he was off his rocker said ron looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero wasso what happened to you two said harrywell i got back all right said hermione i brought ron round that took a while and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall he already knew he just said harrys gone after him hasnt he and hurtled off to the third floordyou think he meant you to do it said ron sending you your fathers cloak and everythingwell hermione exploded if he did i mean to say thats terrible you could have been killedno it isnt said harry thoughtfully hes a funny man dumbledorei think he sort of wanted to give me a chance i think he knows more or less everything that goes on here you know i reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try and instead of stopping us he just taught us enough to help i dont think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked its almost like he thought i had the right to face voldemort if i couldyeah dumbledores off his rocker all right said ron proudlylisten youve got to be up for the endofyear feast tomorrow the points are all in and slytherin won of course you missed the last quidditch match we were steamrollered by ravenclaw without you but the foodll be goodat that moment madam pomfrey bustled overyouve had nearly fifteen minutes now out she said firmlyafter a good nights sleep harry felt nearly back to normali want to go to the feast he told madam pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes i can cant iprofessor dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go she said stiffily as though in her opinion professor dumbledore didnt realize how risky feasts could be and you have another visitoroh good said harry who is ithagrid sidled through the door as he spoke as usual when he was indoors hagrid looked too big to be allowed he sat down next to harry took one look at him and burst into tearsits all my ruddy fault he sobbed his face in his handsi told the evil git how ter get past fluffy i told him it was the only thing he didnt know an i told him yeh couldve died all fer a dragon egg ill never drink again i should be chucked out an made ter live as a mugglehagrid said harry shocked to see hagrid shaking with grief and remorse great tears leaking down into his beard hagrid hed have found out somehow this is voldemort were talking about hed have found out even if you hadnt told himyeh couldve died sobbed hagrid an don say the namevoldemort harry bellowed and hagrid was so shocked he stopped crying ive met him and im calling him by his name please cheer up hagrid we saved the stone its gone he cant use it have a chocolate frog ive got loadshagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said that reminds me ive got yeh a presentits not a stoat sandwich is it said harry anxiously and at last hagrid gave a weak chuckle nah dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it course he shoulda sacked me instead anyway got yeh thisit seemed to be a handsome leathercovered book harry opened it curiously it was full of wizard photographs smiling and waving at him from every page were his mother and fathersent owls off ter all yer parents old school friends askin fer photos knew yeh didn have any dyeh like itharry couldnt speak but hagrid understoodharry made his way down to the endofyear feast alone that night he had been held up by madam pomfreys fussing about insisting on giving him one last checkup so the great hall was already full it was decked out in the slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate slytherins winning the house cup for the seventh year in a row a huge banner showing the slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the high tablewhen harry walked in there was a sudden hush and then everybody started talking loudly at once he slipped into a seat between ron and hermione at the gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at himfortunately dumbledore arrived moments later the babble died awayanother year gone dumbledore said cheerfully and i must trouble you with an old mans wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast what a year it has been hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year startsnow as i understand it the house cup here needs awarding and the points stand thus in fourth place gryffindor with three hundred and twelve points in third hufflepuff with three hundred and fiftytwo ravenclaw has four hundred and twentysix and slytherin four hundred and seventy twoa storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the slytherin tableharry could see draco malfoy banging his goblet on the table it was a sickening sightyes yes well done slytherin said dumbledore however recent events must be taken into accountthe room went very still the slytherins smiles faded a littleahem said dumbledore i have a few lastminute points to dish outlet me see yesfirst to mr ronald weasleyron went purple in the face he looked like a radish with a bad sunburnfor the bestplayed game of chess hogwarts has seen in many years i award gryffindor house fifty pointsgryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling the stars overhead seemed to quiver percy could be heard telling the other prefects my brother you know my youngest brother got past mcgonagalls giant chess setat last there was silence againsecond to miss hermione granger for the use of cool logic in the face of fire i award gryffindor house fifty pointshermione buried her face in her arms harry strongly suspected she had burst into tears gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves they were a hundred points up third to mr harry potter said dumbledore the room went deadly quiet for pure nerve and outstanding courage i award gryffindor house sixty pointsthe din was deafening those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that gryffindor now had four hundred and seventytwo points exactly the same as slytherin they had tied for the house cup if only dumbledore had given harry just one more pointdumbledore raised his hand the room gradually fell silentthere are all kinds of courage said dumbledore smiling it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies but just as much to stand up to our friends i therefore award ten points to mr neville longbottomsomeone standing outside the great hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place so loud was the noise that erupted from the gryffindor table harry ron and hermione stood up to yell and cheer as neville white with shock disappeared under a pile of people hugging him he had never won so much as a point for gryffindor beforeharry still cheering nudged ron in the ribs and pointed at malfoy who couldnt have looked more stunned and horrified if hed just had the bodybind curse put on himwhich means dumbledore called over the storm of applause for even ravenclaw and hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of slytherin we need a little change of decorationhe clapped his hands in an instant the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold the huge slytherin serpent vanished and a towering gryffindor lion took its place snape was shaking professor mcgonagalls hand with a horrible forced smile he caught harrys eye and harry knew at once that snapes feelings toward him hadnt changed one jot this didnt worry harry it seemed as though life would be back to normal next year or as normal as it ever was at hogwartsit was the best evening of harrys life better than winning at quidditch or christmas or knocking out mountain trolls he would never ever forget tonightharry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come but come they did to their great surprise both he and ron passed with good marks hermione of course had the best grades of the first years even neville scraped through his good herbology mark making up for his abysmal potions one they had hoped that goyle who was almost as stupid as he was mean might be thrown out but he had passed too it was a shame but as ron said you couldnt have everything in lifeand suddenly their wardrobes were empty their trunks were packed nevilles toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets notes were handed out to all students warning them not to use magic over the holidays i always hope theyll forget to give us these said fred weasley sadly hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake they were boarding the hogwarts express talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier eating bettie botts every flavor beans as they sped past muggle towns pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats pulling into platform nine and threequarters at kings cross stationit took quite a while for them all to get off the platform a wizened old guard was up by the ticket barrier letting them go through the gate in twos and threes so they didnt attract attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarming the mugglesyou must come and stay this summer said ron both of you ill send you an owlthanks said harry ill need something to look forward to people jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway

aunt who wastrying to heave dudley to his feetall right said harry all right uncle vernon sat back down breathing like a winded rhinoceros andwatching harry closely out of the corners of his small sharp eyesever since harry had come home for the summer holidays unclevernon had been treating him like a bomb that might go off at anymoment because harry potter wasnt a normal boy as a matter offact he was as not normal as it is possible to beharry potter was a wizard a wizard fresh from his first year athogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry and if the dursleyswere unhappy to have him back for the holidays it was nothing to howharry felthe missed hogwarts so much it was like having a constantstomachache he missed the castle with its secret passageways andghosts his classes though perhaps not snape the potions master themail arriving by owl eating banquets in the great hall sleeping in hisfourposter bed in the tower dormitory visiting the gamekeeperhagrid in his cabin next to

called mugglesnot a drop of magical blood in their veinsand as far as they were concerned having a wizard in the family wasa matter of deepest shame uncle vernon had even padlockedharrys owl hedwig inside her cage to stop her from carryingmessages to anyone in the wizarding worldharry looked nothing like the rest of the family uncle vernon waslarge and neckless with an enormous black mustache aunt petuniawas horsefaced and bony dudley was blond pink and porky harryon the other hand was small and skinny with brilliant green eyes andjetblack hair that was always untidy he wore round glasses and onhis forehead was a thin lightningshaped scarit was this scar that made harry so particularly unusual even for awizard this scar was the only hint of harrys very mysterious past ofthe reason he had been left on the dursleys doorstep eleven yearsbeforeat the age of one year old harry had somehow survived a curse fromthe greatest dark sorcerer of all time lord voldemort whose namemost witches and wizards still feared to speak harrys parents haddied in voldemorts attack but harry had escaped with his lightningscar and somehow nobody understood why voldemorts powers hadbeen destroyed the instant he had failed to kill harryso harry had been brought up by his dead mothers sister and herhusband he had spent ten years with the dursleys neverunderstanding why he kept making odd things happen without meaningto believing the dursleys story that he had got his scar in the carcrash that had killed his parentsand then exactly a year ago hogwarts had written to harryand the whole story had come out harry had taken up his place atwizard school where he and his scar were famous but now theschool year was over and he was back with the dursleys for thesummer back to being treated like a

beetles that stopped them from locking him in thecupboard under the stairs with his wand and broomstick for the firstcouple of weeks back harry had enjoyed muttering nonsense wordsunder his breath and watching dudley tearing out of the room as fastas his fat legs would carry him but the long silence from ron andhermione had made harry feel so cut off from the magical world thateven taunting dudley had lost its appeal and now ron and hermionehad forgotten his birthdaywhat wouldnt he give now for a message from hogwarts from anywitch or wizard hed almost be glad of a sight of his archenemydraco malfoy just to be sure it hadnt all been a dream not that his whole year at hogwarts had been fun at the very end oflast term harry had come facetoface with none other than lordvoldemort himself voldemort might be a ruin of his former self buthe was still terrifying still cunning still determined to regain powerharry had slipped through voldemorts clutches for a second time butit had been a narrow escape and even now weeks later harry keptwaking in the night drenched in cold sweat wondering wherevoldemort was now remembering his livid face his wide mad eyesharry suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench he had beenstaring absentmindedly into the hedge and the hedge was staring backtwo enormous green eyes had appeared among the leavesharry jumped to his feet just as a jeering voice

catflapin the bedroom door so that small amounts of food could bepushed inside three times a day they let harry out to use thebathroom morning and evening otherwise he was locked in his roomaround the clockthree days later the dursleys were showing no sign of relenting andharry couldnt see any way out of his situation he lay on his bedwatching the sun sinking behind the bars on the window and wonderedmiserably what was going to happen to himwhat was the good of magicking himself out of his room if hogwartswould expel him for doing it yet life at privet drive had reached analltime low now that the dursleys knew they werent going to wakeup as fruit bats he had lost his only weapon dobby might have savedharry from horrible happenings at hogwarts but the way things weregoing hed probably starve to death anywaythe catflap rattled and aunt petunias hand appeared pushing a bowlof canned soup into the room harry whose insides were aching withhunger jumped off his bed and seized it the soup was stonecold buthe drank half of it in one gulp then he crossed the room to hedwigscage and tipped the soggy vegetables at the bottom of the bowl intoher empty food tray she ruffled her feathers and gave him a look ofdeep disgustits no good turning your beak up at it thats all weve got saidharry grimlyhe put the empty bowl back on the floor next to the catflap and layback down on the bed

that he was on show in a zoo with a card readingunderage wizard attached to his cage people goggled through the barsat him as he lay starving and weak on a bed of straw he sawdobbys face in the crowd and shouted out asking for help but dobbycalled harry potter is safe there sir and vanished then thedursleys appeared and dudley rattled the bars of the cage laughing athimstop it harry muttered as the rattling pounded in his sore headleave me alone cut it out im trying to sleep he opened his eyes moonlight was shining through the bars on thewindow and someone was goggling through the bars at him a frecklefacedredhaired longnosed someoneron weasley was outside harrys windowhh a p t e rr t h rr e ethe burrowronl breathed harry creeping to the window and pushing it up sothey could talk

treestouchdown said fred as with a slight bump they hit the groundthey had landed next to a tumbledown garage in a small yard andharry looked out for the first time at rons houseit looked as though it had once been a large stone pigpen but extrarooms had been added here and there until it was several stories highand so crooked it looked as though it were held up by magic whichharry reminded himself it probably was four or five chimneys wereperched on top of the red roof a lopsided sign stuck in the groundnear the entrance read the burrow around the front door lay a jumbleof rubber boots and a very rusty cauldron several fat brown chickenswere pecking their way around the yardits not much said ronits wonderful said harry happily thinking of privet drivethey got out of the carnow well go

harry dear she said come in andhave some breakfastshe turned and walked back into the house and harry after a nervousglance at ron who nodded encouragingly followed herthe kitchen was small and rather cramped there was ascrubbed wooden table and chairs in the middle and harry sat downon the edge of his seat looking around he had never been in a wizardhouse beforethe clock on the wall opposite him had only one hand and no numbersat all written around the edge were things like time to make tea timeto feed the chickens and youre late books were stacked three deep onthe mantelpiece books with titles like charm your own cheeseenchantment in baking and one minute feasts its magic and unlessharrys ears were deceiving him the old radio next to the sink had justannounced that coming up was witching hour with the popularsinging sorceress celestina warbeckmrs weasley was clattering around cooking breakfast a littlehaphazardly throwing dirty looks at her sons as she threw sausagesinto the frying pan every now and then she muttered things like dontknow what you were thinking of and never would have believed iti dont blame you dear she assured harry tipping eight or ninesausages onto his plate arthur and i have been worried about youtoo just last night we were saying wed come and get you ourselves ifyou hadnt written back to ron by friday but really she was nowadding three fried eggs to his plate flying an illegal car halfwayacross the country anyone could have seen you she flicked her wand casually at the dishes in the sink which began toclean themselves clinking gently in the backgroundit was cloudy mum said fredyou keep your mouth closed while youre eating mrs weasleysnappedthey were starving him mum said georgeand you said mrs weasley but it was with a slightly softenedexpression that she started cutting harry bread and buttering it forhimat that moment there was a diversion in the form of a smallredheaded figure in a long nightdress who appeared in the kitchengave a small squeal and ran out againginny said ron in an undertone to harry my sister shes beentalking about you all summeryeah shell be wanting your autograph harry fred said with a grinbut he caught his mothers eye and bent his face over his plate withoutanother word nothing more was said until all four plates were cleanwhich took a surprisingly short timeblimey im tired yawned fred setting down his knife and fork at lasti think ill go to bed and you will not snapped mrs weasley its your own fault youvebeen up all night youre going to degnome the garden for me theyregetting completely out of hand again oh mum and you two she said glaring at ron and fred you can go up tobed dear she added to harry you didnt ask them to fly thatwretched car but harry who felt wide awake said quickly ill help ron ivenever seen a degnoming thats very sweet of you dear but its dull work said mrs weasleynow lets see what lockharts got to say on the subject and she pulled a heavy book from the stack on the mantelpiecegeorge groanedmum we know how to degnome a garden harry looked at the cover of mrs weasleys book written across itin fancy gold letters were the words gilderoy lockharts guide tohousehold pests there was a big photograph on the front of a very goodioiking wizard with wavy blond hair and bright blue eyes as alwaysin the wizarding world the photograph was moving the wizard whoharry supposed was gilderoy lockhart kept winking cheekily up atthem all mrs weasley beamed down at himoh he is marvelous she said he knows his household pests allright its a wonderful book mum fancies him said fred in a very audible whisperdont be so ridiculous fred said mrs weasley her cheeks ratherpink all right if you think you know better than lockhart you can goand get on with it and woe betide you if theres a single gnome in thatgarden when i come out to inspect ityawning and grumbling the weasleys slouched outside with harrybehind them the garden was large and in harrys eyes exactlywhat a garden should be the dursleys wouldnt have liked it therewere plenty of weeds and the grass needed cutting but there weregnarled trees all around the walls plants harry had never seen spillingfrom every flower bed and a big green pond full of frogsmuggles have garden gnomes too you know harry told ronthey crossed the lawnyeah ive seen those things they think are gnomes said ron bentdouble with his head in a peony bush like fat little santa clauses withfishing rods there was a violent scuffling noise the peony bush shuddered andron straightened up this is a gnome he said grimlygerroff me gerroff me squealed the gnomeit was certainly nothing like santa claus it was small and leatherylooking with a large knobby bald head exactly like a potato ron heldit at arms length as it kicked out at him with its horny little feet hegrasped it around the ankles and turned it upside downthis is what you have to do he said he raised the gnome above hishead gerroff me and started to swing it in great circles like alasso seeing the shocked look on harrys face ron added it doesnthurt them youve just got to make them really dizzy so they cant findtheir way back to the gnomeholeshe let go of the gnomes ankles it flew twenty feet into the air andlanded with a thud in the field over the hedgepitiful said fred i bet i can get mine beyond that stumpharry learned quickly not to feel too sorry for the gnomes he decidedjust to drop the first one he caught over the hedge but the gnomesensing weakness sank its razorsharp teeth into harrys finger and hehad a hard job shaking it off untilwow harry that mustve been fifty feet the air was soon thick with flying gnomessee theyre not too bright said george seizing five or six gnomes atonce the moment they know the degnomings going on they stormup to have a look youd think theyd have learned by now just to stayputsoon the crowd of gnomes in the field started walking away in astraggling line their little shoulders hunchedtheyll be back said ron as they watched the gnomes disappear intothe hedge on the other side of the field they love it here dadstoo soft with them he thinks theyre funny just then the front door slammedhes back said george dads homethey hurried through the garden and back into the housemr weasley was slumped in a kitchen chair with his glasses off andhis eyes closed he was a thin man going bald but the little hair hehad was as red as any of his childrens he was wearing long greenrobes which were dusty and travelwornwhat a night he mumbled groping for the teapot as they all satdown around him nine raids nine and old mundungus fletchertried to put a hex on me when i had my back turned mr weasley took a long gulp of tea and sighedfind anything dad said fred eagerlyall i got were a few shrinking door keys and a biting kettle yawnedmr weasley there was some pretty nasty stuff that wasnt mydepartment though mortlake was taken away for questioning aboutsome extremely odd ferrets but thats the committee on experimentalcharms thank goodness why would anyone bother making door keys shrink said georgejust mugglebaiting sighed mr weasley sell them a key thatkeeps shrinking to nothing so they can never find it when they need itof course its very hard to convict anyone because no mugglewould admit their key keeps shrinking theyll insist they just keeplosing it bless them theyll go to any lengths to ignore magic even ifits staring them in the face but the things our lot have taken toenchanting you wouldnt believe like cars for instancemrs weasley had appeared holding a long poker like a sword mrweasleys eyes jerked open he stared guiltily at his wifeccars molly dearyes arthur cars said mrs weasley her eyes flashing imagine awizard buying a rusty old car and telling his wife all he wanted to dowith it was take it apart to see how it worked while really he wasenchanting it to make it flymr weasley blinkedwell dear i think youll find that he would be quite within the law todo that even if er he maybe would have done better to um tell hiswife the truth theres a loophole in the law youll find as longas he wasnt intending to fly the car the fact that the car could flywouldnt arthur weasley you made sure there was a loophole when youwrote that law shouted mrs weasley just so you could carry ontinkering with all that muggle rubbish in your shed and for yourinformation harry arrived this morning in the car you werentintending to flyharry said mr weasley blankly harry whohe looked around saw harry and jumpedgood lord is it harry potter very pleased to meet you rons told usso much about your sons flew that car to harrys house and back last nightshouted mrs weasley what have you got to say about that ehdid you really said mr weasley eagerly did it go all right i imean he faltered as sparks flew from mrs weasleys eyes that that was very wrong boys very wrong indeed lets leave them to it ron muttered to harry as mrs weasleyswelled like a bullfrog come on ill show you my bedroomthey slipped out of the kitchen and down a narrow passageway to anuneven staircase which wound its way zigzagging upthrough the house on the third landing a door stood ajar harry justcaught sight of a pair of bright brown eyes staring at him before itclosed with a snapginny said ron you dont know how weird it is for her to be thisshy she never shuts up normally they climbed two more flights until they reached a door with peelingpaint and a small plaque on it saying ronalds roomharry stepped in his head almost touching the sloping ceiling andblinked it was like walking into a furnace nearly everything in ronsroom seemed to be a violent shade of orange the bedspread thewalls even the ceiling then harry realized that ron had coverednearly every inch of the shabby wallpaper with posters of the sameseven witches and wizards all wearing bright orange robes carryingbroomsticks and waving energeticallyyour quidditch team said harrythe chudley cannons said ron pointing at the orange bedspreadwhich was emblazoned with two giant black cs and a speedingcannonball ninth in the leaguerons school spellbooks were stacked untidily in a corner next to apile of comics that all seemed to feature the adventures of martinmiggs the mad muggle rons magic wand was lying on top of a fishtank full of frog spawn on the windowsill next to his fat gray ratscabbers who was snoozing in a patch of sunharry stepped over a pack of selfshuffling playing cards on the floorand looked out of the tiny window in the field far below he could seea gang of gnomes sneaking one by one back through the weasleyshedge then he turned to look at ron who was watching him almostnervously as though waiting for his opinionits a bit small said ron quickly not like that room you hadwith the muggles and im right underneath the ghoul in the attiches always banging on the pipes and groaning but harry grinning widely said this is the best house ive everbeen inrons ears went pink c h a p t e r v o u rat f l v rr hand blottsife at the burrow was as different as possible from life on privetdrive the dursleys liked everything neat and ordered the weasleyshouse burst with the strange and unexpected harry got a shock thefirst time he looked in the mirror over the kitchen mantelpiece and itshouted tuck your shirt in scruffy the ghoul in the attic howledand dropped pipes whenever he felt things were getting too quiet andsmall explosions from fred and georges bedroom were consideredperfectly normal what harry found most unusual about life at ronshowever wasnt the talking mirror or the clanking ghoul it was thefact that everybody there seemed to like himmrs weasley fussed over the state of his socks and tried to force himto eat fourth helpings at every meal mr weasley liked harry to sitnext to him at the dinner table so that he could bombard him withquestions about life with muggles asking him to explain how thingslike plugs and the postal service workedfascinating he would say as harry talked him through using atelephone ingenious really how many ways muggles have found ofgetting along without magicharry heard from hogwarts one sunny morning about a week after hehad arrived at the burrow he and ron went down to breakfast to findmr and mrs weasley and ginny already sitting at the kitchen tablethe moment she saw harry ginny accidentally knocked her porridgebowl to the floor with a loud clatter ginny seemed very prone toknocking things over whenever harry entered a room she dived underthe table to retrieve the bowl and emerged with her face glowing likethe setting sun pretending he hadnt noticed this harry sat down andtook the toast mrs weasley offered himletters from school said mr weasley passing harry and ronidentical envelopes of yellowish parchment addressed in green inkdumbledore already knows youre here harry doesnt miss a trickthat man you twove got them too he added as fred and georgeambled in still in their pajamasfor a few minutes there

coming yearsecondyear students will requirethe standard book of spells grade by miranda goshawkbreak with a banshee by gilderoy lockhartgadding with ghouls by gilderoy lockhartholidays with hags by

finished his own list peered over at harrysyouve been told to get all lockharts books too he said the newdefense against the dark arts teacher must be a fan bet its awitchat this point fred caught his mothers eye and quickly busied himselfwith the marmaladethat lot wont come cheap said george with a quick look at hisparents lockharts books are really expensive well well manage said mrs weasley but she looked worried iexpect well be able to pick up a lot of ginnys things secondhandoh are you starting at hogwarts this year harry asked ginnyshe nodded blushing to the roots of her flaming hair and put herelbow in the butter dish fortunately no one saw this except harrybecause just then rons elder brother percy walked in he wasalready dressed his hogwarts prefect badge pinned to his sweatervestmorning all said percy briskly lovely dayhe sat down in the only remaining chair but leapt up again almostimmediately pulling from underneath him a moulting gray featherduster at least that was what harry thought it was until he saw thatit was breathingerrol said ron taking the limp owl from percy and extracting aletter from under its wing finally hes got hermiones answer iwrote to her saying we were going to try and rescue you from thedursleyshe carried errol to a perch just inside the back door and tried tostand him on it but errol flopped straight off again so ron lay him onthe draining board instead muttering pathetic then he rippedopen hermiones letter and read it out louddear ron and harry if youre therei hope everything went all right and that harry is okay and thatyou didnt do anything illegal to get him out ron because that wouldget harry into trouble too ive been really worried and if harry is allright will you please let me know at once but perhaps it would be

thatblocked it from view of the village below meaning that they couldpractice quidditch there as long as they didnt fly too highthey couldnt use real quidditch balls which would have been hard toexplain if they had escaped and flown away over the village insteadthey threw apples for one another to catch they took turns ridingharrys nimbus two thousand which was easily the best broomrons old shooting star was often outstripped by passing butterfliesfive minutes later they were marching up the hill broomsticks overtheir shoulders they had asked percy if he wanted to join them buthe had said he was busy harry had only seen percy at mealtimes sofar he stayed shut in his room the rest of the timewish i knew what he was up to said fred frowning hes nothimself his exam results came the

course it was only in the wizarding world that he hadmoney you couldnt use galleons sickles and knutsin muggle shops he had never mentioned his gringotts bank accountto the dursleys he didnt think their horror of anything connected withmagic would stretch to a large pile of goldmrs weasley woke them all early the following wednesday after aquick half a dozen bacon sandwiches each they pulled on their coatsand mrs weasley took a flowerpot off the kitchen mantelpiece andpeered insidewere running low arthur she sighed well have to buy somemore today ah well guests first after you harry dearand

he took a deep breath scatteredthe powder into the flames and stepped forward the fire felt like awarm breeze he opened his mouth and immediately swallowed a lotof hot ashddiagon alley he coughedit felt as though he was being sucked down a giant drain he seemedto be spinning very fast the roaring in his ears was deafening hetried to keep his eyes open but the whirl of green flames made himfeel sick something hard knocked his elbow and he tucked it intightly still spinning and spinning now it felt as though cold handswere slapping his face squinting through his glasses he saw a blurredstream of fireplaces and snatched glimpses of the rooms beyond hisbacon sandwiches were churning inside him he closed his eyes againwishing it would stop and thenhe fell face forward onto cold stone and felt the bridge of his glassessnapdizzy and bruised covered in soot he got gingerly to his feet holdinghis broken glasses up to his eyes he was cite alone but where hewas he had no idea all he could tell was that he was standing in thestone fireplace of what looked like a large dimly lit wizards shop butnothing in here was ever likely to be on a hogwarts school lista glass case nearby held a withered hand on a cushion a bloodstainedpack of cards and a staring glass eye evillooking masks stared downfrom the walls an assortment of human bones lay upon the counterand rusty spiked instruments hung from the ceiling even worse thedark narrow street harry could see through the dusty shop windowwas definitely not diagon alleythe sooner he got out of here the better nose still stinging where ithad hit the hearth harry made his way swiftly and silently toward thedoor but before hed got halfway toward it two people appeared onthe other side of the glass and one of them was thevery last person harry wanted to meet when he was lost covered insoot and wearing broken glasses draco malfoyharry looked quickly around and spotted a large black cabinet to hisleft he shot inside it and pulled the doors closed leaving a small crackto peer through seconds later a bell clanged and malfoy stepped intothe shopthe man who followed could only be dracos father he had the samepale pointed face and identical cold gray eyes mr malfoy crossedthe shop looking lazily at the items on display and rang a bell on thecounter before turning to his son and saying touch nothing dracomalfoy who had reached for the glass eye said i thought you weregoing to buy me a presenti said i would buy you a racing broom said his father drumming hisfingers on the counterwhats the good of that if im not on the house

cabinet past the glass cases and out of the shopdoorclutching his broken glasses to his face harry stared around he hademerged into a dingy alleyway that seemed to be made up entirely ofshops devoted to the dark arts the one hed just left borgin andburkes looked like the largest but opposite was a nasty windowdisplay of shrunken heads and two doors down a large cage wasalive with gigantic black spiders two shabbylooking wizards werewatching him from the shadow of a doorway muttering to each otherfeeling jumpy harry set off trying to hold his glasses on straight andhoping against hope hed be

though he wanted to stop them leaving but he barelycame up to hagrids waist and seemed to think better of it they hurried up thestreet the grangers shaking with fright and mrs weasley beside herself withfurya fine example to set for your children brawling in public whatgilderoy lockhart mustve thought he was pleased said fred didnt you hear him as we were leaving he wasasking that bloke from the daily prophet if hed be able to work the fight intohis report said it was all publicity but it was a subdued group that headed back to the fireside in the leakycauldron where harry the weasleys and all their shopping would betraveling back to the burrow using floo powder they said goodbye to thegrangers who were leaving the pub for the muggle street on the other sidemr weasley started to askthem how bus stops worked but stopped quickly at the look on mrsweasleys faceharry took off his glasses and put them safely in his pocket beforehelping himself to floo powder it definitely wasnt his favorite way totravelc hh a p t e rr f i v ethe whompingwillowhe end of the summer vacation came too quickly for harrys likinghe was looking forward to getting back to hogwarts but his monthat the burrow had been the happiest of his life it was difficult not tofeel jealous of ron when he thought of the dursleys and the sort ofwelcome he could expect next time he turned up on privet driveon their last evening mrs weasley conjured up a sumptuous dinnerthat included all of harrys favorite things ending with amouthwatering treacle pudding fred and george rounded off theevening with a display of filibuster fireworks they fiiled the kitchenwith red and blue stars that bounced from ceiling to wall for at leasthalf an hour then it was time for a last mug of hot chocolate andbedit took a long while to get started next morning they were up atdawn but somehow they still seemed to have a great deal to domrs weasley dashed about in a bad mood looking for spare socks andquills people kept colliding on the stairs halfdressed with bits of toastin their hands and mr weasley nearly broke his neck tripping over astray chicken as he crossed the yard carrying ginnys trunk to the carharry couldnt see how eight people six large trunks two owls and arat were going to fit into one small ford anglia he had reckoned ofcourse without the special features that mr weasley had addednot a word to molly he whispered to harry as he opened the trunkand showed him how it had been magically expanded so that theluggage fitted easilywhen at last they were all in the car mrs weasley glanced into theback seat where harry ron fred george and percy were all sittingcomfortably side by side and said muggles do know more than wegive them credit for dont they she and ginny got into the front seatwhich had been stretched so that it resembled a park bench i meanyoud never know it was this roomy from the outside would youmr weasley started up the engine and they trundled out of the yardharry turning back for a last look at the house he barely had time towonder when hed see it again when they were back george hadforgotten his box of filibuster fireworks five minutes after that theyskidded to a halt in the yard so that fred could run in for hisbroomstick they had almost reached the highway when ginnyshrieked that shed left her diary by the time she had clambered backinto the car they were running very late and tempers were runninghighmr weasley glanced at his watch and then at his wifemolly dear no arthur no one would see this little button here is an invisibility booster iinstalled thatd get us up in the air then we fly above the cloudswed be there in ten minutes and no one would be any the wiser i said no arthur not in broad daylight they reached kings cross at a quarter to eleven mr weasleydashed across the road to get trolleys for their trunks and they allhurried into the stationharry had caught the hogwarts express the previous year the trickypart was getting onto platform nine and threequarters which wasntvisible to the muggle eye what you had to do was walk through thesolid barrier dividing platforms nine and ten it didnt hurt but it had tobe done carefully so that none of the muggles noticed you vanishingpercy first said mrs weasley looking nervously at the clockoverhead which showed they had only five minutes to disappearcasually through the barrierpercy strode briskly forward and vanished mr weasley went nextfred and george followedill take ginny and you two come right after us mrs weasley toldharry and ron grabbing ginnys hand and setting off in the blink ofan eye they were gonelets go together weve only got a minute ron said to harryharry made sure that hedwigs cage was safely wedged on top of histrunk and wheeled his trolley around to face the barrier he feltperfectly confident this wasnt nearly as uncomfortable as using floopowder both of them bent low over the handles of their trolleys andwalked purposefully toward the barrier gathering speed a few feetaway from it they broke into a run andcrashboth trolleys hit the barrier and bounced backward rons trunk felloff with a loud thump harry was knocked off his feet and hedwigscage bounced onto the shiny floor and she rolled away shriekingindignantly people all around them stared and a guard nearby yelledwhat in blazes dyou think youre doinglost control of the trolley harry gasped clutching his ribs as hegot up ron ran to pick up hedwig who was causing such a scenethat there was a lot of muttering about cruelty to animals from thesurrounding crowdwhy cant we get through harry hissed to roni dunno ron looked wildly around a dozen curious people were stillwatching themwere going to miss the train ron whispered i dont understandwhy the gateways sealed itself harry looked up at the giant clock with a sickening feeling in the pitof his stomach ten seconds nine seconds he wheeled his trolley forward cautiously until it was right against thebarrier and pushed with all his might the metal remained solidthree seconds two seconds one second its gone said ron sounding stunned the trains left what ifmum and dad cant get back through to us have you got anymuggle moneyand they marched off through the crowd of curious muggles out ofthe station and back onto the side road where the old ford anglia wasparkedron unlocked the cavernous trunk with a series of taps from his wandthey heaved their luggage back in put hedwig on the back seat andgot into the frontcheck that no ones watching said ron starting the ignition withanother tap of his wand harry stuck his head out of the windowtraffic was rumbling along the main road ahead but their street wasemptyokay he saidron pressed a tiny silver button on the dashboard the car aroundthem vanished and so did they harry could feel the seat vibratingbeneath him hear the engine feel his hands on his knees and hisglasses on his nose but for all he could see he had become a pair ofeyeballs floating a few feet above the ground in a dingy street full ofparked carslets go said rons voice from his rightand the ground and the dirty buildings on either side fell awaydropping out of sight as the car rose in seconds the whole of londonlay smoky and glittering below themthen there was a popping noise and the car harry and ronreappeareduhoh said ron jabbing at the invisibility booster its faulty both of them pummeled it the car vanished then it flickered backagainhold on ron yelled and he slammed his foot on the accelerator they shot straight into the low woolly clouds and everythingturned dull and foggynow what said harry blinking at the solid mass of cloud pressingin on them from all sideswe need to see the train to know what direction to go in said rondip back down again quickly they dropped back beneath the clouds and twisted around in theirseats squinting at the groundi can see it harry yelled right ahead therethe hogwarts express was streaking along below them like a scarletsnakedue north said ron checking the compass on the dashboardokay well just have to check on it every half hour or so hold onand they shot up through the clouds a minute later they burst outinto a blaze of sunlightit was a different world the wheels of the car skimmed the sea offluffy cloud the sky a bright endless blue under the blinding white sunall weve got to worry about now are airplanes said ronthey looked at each other and started to laugh for a long time theycouldnt stopit was as though they had been plunged into a fabulous dream thisthought harry was surely the only way to travel past swirls andturrets of snowy cloud in a car full of hot bright sunlight with a fatpack of toffees in the glove compartment and the prospect of seeingfreds and georges jealous faces when theylanded smoothly and spectacularly on the sweeping lawn in front ofhogwarts castlethey made regular checks on the train as they flew farther andfarther north each dip beneath the clouds showing them a differentview london was soon far behind them replaced by neat greenfields that gave way in turn to wide purplish moors a great city alivewith cars like multicolored ants villages with tiny toy churchesseveral uneventful hours later however harry had to admit thatsome of the fun was wearing off the toffees had made themextremely thirsty and they had nothing to drink he and ron hadpulled off their sweaters but harrys tshirt was sticking to the backof his seat and his glasses kept sliding down to the end of his sweatynose he had stopped noticing the fantastic cloud shapes now andwas thinking longingly of the train miles below where you could buyicecold pumpkin juice from a trolley pushed by a plump witch whyhadnt they been able to get onto platform nine and threequarterscant be much further can it croaked ron hours later still as thesun started to sink into their floor of cloud staining it a deep pinkready for another check on the trainit was still right below them winding its way past a snowcappedmountain it was much darker beneath the canopy of cloudsron put his foot on the accelerator and drove them upward againbut as he did so the engine began to whineharry and ron exchanged nervous glancesits probably just tired said ron its never been this far beforeand they both pretended not to notice the whining growinglouder and louder as the sky became steadily darker stars wereblossoming in the blackness harry pulled his sweater back on trying to ignore the way the windshield wipers were now waving feebly as though in protestnot far said ron more to the car than to harry not farnow and he patted the dashboard nervouslywhen they flew back beneath the clouds a little while later theyhad to squint through the darkness for a landmark they knewthere harry shouted making ron and hedwig jumpstraight aheadsilhouetted on the dark horizon high on the cliff over the lakestood the many turrets and towers of hogwarts castlebut the car had begun to shudder and was losing speedcome on ron said cajolingly giving the steering wheel a little shake nearly there come on the engine groaned narrow jets of steam were issuing from under the hood harry found himself gripping the edges of his seatvery hard as they flew toward the lakethe car gave a nasty wobble glancing out of his window harrysaw the smooth black glassy surface of the water a mile belowrons knuckles were white on the steering wheel the car wobbledagaincome on ron mutteredthey were over the lake the castle was right ahead ronput his foot downthere was a loud clunk a splutter and the engine died completelyuhoh said ron into the silencethe nose of the car dropped they were falling gathering speedheading straight for the solid castle wallnoooooo ron yelled swinging the steering wheel around theymissed the dark stone wall by inches as the car turned in a great arcsoaring over the dark greenhouses then the vegetable patch and thenout over the black lawns losing altitude all the timeron let go of the steering wheel completely and pulled his wand out ofhis back pocketstop stop he yelled whacking the dashboard and thewindshield but they were still plummeting the ground flying up towardthemwatch out for that tree harry bellowed lunging for thesteering wheel but too latecrunchwith an earsplitting bang of metal on wood they hit the thick treetrunk and dropped to the ground with a heavy jolt steam wasbillowing from under the crumpled hood hedwig was shrieking interror a golfballsize lump was throbbing on harrys head where hehad hit the windshield and to his right ron let out a low despairinggroanare you okay harry said urgentlymy wand said ron in a shaky voice look at my wand it had snapped almost in two the tip was dangling limply held on by afew splintersharry opened his mouth to say he was sure theyd be able to mend itup at the school but he never even got started at that very momentsomething hit his side of the car with the force of ay charging bull sending him lurching sideways into ron just as anequally heavy blow hit the roofwhats happen ron gasped staring through the windshield and harry looked aroundjust in time to see a branch as thick as a python smash into it the treethey had hit was attacking them its trunk was bent almost double andits gnarled boughs were pummeling every inch of the car it couldreachaaargh said ron as another twisted limb punched a large dent intohis door the windshield was now trembling under a hail of blows fromknucklelike twigs and a branch as thick as a battering ram waspounding furiously on the roof which seemed to be cavingrun for it ron shouted throwing his full weight against his door butnext second he had been knocked backward into harrys lap by avicious uppercut from another branchwere done for he moaned as the ceiling sagged but suddenly thefloor of the car was vibrating the engine had restartedreverse harry yelled and the car shot backward the tree was stilltrying to hit them they could hear its roots creaking as it almost rippeditself up lashing out at them as they sped out of reachthat panted ron was close well done car the car however had reached the end of its tether with two sharpclunks the doors flew open and harry felt his seat tip sideways nextthing he knew he was sprawled on the damp ground loud thuds toldhim that the car was ejecting their luggage from the trunk hedwigscage flew through the air and burst open she rose out of it with anangry screech and sped off toward the castleywithout a backward look then dented scratched and steamingthe car rumbled off into the darkness its rear lights blazing angrilycome back ron yelled after it brandishing his broken wanddadll kill mebut the car disappeared from view with one last snort from itsexhaustcan you believe our luck said ron miserably bending down topick up scabbers of all the trees we couldve hit we had to getone that hits backhe glanced over his shoulder at the ancient tree which was stillflailing its branches threateninglycome on said harry wearily wed better get up to the schoolit wasnt at all the triumphant arrival they had pictured stiff coldand bruised they seized the ends of their trunks and began draggingthem up the grassy slope toward the great oak front doorsi think the feasts already started said ron dropping his trunk atthe foot of the front steps and crossing quietly to look through abrightly lit window hey harry come and look its the sortingharry hurried over and together he and ron peered in at the greathallinnumerable candles were hovering in midair over four longcrowded tables making the golden plates and goblets sparkleoverhead the bewitched ceiling which always mirrored the skyoutside sparkled with starsthrough the forest of pointed black hogwarts hats harry saw a longline of scaredlooking first years fiiing into the hall ginnywas among them easily visible because of her vivid weasley hairmeanwhile professor mcgonagall a bespectacled witch with her hairin a tight bun was placing the famous hogwarts sorting hat on astool before the newcomersevery year this aged old hat patched frayed and dirty sorted newstudents into the four hogwarts houses gryffindor hufflepuffravenclaw and slytherin harry well remembered putting it onexactly one year ago and waiting petrified for its decision as itmuttered aloud in his ear for a few horrible seconds he had fearedthat the hat was going to put him in slytherin the house that hadturned out more dark witches and wizards than any other but he hadended up in gryffindor along with ron hermione and the rest of theweasleys last term harry and ron had helped gryffindor win thehouse championship beating slytherin for the first time in sevenyearsa very small mousyhaired boy had been called forward to place thehat on his head harrys eyes wandered past him to where professordumbledore the headmaster sat watching the sorting from the stafftable his long silver beard and halfmoon glasses shining brightly in thecandlelight several seats along harry saw gilderoy lockhartdressed in robes of aquamarine and there at the end was hagridhuge and hairy drinking deeply from his goblethang on harry muttered to ron theres an empty chair at thestaff table wheres snapeprofessor severus snape was harrys least favorite teacher harryalso happened to be snapes least favorite student cruel sarcasticand disliked by everybody except the students from his own houseslytherin snape taught potionsmaybe hes ill said ron hopefullymaybe hes left said harry because he missed out on the defenseagainst dark arts job againor he might have been sacked said ron enthusiastically i meaneveryone hates him or maybe said a very cold voice right behind them hes waiting tohear why you two didnt arrive on the school trainharry spun around there his black robes rippling in a cold breezestood severus snape he was a thin man with sallow skin a hookednose and greasy shoulderlength black hair and at this moment hewas smiling in a way that told harry he and ron were in very deeptroublefollow me said snapenot daring even to look at each other harry and ron followed snapeup the steps into the vast echoing entrance hall which was lit withflaming torches a delicious smell of food was wafting from the greathall but snape led them away from the warmth and light down anarrow stone staircase that led into the dungeonsin he said opening a door halfway down the cold passageway andpointingthey entered snapes office shivering the shadowy walls were linedwith shelves of large glass ars in which floated all manner ofrevolting things harry didnt really want to know the name of at themoment the fireplace was dark and empty snape closed the doorand turned to look at themso he said softly the train isnt good enough for the famous harrypotter and his faithful sidekick weasley wanted to arrive with a bangdid we boysno sir it was the barrier at kings cross it silence said snape coldly what have you done with thecarron gulped this wasnt the first time snape had given harry theimpression of being able to read minds but a moment later he understood as snape unrolled todays issue of the evening prophetyou were seen he hissed showing them the headline flying ford anglia mystifies muggles he began to readaloud two muggles in london convinced they saw an old carflying over the post

muggle artifacts officehe said looking up at ron and smiling still more nastily deardear his own son harry felt as though hed just been walloped in the stomach byone of the mad trees larger branches if anyone found out mrweasley had bewitched the car he hadnt thought of that i noticed in my search of the park that considerable damageseems to have been done to a very valuable whomping willowsnape went onthat tree did more damage to us than we ron blurted outsilence snapped snape again most unfortunately you arenot in my house and the decision to expel you does not rest withme i shall go and fetch the people who do have that happy poweryou will wait hereharry and ron stared at each other whitefaced harry didntfeel hungry any more he now felt extremely sick he tried not tolook at a large slimy something suspended in green liquid on ashelf behind snapes desk if snape had gone to fetch professormcgonagall head of gryffindor house they were hardly any betteroff she might be fairer than snape but she was still extremely strictten minutes later snape returned and sure enough it was professormcgonagall who accompanied him harry had seen professormcgonagall angry on several occasions but either he had forgottenjust how thin her mouth could go or he had never seen her this angrybefore she raised her wand the moment she entered harry and ronboth flinched but she merely pointed it at the empty fireplace whereflames suddenly eruptedsit she said and they both backed into chairs by the fireexplain she said her glasses glinting ominouslyron launched into the story starting with the barrier at the stationrefusing to let them throughso we had no choice professor we couldnt get on the trainwhy didnt you send us a letter by owl i believe you have an owlprofessor mcgonagall said coldly to harryharry gaped at her now she said it that seemed the obvious thing tohave donei i didnt think that said professor mcgonagall is obviousthere was a knock on the office door and snape now looking happierthan ever opened it there stood the headmaster professordumbledoreharrys whole body went numb dumbledore was looking unusuallygrave he stared down his very crooked nose at them andharry suddenly found himself wishing he and ron were still beingbeaten up by the whomping willowthere was a long silence then dumbledore said please explain whyyou did thisit would have been better if he had shouted harry hated thedisappointment in his voice for some reason he was unable to lookdumbledore in the eyes and spoke instead to his knees he tolddumbledore everything except that mr weasley owned thebewitched car making it sound as though he and ron had happened tofind a flying car parked outside the station he knew dumbledorewould see through this at once but dumbledore asked no questionsabout the car when harry had finished he merely continued to peerat them through his spectacleswell go and get our stuff said ron in a hopeless sort of voicewhat are you talking about weasley barked professormcgonagallwell youre expelling us arent you said ronharry looked quickly at dumbledorenot today mr weasley said dumbledore but i must impress uponboth of you the seriousness of what you have done i will be writing toboth your families tonight i must also warn you that if you do anythinglike this again i will have no choice but to expel yousnape looked as though christmas had been canceled he cleared histhroat and said professor dumbledore these boys have flouted thedecree for the restriction of underage wizardry caused seriousdamage to an old and valuable tree surely acts of this nature iit will be for professor mcgonagall to decide on these boyspunishments severus said dumbledore calmly they are in herhouse and are therefore her responsibility he turned to professormcgonagall i must go back to the feast minerva ive got to giveout a few notices come severus theres a deliciouslooking custard tart i want to sample snape shot a look of pure venom at harry and ron as he allowedhimself to be swept out of his office leaving them alone with professor mcgonagall who was still eyeing them like a wrathful eagleyoud better get along to the hospital wing weasley yourebleedingnot much said ron hastily wiping the cut over his eye withhis sleeve professor i wanted to watch my sister being sorted the sorting ceremony is over said professor mcgonagallyour sister is also in gryffindoroh good said ronand speaking of gryffindor professor mcgonagall saidsharply but harry cut in professor when we took the car termhadnt started so so gryffindor shouldnt really have pointstaken from it should it he finished watching her anxiouslyprofessor mcgonagall gave him a piercing look but he was sureshe had almost smiled her mouth looked less thin anywayi will not take any points from gryffindor she said andharrys heart lightened considerably but you will both get a detentionit was better than harry had expected as for dumbledoreswriting to the dursleys that was nothing harry knew perfectlywell theyd just be disappointed that the whomping willow hadntsquashed him flatprofessor mcgonagall raised her wand again and pointed it at snapesdesk a large plate of sandwiches two silver goblets and a jug oficedpumpkin juice appeared with a popyou will eat in here and then go straight up to your dormitory shesaid i must also return to the feastwhen the door had closed behind her ron let out a long low whistlei thought wed had it he said grabbing a sandwichso did i said harry taking one toocan you believe our luck though said ron thickly through amouthful of chicken and ham fred and george mustve flown thatcar five or six times and no muggle ever saw them he swallowedand took another huge bite why couldnt we get through the barrierharry shrugged well have to watch our step from now on thoughhe said taking a grateful swig of pumpkin juice wish we couldvegone up to the feast she didnt want us showing off said ron sagely doesnt wantpeople to think its clever arriving by flying carwhen they had eaten as many sandwiches as they could the platekept refilling itself they rose and left the office treading the familiarpath to gryffindor tower the castle was quiet it seemed that thefeast was over they walked past muttering portraits and creakingsuits of armor and climbed narrow flights of stone stairs until at lastthey reached the passage where the secret entrance to gryffindortower was hidden behind an oil painting of a very fat woman in apink silk dresspassword she said as they approacheder said harrythey didnt know the new years password not having met agryffindor prefect yet but help came almost immediately they heardhurrying feet behind them and turned to see hermione dashing towardthemthere you are where have you been the most ridiculous rumors someone said youd been expelled for crashing a flying carwell we havent been expelled harry assured heryoure not telling me you did fly here said hermione soundingalmost as severe as professor mcgonagallskip the lecture said ron impatiently and tell us the newpasswordits wattlebird said hermione impatiently but thats not the point her words were cut short however as the portrait of the fat ladyswung open and there was a sudden storm of clapping it looked asthough the whole of gryffindor house was still awake packed intothe circular common room standing on the lopsided tables andsquashy armchairs waiting for them to arrive arms reached throughthe portrait hole to pull harry and ron inside leaving hermione toscramble in after thentbrilliant yelled lee jordan inspired what an entrance flying acar right into the whomping willow peoplell be talking about thatone for years good for you said a fifth year harry had never spoken to someonewas patting him on the back as though hed just won a marathonfred and george pushed their way to the front of the crowd and saidtogether why couldnt weve come in the car ehron was scarlet in the face grinning embarrassedly but harry couldsee one person who didnt look happy at all percy was visible overthe heads of some excited first years and he seemed to be trying toget near enough to start telling them off harry nudged ron in theribs and nodded in percys direction ron got the point at oncegot to get upstairs bit tired he said and the two of them startedpushing their way toward the door on the other side of the roomwhich led to a spiral staircase and the dormitoriesnight harry called back to hermione who was wearing a scowljust like percysthey managed to get to the other side of the common room stillhaving their backs slapped and gained the peace of the staircasethey hurried up it right to the top and at last reached the door oftheir old dormitory which now had a sign on it saying second yearsthey entered the familiar circular room with its five fourpostershung with red velvet and its high narrow windows their trunks hadbeen brought up for them and stood at the ends of their bedsron grinned guiltily at harryi know i shouldntve enjoyed that or anything but the dormitory door flew open and in came the other second yeargryffindor boys seamus finnigan dean thomas and

a slight stiffness in theway she said morning which told harry that she was stilldisapproving of the way they had arrived neville longbottom on theother hand greeted them cheerfully neville was a roundfaced andaccidentprone boy with the worst memory of anyone harry had evermetmails due any minute i think grans sending a few things i forgotharry had only just started his porridge when sure

stretched out a shaking hand eased the envelope from errolsbeak and slit it open neville stuffed his fingers in his ears a splitsecond later harry knew why he thought for a moment it hadexploded a

over them a fewpeople laughed and gradually a babble of talk broke out againhermione closed voyages with vampires and looked down at the topof rons headwell i dont know what you expected ron but you dont tell me i deserved it snapped ronharry pushed his porridge away his insides were burning with guiltmr weasley was facing an inquiry at work after all mr and mrsweasley had done for him over the

seemed to think they had now been punished enough andwas being perfectly friendly againas they neared the greenhouses they saw the rest of the classstanding outside waiting for professor sprout harry ron andhermione had only just joined them when she came striding into viewacross the lawn accompanied by gilderoy lockhart professorsprouts arms were full of bandages and with another twinge of guiltharry spotted the whomping willow in the distance several of itsbranches now in slingsprofessor sprout was a squat little witch who wore a patched hat overher flyaway hair there was usually a large amount of earth on herclothes and her fingernails would have made aunt petunia faintgilderoy lockhart however was immaculate in sweeping robes ofturquoise his golden hair shining under a perfectly positioned turquoisehat with gold trimmingoh hello there he called beaming around at the assembledstudents just been showing professor sprout the right way to doctora whomping willow but i

who waslooking distinctly disgruntled not at all her usual cheerful selfthere was a murmur of interest they had only ever worked ingreenhouse one before greenhouse three housed far more interestingand dangerous plants professor sprout took a large key from her beltand unlocked the door harry caught a whiff of damp earth andfertilizer mingling with the heavy perfume of some giant umbrellasizedflowers dangling from the ceiling he was about to follow ronand hermione inside when lockharts hand shot outharry ive been wanting a word you dont mind if hes a couple ofminutes late do you professor sproutjudging by professor sprouts scowl she did mind but lockhart saidthats the ticket and closed the greenhouse door in her faceharry said lockhart his large white teeth gleaming in

few seconds then remembering he was supposed tobe in the greenhouse he opened the door and slid insideprofessor sprout was standing behind a trestle bench in the center of the greenhouse about twenty pairs of differentcolored earmuffs were lying on the bench when harry had taken his placebetween ron and hermione she said well be repotting mandrakes today now who can tell me the properties of the mandraketo nobodys surprise hermiones hand was first into the airsmandrake or mandragora is a powerful restorative said hermionesounding as usual as though she had swallowed the textbook it isused to

alsohowever dangerous who can tell me whyhermiones hand narrowly missed harrys glasses as it shot up againthe cry of the mandrake is fatal to anyone who hears it she saidpromptlyprecisely take another ten points said professor sprout now themandrakes we have here are still very youngshe pointed to a row of deep trays as she spoke and everyoneshuffled forward for a better look a hundred or so tufty little plantspurplish green in color were growing there in rows they looked quiteunremarkable to harry who didnt have the slightest idea whathermione meant by the cry of the mandrakeeveryone take a pair of earmuffs said professor sproutthere was a scramble as everyone tried to seize a pair that wasntpink and fluffywhen i tell you to put them on make sure your ears are completelycovered said professor sprout when it is safe to remove them iwill give you the thumbsup right earmuffs onharry snapped the earmuffs over his ears they shut out soundcompletely professor sprout put the pink fluffy pair over her ownears rolled up the sleeves of her robes grasped one of the tufty plantsfirmly and pulled hardharry let out a gasp of surprise that no one could hearinstead of roots a small muddy and extremely ugly baby popped outof the earth the leaves were growing right out of his head he hadpale green mottled skin and was clearly bawling at the top of hislungsprofessor sprout took a large plant pot from under the table andplunged the mandrake into it burying him in dark damp compost untilonly the tufted leaves were visible professor sprout dusted off herhands gave them all the thumbsup and removed her own earmuffsas our mandrakes are only seedlings their cries wont kill yet shesaid calmly as though shed just done nothing more exciting than watera begonia however they will knock you out

a tray there is a large supply of pots here compost in thesacks over there and be careful of the venemous tentacula itsteethingshe gave a sharp slap to a spiky dark red plant as she spoke makingit draw in the long feelers that had been inching sneakily over hershoulderharry ron and hermione were joined at their tray by a curlyhairedhufflepuff boy harry knew by sight but had never spoken tojustin finchfletchley he said brightly shaking harry by the handknow who you are of course the famous harry potter and yourehermione granger always top in everythinghermione beamed as she had her hand shaken too and ronweasley wasnt that your flying carron didnt smile the howler was obviously still on his mindthat lockharts something isnt he said justin happily as theybegan fiiling their plant

down for eton you know i cant tell you how glad iam i came here instead of course mother was slightly disappointedbut since i made her read lockharts books i think shes begun to seehow useful itll be to have a fully trained wizard in the family after that they didnt have much chance to talk their earmuffs wereback on and they needed to concentrate on the mandrakes professorsprout had made it look extremely easy but it wasnt the mandrakesdidnt like coming out of the earth but didnt seem to want to go backinto it either they squirmed kicked flailed their sharp little fists andgnashed their teeth harry spent ten whole minutes trying to squash aparticularly fat one into a potby the end of the class harry like everyone else was sweatyaching and covered in earth everyone traipsed back to the castle fora quick wash and then the gryffindors hurried off to transfigurationprofessor mcgonagalls classes were always hard work but todaywas especially difficult everything harry had learned last yearseemed to have leaked out of his head during the summer he wassupposed to be turning a beetle into a button but all he managedto do was give his beetle a lot of exercise as it scuttled over thedesktop avoiding his wandron was having far worse problems he had patched up his wandwith some borrowed spellotape but it seemed to be damaged beyondrepair it kept crackling and sparking at odd moments and every timeron tried to transfigure his beetle it engulfed him in thick gray smokethat smelled of rotten eggs unable to see what he was doing ronaccidentally squashed his beetle with his elbow and had to ask for anew one professor mcgonagall wasnt pleasedharry was relieved to hear the lunch bell his brain felt like a wrungsponge everyone fiied out of the classroom except him and ron whowas whacking his wand furiously on the deskstupid useless thing write home for another one harry suggested as the wand let off avolley of bangs like a firecrackeroh yeah and get another howler back said ron stuffing the nowhissing wand into his bag its your own fault your wand got snapped they went down to lunch where rons mood was not improved byhermiones showing them the handful of perfect coat buttons she hadproduced in transfigurationwhatve we got this afternoon said harry hastily changing thesubjectdefense against the dark arts said hermione at oncewhy demanded ron seizing her schedule have you outlined alllockharts lessons in little heartshermione snatched the schedule back blushing furiouslythey finished lunch and went outside into the overcast courtyardhermione sat down on a stone step and buried her nose in voyageswith vampires again harry and ron stood talking about quidditch forseveral minutes before harry became aware that he was being closelywatched looking up he saw the very small mousyhaired boy hedseen trying on the sorting hat last night staring at harry as thoughtransfixed he was clutching what looked like an ordinary mugglecamera and the moment harry looked at him he went bright redall right harry im im colin creevey he said breathlessly takinga tentative step forward im in gryffindor too dyou think would itbe all right if can i have a picture he

all this whats all this gilderoy lockhart was stridingtoward them his turquoise robes swirling behind him whos giving out signed photosharry started to speak but he was cut short as lockhart flung anarm around his shoulders and thundered jovially shouldnt haveasked we meet again harrypinned to lockharts side and burning with humiliation harrysaw malfoy slide smirking back into the crowdcome on then mr creevey said lockhart beaming at colina double portrait cant do better than that and well both sign itfor youcolin fumbled for his camera and took the picture as the bellrang behind them

schoolmates wont think youre setting yourself up somuch deaf to harrys stammers lockhart swept him down a corridorlined with staring students and up a staircaselet me just say that handing out signed

chortle i dont think youre quite there yetthey had reached lockharts classroom and he let harry go atlast harry yanked his robes straight and headed for a seat at the veryback of the class where he busied himself with piling all seven oflockharts books in front of him so that he could avoid looking at thereal thingthe rest of the class came clattering in and ron and hermione satdown on either side of harryyou couldve fried an egg on your face said ron youd better hopecreevey doesnt meet ginny or theyll be starting a harry potter fanclubshut up snapped harry the last thing he needed was for lockhartto hear the phrase harry potter fan clubwhen the whole class was seated lockhart cleared his throat loudlyand silence fell he reached forward picked up neville longbottomscopy of travels with

dean thomas who were sitting in front were shakingwith silent laughter hermione on the other hand was listening tolockhart with rapt attention and gave a start when he mentioned hernamebut miss hermione granger knew my secret ambition is to rid theworld of evil and market my own range of haircare potions goodgirl in fact he flipped her paper over full marks where is misshermione grangerhermione raised a trembling handexcellent beamed lockhart quite excellent take ten points forgryffindor and so to business he bent down behind his desk and lifted a large covered cage onto itnow be warned it is my job to arm you against the foulestcreatures known to wizardkind you may find yourselves facing yourworst fears in this room know only that no harm can befall you whilsti am here all i ask is that you remain calmin spite of himself harry leaned around his pile of books for a betterlook at the cage lockhart placed a hand on the cover dean andseamus had stopped laughing now neville was cowering in his frontrow seati must ask you not to scream said lockhart in a low voice it mightprovoke themas the whole class held its breath lockhart whipped off the coveryes he said dramatically freshly caught cornish pixies seamus finnigan couldnt control himself he let out a snort oflaughter that even lockhart couldnt mistake for a scream of terroryes he smiled at seamuswell theyre not theyre not very dangerous are they seamuschokeddont be so sure said lockhart waggling a finger annoyingly atseamus devilish tricky little blighters they can bethe pixies were electric blue and about eight inches high with pointedfaces and voices so shrill it was like listening to a lot of budgiesarguing the moment the cover had been removed theyhad started jabbering and rocketing around rattling the bars andmaking bizarre faces at the people nearest themright then lockhart said loudly lets see what you make ofthem and he opened the cageit was pandemonium the pixies shot in every direction like rocketstwo of them seized neville by the ears and lifted him into the airseveral shot straight through the window showering the back rowwith broken glass the rest proceeded to wreck the classroom moreeffectively than a rampaging rhino they grabbed ink bottles andsprayed the class with them shredded books and papers tore picturesfrom the walls upended the waste basket grabbed bags and booksand threw them out of the smashed window within minutes half theclass was sheltering under desks and neville was swinging from theiron chandelier in the ceilingcome on now round them up round them up theyre only pixieslockhart shoutedhe rolled up his sleeves brandished his wand and bellowedpeskipiksi pesternomiit had absolutely no effect one of the pixies seized his wand andthrew it out of the window too lockhart gulped and dived under hisown desk narrowly avoiding being squashed by neville who fell asecond later as the chandelier gave waythe bell rang and there was a mad rush toward the exit in the relativecalm that followed lockhart straightened up caught sight of harryron and hermione who were almost at the door and said well illask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage heswept past them and shut the door quickly behind himcan you believe him roared ron as one of the remaining pixies bithim painfully on the earhe just wants to give us some handson experience said hermioneimmobilizing two pixies at once with a clever freezing charm andstuffing them back into their cagehands on said harry who was trying to grab a pixie dancing out ofreach with its tongue out hermione he didnt have a clue what hewas doing rubbish said hermione youve read his books look at all thoseamazing things hes done he says hes done ron mutteredarry spent a lot of time over the next few days dodging out of sightwhenever he saw gilderoy lockhart coming down a corridor harderto avoid was colin creevey who seemed to have memorized harrysschedule nothing seemed to give colin a bigger thrill than to say allright harry six or seven times a day and hear hello colin backhowever exasperated harry sounded when he said ithedwig was still angry with harry about the disasterous car journeyand rons wand was still malfunctioning surpassing itself on fridaymorning by shooting out of rons hand in charms and hitting tiny oldprofessor flitwick squarely between the eyes creating a largethrobbing green boil where it had struck so with one thing andanother harry was quite glad to reach the weekend he ron andhermione were planning to visit hagrid on saturday morning harryhowever was shaken awake several hours earlierthan he would have liked by oliver wood captain of the gryffindorquidditch teamwhassamatter said harry groggilyquidditch practice said wood come onharry squinted at the window there was a thin mist hanging acrossthe pinkandgold sky now that he was awake he couldntunderstand how he could have slept through the racket the birds weremakingoliver harry croaked its the crack of dawnexactly said wood he was a tall and burly sixth year and at themoment his eyes were gleaming with a crazed enthusiasm its partof our new training program come on grab your broom and lets gosaid wood heartily none of the other teams have started training yetwere going to be first off the mark this year yawning and shivering slightly harry climbed out of bed and tried tofind his quidditch robesgood man said wood meet you on the field in fifteen minuteswhen hed found his scarlet team robes and pulled on his cloak forwarmth harry scribbled a note to ron explaining where hed gone andwent down the spiral staircase to the common room his nimbus twothousand on his shoulder he had just reached the portrait hole whenthere was a clatter behind him and colin creevey came dashing downthe spiral staircase his camera swinging madly around his neck andsomething clutched in his handi heard someone saying your name on the stairs harry look whative got here ive had it developed i wanted to show you harry looked bemusedly at the photograph colin was brandishingunder his nosea moving blackandwhite lockhart was tugging hard on an armharry recognized as his own he was pleased to see that hisphotographic self was putting up a good fight and refusing to bedragged into view as harry watched lockhart gave up andslumped panting against the white edge of the picturewill you sign it said colin eagerlyno said harry flatly glancing around to check that the room wasreally deserted sorry colin im in a hurry quidditch practice he climbed through the portrait holeoh wow wait for me ive never watched a quidditch gamebeforecolin scrambled through the hole after himitll be really boring harry said quickly but colin ignored him hisface shining with excitementyou were the youngest house player in a hundred years werentyou harry werent you said colin trotting alongside him youmust be brilliant ive never flown is it easy is that your ownbroom is that the best one there isharry didnt know how to get rid of him it was like having anextremely talkative shadowi dont really understand quidditch said colin breathlessly is ittrue there are four balls and two of them fly around trying to knockpeople off their broomsyes said harry heavily resigned to explaining the complicatedrules of quidditch theyre called bludgers there are two beaterson each team who carry clubs to beat the bludgers away from theirside fred and george weasley are the gryffindor beatersand what are the other balls for colin asked tripping down acouple of steps because he was gazing openmouthed at harrywell the quafe thats the biggish red one is the one that scoresgoals three chasers on each team throw the quaffle to each otherand try and get it through the goal posts at the end of the pitch theyre three long poles with hoops on the endand the fourth ball is the golden snitch said harry and its very small very fast anddifficult to catch but thats what the seekers got to do because agame of quidditch doesnt end until the snitch has been caught andwhichever teams seeker gets the snitch earns his team an extrahundred and fifty pointsand youre the gryffindor seeker arent you said colin in aweyes said harry as they left the castle and started across the dewdrenchedgrass and theres the keeper too he guards the goalposts thats it reallybut colin didnt stop questioning harry all the way down the slopinglawns to the quidditch field and harry only shook him off when hereached the changing rooms colin called after him in a piping voiceill go and get a good seat harry and hurried off to the standsthe rest of the gryffindor team were already in the changing roomwood was the only person who looked truly awake fred and georgeweasley were sitting puffyeyed and touslehaired next to fourth yearalicia spinnet who seemed to be nodding off against the wall behindher her fellow chasers katiebell and angelina johnson were yawning side by side oppositethemthere you are harry what kept you said wood briskly now iwanted a quick talk with you all before we actually get onto the fieldbecause i spent the summer devising a whole new training programwhich i really think will make all the difference wood was holding up a large diagram of a quidditch field on whichwere drawn many lines arrows and crosses in differentcolored inkshe took out his wand tapped the board and the arrows began towiggle over the diagram like caterpillars as wood launched into aspeech about his new tactics fred weasleys head drooped rightonto alicia spinnets shoulder and he began to snorethe first board took nearly twenty minutes to explain but there wasanother board under that and a third under that one harry sank intoa stupor as wood droned on and onso said wood at long last jerking harry from a wistful fantasyabout what he could be eating for breakfast at this very moment upat the castle is that clear any questionsive got a question oliver said george who had woken with astart why couldnt you have told us all this yesterday when wewere awakewood wasnt pleasednow listen here you lot he said glowering at them all weshould have won the quidditch cup last year were easily the bestteam but unfortunately owing to circumstances beyond our control harry shifted guiltily in his seat he had been unconscious in thehospital wing for the final match of the previous year meaning thatgryffindor had been a player short and had suffered their worstdefeat in three hundred yearswood took a moment to regain control of himself their last defeatwas clearly still torturing himso this year we train harder than ever before okay lets go andput our new theories into practice wood shouted seizing hisbroomstick and leading the way out of the locker rooms stiffleggedand still yawning his team followedthey had been in the locker room so long that the sun was upcompletely now although remnants of mist hung over the grass in thestadium as harry walked onto the field he saw ron and hermionesitting in the standsarent you finished yet called ron incredulouslyhavent even started said harry looking jealously at the toast andmarmalade ron and hermione had brought out of the great hallwoods been teaching us new moveshe mounted his broomstick and kicked at the ground soaring up intothe air the cool morning air whipped his face waking him far moreeffectively than woods long talk it felt wonderful to be back on thequidditch field he soared right around the stadium at full speedracing fred and georgewhats that funny clicking noise called fred as they hurtled aroundthe cornerharry looked into the stands colin was sitting in one of the highestseats his camera raised taking picture after picture the soundstrangely magnified in the deserted stadiumiolook this way harry this way he cried shrillywhos that said fredno idea harry lied putting on a spurt of speed that took him as faraway as possible from colinwhats going on said wood frowning as he skimmed through theair toward them whys that first year taking pictures i dont like ithe could be a slytherin spy trying to find out about our new trainingprogramhes in gryffindor said harry quicklyand the slytherins dont need a spy oliver said georgewhat makes you say that said wood testilybecause theyre here in person said george pointingseveral people in green robes were walking onto the field broomsticksin their handsi dont believe it wood hissed in outrage i booked the field fortoday well see about thiswood shot toward the ground landing rather harder than he meant toin his anger staggering slightly as he dismounted harry fred andgeorge followedflint wood bellowed at the slytherin captain this is our practicetime we got up specially you can clear off nowmarcus flint was

robespulled out his wand yelling youll pay for that one malfoy andpointed it furiously under flints arm at malfoys facea loud bang echoed around the stadium and a jet of green light shotout of the

over themany moving faces of lockhart watching him harry moved hisaching hand over what felt like the thousandth envelope writing outveronica smethleys address it must be nearly time to leave

turned into muddy streams and hagridspumpkins swelled to the size of garden sheds oliver woods enthusiasm forregular training sessions however was not dampened which was why harrywas to be found late

sessionfred and george who had been spying on the slytherin team had seen forthemselves the speed of those new nimbus two thousand and ones theyreported that the slytherin team was no more than seven greenish blursshooting through the air like missilesas harry squelched along the deserted corridor he came across somebodywho looked just as preoccupied as he was nearly headless nick the ghostof gryffindor tower was staring morosely out of a window mutteringunder his breath dont fulfill their requirements half an inch if that hello nick said harryhello hello said nearly headless nick starting and looking round hewore a dashing plumed hat on his long curly hair and a tunic with a ruffwhich concealed the fact that his neck was almost completely severed hewas pale as smoke and harry could see right through him to the dark skyand torrential rain outsideyou look troubled young potter said nick folding a transparent letter ashe spoke and tucking it inside his doubletso do you said harryah nearly headless nick waved an elegant hand a matter of noimportance its not as though i really wanted to join thought idapply but apparently i dont fulfill requirements in spite of his airy tone there was a look of great bitterness on his facebut you would think wouldnt you he erupted suddenly pulling the letterback out of his pocket that getting hit fortyfive times in the neck with ablunt axe would qualify you to join the headless huntoh yes said harry who was obviously supposed to agreei mean nobody wishes more than i do that it had all been quick and cleanand my head had come off properly i mean it would have saved me a greatdeal of pain and ridicule however nearly headless nick shook his letteropen and read furiously we can only accept huntsmen whose heads haveparted company with their bodies you will appreciate that it would beimpossible otherwise for members to participate in hunt activities such ashorseback headjuggling and head polo it is with the greatest regrettherefore that i must inform you that you do not fulfill our requirementswith very best wishes sir patrick delaneypodmorefuming nearly headless nick stuffed the letter awayhalf an inch of skin and sinew holding my neck on harry most peoplewould think thats good and beheaded but oh no its not enough for sirproperly decapitatedpodmorenearly headless nick took several deep breaths and then said in a farcalmer tone so whats bothering you anything i can dono said harry not unless you know where we can get seven freenimbus two thousand and ones for our match against sly the rest of harrys sentence was drowned out by a highpitched mewlingfrom somewhere near his ankles he looked down and found himself gazinginto a pair of lamplike yellow eyes it was mrs norris the skeletal gray catwho was used by the caretaker argus filch as a sort of deputy in hisendless battle against studentsyoud better get out of here harry said nick quickly filch isnt in agood mood hes got the flu and some third years accidentally plastered frogbrains all over the ceiling in dungeon five hes been cleaning all morningand if he sees you dripping mud all over the place right said harry backing away from the accusing stare of mrs norrisbut not quickly enough drawn to the spot by the mysterious power thatseemed to connect him with his foul cat argus filch burst suddenly througha tapestry to harrys right wheezing and looking wildly about for the rulebreakerthere was a thick tartan scarf bound around his head and his nosewas unusually purplefilth he shouted his jowls aquiver his eyes popping alarmingly as hepointed at the muddy puddle that had dripped from harrys quidditch robesmess and muck everywhere ive had enough of it i tell you follow mepotterso harry waved a gloomy goodbye to nearly headless nick and followedfilch back downstairs doubling the number of muddy footprints on thefloorharry had never been inside filchs office before it was a place moststudents avoided the room was dingy and windowless lit by a single oillamp dangling from the low ceiling a faint smell of fried fish lingered aboutthe place wooden filing cabinets stood around the walls from their labelsharry could see that they contained details of every pupil filch had everpunished fred and george weasley had an entire drawer to themselves ahighly polished collection of chains and manacles hung on the wall behindfilchs desk it was common knowledge that he was always beggingdumbledore to let him suspend students by their ankles from the ceilingfilch grabbed a quill from a pot on his desk and began shuffling aroundlooking for parchmentdung he muttered furiously great sizzling dragon bogies frog brainsrat intestines ive had enough of it make an example wheresthe form yes he retrieved a large roll of parchment from his desk drawer and stretched itout in front of him dipping his long black quill into the ink potname harry potter crime it was only a bit of mud said harryits only a bit of mud to you boy but to me its an extra hour scrubbingshouted filch a drip shivering unpleasantly at the end of his bulbous nosecrime befouling the castle suggested sentence dabbing at his streaming nose filch squinted unpleasantly at harry whowaited with bated breath for his sentence to fallbut as filch lowered his quill there was a great bang on the ceiling ofthe office which made the oil lamp rattlepeeves filch roared flinging down his quill in a transport of rage illhave you this time ill have youand without a backward glance at harry filch ran flatfooted from theoffice mrs norris streaking alongside himpeeves was the school poltergeist a grinning airborne menace who lived tocause havoc and distress harry didnt much like peeves but couldnt helpfeeling grateful for his timing hopefully whatever peeves had done and itsounded as though hed wrecked something very big this time woulddistract filch from harrythinking that he should probably wait for filch to come back harry sankinto a motheaten chair next to the desk there was only one thing on it apartfrom his halfcompleted form a large glossy purple envelope with silverlettering on the front with a quick glance at the door to check that filchwasnt on his way back harry picked up the envelope and read kwikspell acorrespondence course in beginners magicintrigued harry flicked the envelope open and pulled out the sheaf ofparchment inside more curly silver writing on the front page said feel outof step in the world of modern magic find yourself making excuses not toperform simple spells ever been taunted for

thumbed through the rest of the envelopes contents whyon earth did filch want a kwikspell course did this mean he wasnt aproper wizard harry was just reading lesson one holding your wandsome useful tips when shuffling footsteps outside told him filch wascoming back stuffing the parchment back into the envelope harry threw itback onto the desk just as the door openedfilch was looking triumphantthat vanishing cabinet was extremely valuable he was saying gleefully tomrs norris well have peeves out this time my sweet his eyes fell on harry and then darted to the kwikspell envelope whichharry realized too late was lying two feet away from where it had startedfilchs pasty face went brick red harry braced himself for a tidal wave offury filch hobbled across to his desk snatched up the envelope and threw itinto a drawerhave you did you read he sputteredno harry lied quicklyfilchs knobbly hands were twisting togetherif i thought youd read my private not that its mine for a friend be thatas it may however harry was staring at him alarmed filch had never looked madder his eyeswere popping a tic was going in one of his pouchy cheeks and the tartanscarf didnt helpvery well go and dont breathe a word not that however if you didntread go now i have to write up peeves report go amazed at his luck harry sped out of the office up the corridor and backupstairs to escape from filchs office without punishment was probablysome kind of school recordharry harry did it worknearly headless nick came gliding out of a classroom behind him harrycould see the wreckage of a large blackandgold cabinet that appeared tohave been dropped from a great heighti persuaded peeves to crash it right over filchs office said nick eagerlythought it might distract him was that you said harry gratefully yeah it worked i didnt even getdetention thanks nickthey set off up the corridor together nearly headless nick harry noticedwas still holding sir patricks rejection letteri wish there was something i could do for you about the headless huntharry saidnearly headless nick stopped in his tracks and harry walked right throughhim he wished he hadnt it was like stepping through an icy showerbut there is something you could do for me said nick excitedly harry would i be asking too much but no you wouldnt want what is it said harrywell this halloween will be my five hundredth deathday said nearlyheadless nick drawing himself up and looking dignifiedoh said harry not sure whether he should look sorry or happy about thisrightim holding a party down in one of the roomier

patrickhow very frightening and impressive you find meof of course said harrynearly headless nick beamed at him a deathday party said hermionekeenly when harry had changed at last and joined her and ron in thecommon room i bet there arent many living people who can say theyvebeen to one of those itll be fascinatingwhy would anyone want to celebrate the day they died said ron whowas halfway through his potions homework and grumpy sounds deaddepressing to me rain was still lashing the windows which were now inky black but insideall looked bright and cheerful the firelight glowed over the countlesssquashy armchairs where people sat reading talking doing homework or inthe case of fred and george weasley trying to find out what would happenif you fed a filibuster firework to a salamander fred had rescued thebrilliant orange firedwelling lizard from a care of magical creatures classand it was now smouldering gently on a table surrounded by a knot ofcurious peopleharry was at the point of telling ron and hermione about filch and thekwikspell course when the salamander suddenly whizzed into the airemitting loud sparks and bangs as it whirled wildly round the room thesight of percy bellowing himself hoarse at fred and george the spectaculardisplay of tangerine stars showering from the salamanders mouth and itsescape into the fire with accompanying explosions drove both filch and thekwikspell envelope from harrys mind by the time halloween arrivedharry was regretting his rash promise to go to the deathday party the rest ofthe school was happily anticipating their halloween feast the great hall hadbeen decorated with the usual live bats hagrids vast pumpkins had beencarved into lanterns large enough for three men to sit in and there wererumors that dumbledore had booked a troupe of dancing skeletons for theentertainmenta promise is a promise hermione reminded harry bossily you saidyoud go to the deathday partyso at seven oclock harry ron and hermione walked straight past thedoorway to the packed great hall which was glittering invitingly with goldplates and candles and directed their steps instead toward the dungeonsthe passageway leading to nearly headless nicks party had been linedwith candles too though the effect was far from cheerful these were longthin jetblack tapers all burning bright blue casting a dim ghostly lighteven over their own living faces the temperature dropped with every stepthey took as harry shivered and drew his robes tightly around him heheard what sounded like a thousand fingernails scraping an enormousblackboardis that supposed to be music ron whispered they turned a corner andsaw nearly headless nick standing at a doorway hung with black velvetdrapesmy dear friends he said mournfully welcome welcome so pleasedyou could come he swept off his plumed hat and bowed them insideit was an incredible sight the dungeon was full of hundreds of pearlywhitetranslucent people mostly drifting around a crowded dance floorwaltzing to the dreadful quavering sound of thirty musical saws played byan orchestra on a raised blackdraped platform a chandelier overheadblazed midnightblue with a thousand more black candles their breath rosein a mist before them it was like stepping into a freezershall we have a look around harry suggested wanting to warm up hisfeetcareful not to walk through anyone said ron nervously and they set offaround the edge of the dance floor they passed a group of gloomy nuns aragged man wearing chains and the fat friar a cheerful hufflepuff ghostwho was talking to a knight with an arrow sticking out of his forehead harrywasnt surprised to see that the bloody baron a gaunt staring slytheringhost covered in silver bloodstains was being given a wide berth by theother ghostsoh no said hermione stopping

quite disgusting large rotten fish were laidon handsome silver platters cakes burned charcoalblack were heaped onsalvers there was a great maggoty haggis a slab of cheese covered in furrygreen mold and in pride of place an enormous gray cake in the shape of atombstone with tarlike icing forming the words sir nicholas de mimsyporpingtondied st october harry watched amazed as a portly ghost approached the table crouchedlow and walked through it his mouth held wide so that it passed throughone of the stinking salmoncan you taste it if you walk though it harry asked himalmost said the ghost sadly and he drifted awayi expect theyve let it rot to give it a stronger flavor said hermioneknowledgeably pinching her nose and leaning closer to look at the putridhaggiscan we move i feel sick said ronthey had barely turned around however when a little man swoopedsuddenly from under the table and came to a halt in midair before themhello peeves said harry cautiouslyunlike the ghosts

aheadless horseman the assembly clapped wildly harry started to clap toobut stopped quickly at the sight of nicks facethe horses galloped into the middle of the dance floor and halted rearingand plunging at the front of the pack was a large ghost who held hisbearded head under his arm from which position he was blowing the hornthe ghost leapt down lifted his head high in the air so he could see over thecrowd everyone laughed and strode over to nearly headless nicksquashing his head back onto his necknick he roared how are you head still hanging in therehe gave a hearty guffaw and clapped nearly headless nick on the shoulderwelcome patrick said nick stifflylive uns said sir patrick spotting harry ron and hermione and givinga huge fake jump of astonishment so that his head fell off

as sir patricks head went sailing past him to loud cheersharry was very cold by now not to mention hungryi cant stand much more of this ron muttered his teeth chattering as theorchestra ground back into action and the ghosts swept back onto the dancefloorlets go harry agreedthey backed toward the door nodding and beaming at anyone who lookedat them and a minute later were hurrying back up the passageway full ofblack candlespudding might not be finished yet said ron hopefully leading the waytoward the steps to the entrance halland then harry heard itrip tear kill it was the same voice the same cold murderous voice he had heard inlockharts officehe stumbled to a halt clutching at the stone wall listening with all hismight looking around squinting up and down the dimly lit passagewayharry whatre you its that voice again shut up a minute soo hungry for so long listen said harry urgently and ron and hermione froze watching himkill time to kill the voice was growing fainter harry was sure it was moving away moving upward a mixture of fear and excitement gripped him as he staredat the dark ceiling how could it be moving upward was it a phantom towhom stone ceilings didnt matterthis way he shouted and he began to run up the stairs into the entrancehall it was no good hoping to hear anything here the babble of talk from thehalloween feast was echoing out of the great hall harry sprinted up themarble staircase to the first floor ron and hermione clattering behind himharry whatre we shhharry strained his ears distantly from the floor above and growing fainterstill he heard the voice i smell blood i smell bloodhis stomach lurched its going to kill someone he shouted and ignoring rons and hermionesbewildered faces he ran up the next flight of steps three at a time trying tolisten over his own pounding footsteps harry hurtled around the whole of the second floor ron and hermionepanting behind him not stopping until they turned a corner into the lastdeserted passageharry what was that all about said ron wiping sweat off his face icouldnt hear anything but hermione gave a sudden gasp pointing down the corridorlooksomething was shining on the wall ahead they approached slowlysquinting through the darkness foothigh words had been daubed on thewall between two windows shimmering in the light cast by the flamingtorches the chamber of secrets has been opened enemies of the heirbewarewhats that thing hanging underneath said ron a slight quiver in hisvoiceas they edged nearer harry almost slipped there was a large puddle ofwater on the floor ron and hermione grabbed him and they inched towardthe message eyes fixed on a dark shadow beneath it all three of themrealized what it was at once and leapt backward with a splashmrs norristhe caretakers cat was hanging by her tail from the torchbracket she was stiff as a board her eyes wide and staringfor a few seconds they didnt move then ron said lets get out of hereshouldnt we try and help harry began awkwardlytrust me said ron we dont want to be found herebut it was too late a rumble as though of distant thunder told them thatthe feast had just ended from either end of the corridor where they stoodcame the sound of hundreds of feet climbing the stairs and the loud happytalk of wellfed people next moment students were crashing into thepassage from both endsthe chatter the bustle the noise died suddenly as the people in front spottedthe hanging cat harry ron and hermione stood alone in the middle of thecorridor as silence fell among the mass of students pressing forward to seethe grisly sightthen someone shouted through the quietenemies of the heir beware youll be next mudbloodsit was draco malfoy he had pushed to the front of the crowd his cold eyesalive his usually bloodless face flushed as he grinned at the sight of thehanging immobile catc h a p t x ir n i n ethe wrtitingon the wallwhats going on here whats going on attracted no doubt bymalfoys shout argus filch came shouldering his way through thecrowd then he saw mrs norris and fell back clutching his face inhorrormy cat my cat whats happened to mrs norris he shriekedand his popping eyes fell on

just upstairs please feel free thank you gilderoy said dumbledorethe silent crowd parted to let them pass lockhart looking excited andimportant hurried after dumbledore so did professors mcgonagalland snapeas they entered lockharts darkened office there was a flurry ofmovement across the walls harry saw several of the lockharts in thepictures dodging out of sight their hair in rollers the real lockhart litthe candles on his desk and stood back dumbledore lay mrs norrison the polished surface and began to examine her harry ron andhermione exchanged tense looks and sank into chairs outside the poolof candlelight watchingthe tip of dumbledores long crooked nose was barely an inch frommrs norriss fur he was looking at her closely through his halfmoonspectacles his long fingers gently prodding and poking professormcgonagall was bent almost as close her eyes narrowed snapeloomed behind them half in shadow wearing a most peculiarexpression it was as though he was trying hard not to smile andlockhart was hovering around all of them making suggestionsit was definitely a curse that killed her probably the transmogrifiantorture ive seen it used many times so unlucky i wasnt there iknow the very countercurse that would have saved her lockharts comments were punctuated by filchs dry racking sobshe was slumped in a chair by the desk unable to look at mrs norrishis face in his hands much as he detested filch harrycouldnt help feeling a bit sorry for him though not nearly as sorry ashe felt for himself if dumbledore believed filch he would be expelledfor suredumbledore was now muttering strange words under his breath andtapping mrs norris with his wand but nothing happened shecontinued to look as though she had been recently stuffedi remember something very similar happening in ouagadogousaid lockhart a series of attacks the full storys in myautobiography i was able to provide the townsfolk with variousamulets which cleared the matter up at once the photographs of lockhart on the walls were all nodding inagreement as he talked one of them had forgotten to remove his hairnetat last dumbledore straightened upshes not dead argus he said softlylockhart stopped abruptly in the middle of counting the number ofmurders he had preventednot dead choked filch looking through his fingers at mrs norrisbut whys she all all stiff and frozenshe has been petrified said dumbledore ah i thought so saidlockhart but how i cannot say ask him shrieked filch turning his blotched and tearstained face toharryno second year could have done this said dumbledore firmly itwould take dark magic of the most advanced he did it he did it filch spat his pouchy face purpling you sawwhat he wrote on the wall he found in my office he knows im a im a filchs face worked horribly he knows im a squib hefinishedi never touched mrs norris harry said loudly uncomfortablyaware of everyone looking at him including all the lockharts on thewalls and i dont even know what a squib isrubbish snarled filch he saw my kwikspell letterif i might speak headmaster said snape from the shadows andharrys sense of forboding increased he was sure nothing snape hadto say was going to do him any goodpotter and his friends may have simply been in the wrong place at thewrong time he said a slight sneer curling his mouth as though hedoubted it but we do have a set of suspicious circumstances herewhy was he in the upstairs corridor at all why wasnt he at thehalloween feastharry ron and hermione all launched into an explanation about thedeathday party there were hundreds of ghosts theyll tell you we werethere but why not join the feast afterward said snape his black eyesglittering in the candlelight why go up to that corridorron and hermione looked at harrybecause because harry said his heart thumping very fastsomething told him it would sound very farfetched if he told them hehad been led there by a bodiless voice no one but he could hearbecause we were tired and wanted to go to bed he saidwithout any supper said snape a triumphant smile flickering acrosshis gaunt face i didnt think ghosts provided food fit for living peopleat their partieswe werent hungry said ron loudly as his stomach gave a hugerumblesnapes nasty smile widenedi suggest headmaster that potter is not being entirely truthful hesaid it might be a good idea if he were deprived of certain privilegesuntil he is ready to tell us the whole story i personally feel he shouldbe taken off the gryffindor quidditch team until he is ready to behonestreally severus said professor mcgonagall sharply i see noreason to stop the boy playing quidditch this cat wasnt hit over thehead with a broomstick there is no evidence at all that potter hasdone anything wrongdumbledore was giving harry a searching look his twinkling lightbluegaze made harry feel as though he were being xrayedinnocent until proven guilty severus he said firmlysnape looked furious so did filchmy cat has been petrified he shrieked his eyes popping i want tosee some punishmentwe will be able to cure her argus said dumbledore patientlyprofesser sprout recently managed to procure some mandrakes assoon as they have reached their full size i will have a potion made thatwill revive mrs norrisill make it lockhart butted in i must have done it a hundred timesi could whip up a mandrake restorative draught in my sleep excuse me said snape icily but i believe i am the potions masterat this schoolthere was a very awkward pauseyou may go dumbledore said to harry ron and hermionethey went as quickly as they could without actually running whenthey were a floor up from lockharts office they turned intoan empty classroom and closed the door quietly behind them harrysquinted at his friends darkened facesdyou think i should have told them about that voice i heardno said ron without hesitation hearing voices no one else canhear isnt a good sign even in the wizarding worldsomething in rons voice made harry ask you do believe me dontyoucourse i do said ron quickly but you must admit its weird i know its weird said harry the whole things weird what wasthat writing on the wall about the cbamber has been openedwhats that supposed to meanyou know it rings a sort of bell said ron slowly i think someonetold me a story about a secret chamber at hogwarts once mightvebeen bill and what on earths a squib said harryto his surprise ron stifled a sniggerwell its not funny really but as its filch he said a squib issomeone who was born into a wizarding family but hasnt got anymagic powers kind of the opposite of muggleborn wizards butsquibs are quite unusual if filchs trying to learn magic from akwikspell course i reckon he must be a squib it would explain a lotlike why he hates students so much ron gave a satisfied smilehes bittera clock chimed somewheremidnight said harry wed better get to bed before snape comesalong and tries to frame us for something elsefor a few days the school could talk of little else but the attack onmrs norris filch kept it fresh in everyones minds by pacing the spotwhere she had been attacked as though he thought the attacker mightcome back harry had seen him scrubbing the message on the wallwith mrs skowers allpurpose magical mess remover but to noeffect the words still gleamed as brightly as ever on the stone whenfilch wasnt guarding the scene of the crime he was skulking redeyedthrough the corridors lunging out at unsuspecting students andtrying to put them in detention for things like breathing loudly andlooking happyginny weasley seemed very disturbed by mrs norriss fateaccording to ron she was a great cat loverbut you havent really got to know mrs norris ron told herbracingly honestly were much better off without her ginnys liptrembled stuff like this doesnt often happen at hogwarts ronassured her theyll catch the maniac who did it and have him out ofhere in no time i just hope hes got time to petrify filch before hesexpelled im only joking ron added hastily as ginny blanchedthe attack had also had an effect on hermione it was quite usual forhermione to spend a lot of time reading but she was now doingalmost nothing else nor could harry and ron get much responsefrom her when they asked what she was up to and not until thefollowing wednesday did they find outharry had been held back in potions where snape had made him staybehind to scrape tubeworms off the desks after a hurried lunch hewent upstairs to meet ron in the library and saw justin finchfletchley the hufflepuff boy from herbology comingtoward him harry had just opened his mouth to say hello when justincaught sight of him turned abruptly and sped off in the oppositedirectionharry found ron at the back of the library measuring his history ofmagic homework professor binns had asked for a threefootlongcomposition on the medieval assembly of europeanwizardsi dont believe it im still eight inches short said ron furiously letting go of his parchment which sprang back into a rolland hermiones done four feet seven inches and her writingstiny where is she asked harry grabbing the tape measure and unrollinghis own homeworksomewhere over there said ron pointing along the shelves lookingfor another book i think shes trying to read the whole library beforechristmasharry told ron about justin finchfletchley running away from himdunno why you care i thought he was a bit of an idiot said ronscribbling away making his writing as large as possible all that junkabout lockhart being so great hermione emerged from between the bookshelves she looked irritableand at last seemed ready to talk to themall the copies of hogwarts a history have been taken out she saidsitting down next to harry and ron and theres a twoweek waitinglist i wish i hadnt left my copy at home but i couldnt fit it in my trunkwith all the lockhart bookswhy do you want it said harrythe same reason everyone else wants it said hermione to readup on the legend of the chamber of secretswhats that said harry quicklythats just it i cant remember said hermione biting her lip andi cant find the story anywhere else hermione let me read your composition said ron desperatelychecking his watchno i wont said hermione suddenly severe youve had tendays to finish it i only need another two inches come on the bell rang ron and hermione led the way to history of magicbickeringhistory of magic was the dullest subject on their schedule professorbinns who taught it was their only ghost teacher and the mostexciting thing that ever happened in his classes was his entering theroom through the blackboard ancient and shriveled many peoplesaid he hadnt noticed he was dead he had simply got up to teachone day and left his body behind him in an armchair in front of thestaff room fire his routine had not varied in the slightest sincetoday was as boring as ever professor binns opened his notes andbegan to read in a flat drone like an old vacuum cleaner until nearlyeveryone in the class was in a deep stupor occasionally coming tolong enough to copy down a name or date then falling asleep againhe had been speaking for half an hour when something happenedthat had never happened before hermione put up her handprofessor binns glancing up in the middle of a deadly dull lecture on the international warlock convention of looked amazedmiss er granger professor i was wondering if you could tell us anythingabout the chamber of secrets said hermione in a clear voicedean thomas who had been sitting with his mouth hanging opengazing out of the window jerked out of his trance lavender brownshead came up off her arms and neville longbottoms elbow slippedoff his deskprofessor binns blinkedmy subject is history of magic he said in his dry wheezy voice ideal with facts miss granger not myths and legends he cleared histhroat with a small noise like chalk sping and continued inseptember of that year a subcommittee of sardinian sorcerershe stuttered to a halt hermiones hand was waving in the air againmiss grantplease sir dont legends always have a basis in factprofessor binns was looking at her in such amazement harry wassure no student had ever interrupted him before alive or deadwell said professor binns slowly yes one could argue that isuppose he peered at hermione as though he had never seen astudent properly before however the legend of which you speak issuch a very sensational even ludicrous tale but the whole class was now hanging on professor binnss everyword he looked dimly at them all every face turned to his harrycould tell he was completely thrown by such an unusual show ofinterestoh very well he said slowly let me see the chamber ofsecrets you all know of course that hogwarts was founded over a thousandyears ago the precise date is uncertain by the four greatest witchesand wizards of the age the four school houses are named afterthem godric gryffindor helga hufflepuff rowena ravenclaw andsalazar slytherin they built this castle together far from pryingmuggle eyes for it was an age when magic was feared by commonpeople and witches and wizards suffered much persecutionhe paused gazed blearily around the room and continuedfor a few years the founders worked in harmony together seekingout youngsters who showed signs of magic and bringing them to thecastle to be educated but then disagreements sprang up betweenthem a rift began to grow between slytherin and the others slytherinwished to be more selective about the students admitted to hogwarts hebelieved that magical learning should be kept within allmagic familieshe disliked taking students of muggle parentage believing them to beuntrustworthy after a while there was a serious argument on thesubject between slytherin and gryffindor and slytherin left theschoolprofessor binns paused again pursing his lips looking like a wrinkledold tortoisereliable historical sources tell us this much he said but thesehonest facts have been obscured by the fanciful legend of thechamber of secrets the story goes that slytherin had built ahidden chamber in the castle of which the other founders knewnothingslytherin according to the legend sealed the chamber of secretsso that none would be able to open it until his own true heir arrived atthe school the heir alone would be able to unseal the chamber ofsecrets unleash the horror within and use it to purge the school ofall who were unworthy to study magicthere was silence as he finished telling the story but it wasnt theusual sleepy silence that filled professor binnss classes there wasunease in the air as everyone continued to watch him hoping formore professor binns looked faintly annoyedthe whole thing is arrant nonsense of course he said naturallythe school has been searched for evidence of such a chamber manytimes by the most learned witches and wizards it does not exist atale told to frighten the gulliblehermiones hand was back in the airsir what exactly do you mean by the horror within thechamberthat is believed to be some sort of monster which the heir ofslytherin alone can control said professor binns in his dry reedyvoicethe class exchanged nervous looksi tell you the thing does not exist said professor binns shuffling hisnotes there is no chamber and no monsterbut sir said seamus finnigan if the chamber can only be openedby slytherins true heir no one else would be able to find it wouldtheynonsense oflaherty said professor binns in an aggravatedtone if a long succession of hogwarts headmasters andheadmistresses havent found the thing but professor piped up parvati patil youd probably have to usedark magic to open it just because a wizard doesnt use dark magic doesnt mean hecant miss pennyfeather snapped professor binns i repeat if thelikes of dumbledore but maybe youve got to be related to slytherin so dumbledorecouldnt began dean thomas but professor binns had hadenoughthat will do he said sharply it is a myth it does not exist thereis not a shred of evidence that slytherin ever built so much as asecret broom cupboard i regret telling you such a foolish story wewill return if you please to history to solid believable verifiablefactand within five minutes the class had sunk back into its usual torpori always knew salazar slytherin was a twisted old loony ron toldharry and hermione as they fought their way through the teemingcorridors at the end of the lesson to drop off their bags beforedinner but i never knew he started all this pureblood stuff iwouldnt be in his house if you paid me honestly if the sorting hathad tried to put me in slytherin idve got the train straight backhome hermione nodded fervently but harry didnt say anything hisstomach had just dropped unpleasantlyharry had never told ron and hermione that the sorting hathad seriously considered putting him in slytherin he could rememberas though it were yesterday the small voice that had spoken in his earwhen hed placed the hat on his head a year before you could be greatyou know its all here in your head and slytherin would help you on theway to greatness no doubt about thatbut harry who had already heard of slytherin houses reputation for turning out dark wizards had thought desperately notslytherin and the hat had said oh well if youre sure better begryffindoras they were shunted along in the throng colin creevy went pasthiya harryhullo colin said harry automaticallyharry harry a boy in my class has been saying yourebut colin was so small he couldnt fight against the tide of peoplebearing him toward the great hall they heard him squeak see youharry and he was gonewhats a boy in his class saying about you hermione wonderedthat im slytherins heir i expect said harry his stomach droppinganother inch or so as he suddenly remembered the way justin finchfletchley had run away from him at lunchtimepeople herell believe anything said ron in disgustthe crowd thinned and they were able to climb the next staircasewithout difficultydyou really think theres a chamber of secrets ron askedhermionei dont know she said frowning dumbledore couldnt curemrs norris and that makes me think that whatever attacked hermight not be well humanas she spoke they turned a corner and found themselves at the endof the very corridor where the attack had happened they stoppedand looked the scene was just as it had been that night except thatthere was no stiff cat hanging from the torch bracket and an emptychair stood against the wall bearing the message the chamber ofsecrets has been openedthats where filch has been keeping guard ron mutteredthey looked at each other the corridor was desertedcant hurt to have a poke around said harry dropping his bag andgetting to his hands and knees so that he could crawl along searchingfor cluesscorch marks he said here and here come and look at this said hermione this is funny harry got up and crossed to the window next to the message on thewall hermione was pointing at the topmost pane where aroundtwenty spiders were scuttling apparently fighting to get through asmall crack a long silvery thread was dangling like a rope as thoughthey had all climbed it in their hurry to get outsidehave you ever seen spiders act like that said hermionewonderinglyno said harry have you ron ronhe looked over his shoulder ron was standing well back and seemedto be fighting the impulse to runwhats up said harryi dont like spiders said ron tenselyi never knew that said hermione looking at ron in surpriseyouve used spiders in potions loads of times i dont mind them dead said ron who was carefully lookinganywhere but at the window i just dont like the way they move hermione giggledits not funny said ron fiercely if you must know when i wasthree fred turned my my teddy bear into a great big fiithy spiderbecause i broke his toy broomstick you wouldnt like them either ifyoud been holding your bear and suddenly it had too many legs and he broke off shuddering hermione was obviously still trying not tolaugh feeling they had better get off the subject harry saidremember all that water on the floor where did that come fromsomeones mopped it upit was about here said ron recovering himself to walk a few pacespast filchs chair and pointing level with this doorhe reached for the brass doorknob but suddenly withdrew his hand asthough hed been burnedwhats the matter said harrycant go in there said ron gruffly thats a girls toiletoh ron there wont be anyone in there said hermione standing upand coming over thats moaning myrtles place come on lets havea lookand ignoring the large out of order sign she opened the doorit was the gloomiest most depressing bathroom harry had ever setfoot in under a large cracked and spotted mirror were a row ofchipped sinks the floor was damp and reflected the dull light givenoff by the stubs of a few candles burning low in their holders thewooden doors to the stalls were flaking and scratched and one ofthem was dangling off its hingesl hermione put her fingers to her lips and set off toward the end stallwhen she reached it she said hello myrtle how are youharry and ron went to look moaning myrtle was floating above thetank of the toilet picking a spot on her chinthis is a girls bathroom she said eyeing ron and harry suspiciouslytheyre not girlsno hermione agreed i just wanted to show them how er nice it isin hereshe waved vaguely at the dirty old mirror and the damp floorask her if she saw anything harry mouthed at hermionewhat are you whispering said myrtle staring at himnothing said harry quickly we wanted to ask i wish people would stop talking behind my back said myrtle in avoice choked with tears i do have feelings you know even if i amdead myrtle no one wants to upset you said hermione harry only no one wants to upset me thats a good one howled myrtle mylife was nothing but misery at this place and now people come alongruining my deathwe wanted to ask you if youve seen anything funny lately saidhermione quickly because a cat was attacked right outside yourfront door on halloweendid you see anyone near here that night said harryi wasnt paying attention said myrtle dramatically peeves upset meso much i came in here and tried to kill myself then of course iremembered that im that im already dead said ron helpfullyil myrtle gave a tragic sob rose up in the air turned over and divedheadfirst into the toilet splashing water all over them and vanishingfrom sight although from the direction of her muffled sobs she hadcome to rest somewhere in the ubendharry and ron stood with their mouths open but hermione shruggedwearily and said honestly that was almost cheerful for myrtle come on lets goharry had barely closed the door on myrtles gurgling sobs when aloud voice made all three of them jumpronpercy weasley had stopped dead at the head of the stairs prefectbadge agleam an expression of complete shock on his facethats a girls bathroom he gasped what were you just having a look around ron shrugged clues you know percy swelled in a manner that reminded harry forcefully of mrsweasleyget away from there perry said striding toward them andstarting to bustle them along flapping his arms dont you care whatthis looks like coming back here while everyones at dinner why shouldnt we be here said ron hotly stopping short and glaringat percy listen we never laid a finger on that catthats what i told ginny said percy fiercely but she still seems tothink youre going to be expelled ive never seen her so upset cryingher eyes out you might think of her all the first years are thoroughlyoverexcited by this business you dont care about ginny said ron whose ears were nowreddening youre just worried im going to mess up your chances ofbeing head boy five points from gryffindor percy said tersely fingering his prefectbadge and i hope it teaches you a lesson no more detective work orill write to mumand he strode off the back of his neck as red as rons earsharry ron and hermione chose seats as far as possible from percyin the common room that night ron was still in a very bad temper andkept blotting his charms homework when he reached absently for hiswand to remove the smudges it ignited the parchment fuming almostas much as his homework ron slammed the standard book of spellsgrade shut to harrys surprise hermione followed suitwho can it be though she said in a quiet voice as thoughcontinuing a conversation they had just been having whod want tofrighten all the squibs and muggleborns out of hogwartslets think said ron in mock puzzlement who do we know whothinks muggleborns are scumhe looked at hermione hermione looked back unconvincedif youre talking about malfoy of course i am said ron you heard him youll be nextmudbloods come on youve only got to look at his foul rat face toknow its him malfoy the heir of slytherin said hermione skepticallylook at his family said harry closing his books too the whole lotof them have been in slytherin hes always boasting about it theycould easily be slytherins descendants his fathers definitely evilenoughthey couldve had the key to the chamber of secrets for centuriessaid ron handing it down father to son well said hermione cautiously i suppose its possible but how do we prove it said harry darklythere might be a way said hermione slowly dropping her voice stillfurther with a quick glance across the room at percy of course itwould be difficult and dangerous very dangerous wed be breakingabout fifty school rules i expect if in a month or so you feel like explaining you will let us knowwont you said ron irritablyall right said hermione coldly what wed need to do is to getinside the slytherin common room and ask malfoy a few questionswithout him realizing its usbut thats impossible harry said as ron laughedno its not said hermione all wed need would be some polyjuicepotionwhats that said ron and harry togethersnape mentioned it in class a few weeks ago dyou think weve got nothing better to do in potions than listen tosnape muttered ronit transforms you into somebody else think about it we couldchange into three of the slytherins no one would know it was usmalfoy would probably tell us anything hes probably boasting about itin the slytherin common room right now if only we could hear himthis polyjuice stuff sounds a bit dodgy to me said ron frowningwhat if we were stuck looking like three of the slytherins foreverit wears off after a while said hermione waving her handimpatiently but getting hold of the recipe will be very difficultsnape said it was in a book called moste potente potions and itsbound to be in the restricted section of the librarythere was only one way to get out a book from the restrictedsection you needed a signed note of permission from a teacherhard to see why wed want the book really said ron if wewerent going to try and make one of the potionsi think said hermione that if we made it sound as thoughwe were just interested in the theory we might stand a chance oh come on no teachers going to fall for that said rontheyd have to be really thick c hh a p t v it t nthe rogue bludgerince the disastrous episode of the pixies professor lockhart had notbrought live creatures to class instead he read passages from hisbooks to them and sometimes reenacted some of the more dramaticbits he usually picked harry to help him with these reconstructionsso far harry had been forced to play a simple transylvanian villagerwhom lockhart had cured of a babbling curse a yeti with a headcold and a vampire who had been unable to eat anything exceptlettuce since lockhart had dealt with himharry was hauled to the front of the class during their very nextdefense against the dark arts lesson this time acting a werewolf ifhe hadnt had a very good reason for keeping lockhart in a goodmood he would have refused to do itnice loud howl harry exactly and then if youll believe it ipounced like this slammed him to the floor thus with one hand imanaged to hold him down with my other iput my wand to his throat i then screwed up my remaining strengthand performed the immensely complex homorphus charm he letout a piteous moan go on harry higher than that good the furvanished the fangs shrank and he turned back into a man simpleyet effective and another village will remember me forever as thehero who delivered them from the monthly terror of werewolfattacksthe bell rang and lockhart got to his feethomework compose a poem about my defeat of the waggawagga werewolf signed copies of magical me to the author of thebest onethe class began to leave harry returned to the back of the roomwhere ron and hermione were waitingready harry mutteredwait till everyones gone said hermione nervously all right she approached lockharts desk a piece of paper clutched tightly inher hand harry and ron right behind herer professor lockhart hermione stammered i wanted to toget this book out of the library just for background reading sheheld out the piece of paper her hand shaking slightly but the thingis its in the restricted section of the library so i need a teacher tosign for it im sure it would help me understand what you say ingadding with ghouls about slowacting venomsah gadding with ghouls said lockhart taking the note fromhermione and smiling widely at her possibly my very favoritebook you enjoyed itoh yes said hermione eagerly so clever the way you trapped thatlast one with the teastrainer well im sure no one will mind me giving the best student of the yeara little extra help said lockhart warmly and he pulled out anenormous peacock quill yes nice isnt it he said misreading therevolted look on rons face i usually save it for booksigningshe scrawled an enormous loopy signature on the note and handed itback to hermioneso harry said lockhart while hermione folded the note withfumbling fingers and slipped it into her bag tomorrows the firstquidditch match of the season i believe gryffindor against slytherinis it not i hear youre a useful player i was a seeker too i wasasked to try for the national squad but preferred to dedicate my lifeto the eradication of the dark forces still if ever you feel the needfor a little private training dont hesitate to ask always happy to passon my expertise to less able players harry made an indistinct noise in his throat and then hurried off afterron and hermionei dont believe it he said as the three of them examined the signatureon the note he didnt even look at the book we wantedthats because hes a brainless git said ron but who cares wevegot what we needed he is not a brainless git said hermione shrilly as they half rantoward the libraryjust because he said you were the best student of the year they dropped their voices as they entered the muffled stillness of thelibrary madam pince the librarian was a thin irritable woman wholooked like an underfed vulturemoste potente potions she repeated suspiciously trying to take thenote from hermione but hermione wouldnt let goi was wondering if i could keep it she said breathlesslyoh come on said ron wrenching it from her grasp and thrusting itat madam pince well get you another autograph lockhartll signanything if it stands still long enoughmadam pince held the note up to the light as though determined todetect a forgery but it passed the test she stalked away between thelofty shelves and returned several minutes later carrying a large andmoldylooking book hermione put it carefully into her bag and theyleft trying not to walk too quickly or look too guiltyfive minutes later they were barricaded in moaning myrtles outoforderbathroom once again hermione had overridden rons objectionsby pointing out that it was the last place anyone in their right mindswould go so they were guaranteed some privacy moaning myrtlewas crying noisily in her stall but they were ignoring her and shethemhermione opened moste potente potions carefully and the three ofthem bent over the dampspotted pages it was clear from a glancewhy it belonged in the restricted section some of the potions hadeffects almost too gruesome to think about and there were some veryunpleasant illustrations which included a man who seemed to havebeen turned inside out and a witch sprouting several extra pairs ofarms out of her headhere it is said hermione excitedly as she found the page headed thepolyjuice potion it was decorated with drawings of people halfwaythrough transforming into other people harry sincerely hoped the artist had imagined the looks of intense pain on theirfacesthis is the most complicated potion ive ever seen said hermione asthey scanned the recipe lacewing flies leeches fluxweed andknotgrass she murmured running her finger down the list ofingredients well theyre easy enough theyre in the student storecupboardwe can help ourselves oooh look powdered horn of abicorn dont know where were going to get that shredded skin of aboomslang thatll be tricky too and of course a bit of whoever wewant to change intoexcuse me said ron sharply what dyou mean a bit of whoeverwere changing into im drinking nothing with crabbes toenails in it hermione continued as though she hadnt heard himwe dont have to worry about that yet though because we add thosebits last ron turned speechless to harry who had another worrydyou realize how much were going to have to steal hermioneshredded skin of a boomslang thats definitely not in the studentscupboard whatre we going to do break into snapes private stores idont know if this is a good idea hermione shut the book with a snapwell if you two are going to chicken out fine she said there werebright pink patches on her cheeks and her eyes were brighter thanusual i dont want to break rules you know i think threateningmuggleborns is far worse than brewing up a difficult potion but ifyou dont want to find out if its malfoy ill go straight to madam pincenow and hand the book back in i never thought id see the day when youd be persuading us tobreak rules said ron all right well do it but not toenails okayhow long will it take to make anyway said harry as hermionelooking happier opened the book againwell since the fluxweed has got to be picked at the full moon andthe lacewings have got to be stewed for twentyone days id sayitd be ready in about a month if we can get all the ingredientsa month said ron malfoy could have attacked half the mugglebornsin the school by then but hermiones eyes narroweddangerously again and he added swiftly but its the best plan wevegot so full steam ahead i sayhowever while hermione was checking that the coast was clear forthem to leave the bathroom ron muttered to harry itll be a lot lesshassle if you can just knock malfoy off his broom tomorrowharry woke early on saturday morning and lay for a while thinkingabout the coming quidditch match he was nervous mainly at thethought of what wood would say if gryffindor lost but also at theidea of facing a team mounted on the fastest racing brooms goldcould buy he had never wanted to beat slytherin so badly afterhalf an hour of lying there with his insides churning he got updressed and went down to breakfast early where he found the restof the gryffindor team huddled at the long empty table all lookinguptight and not speaking muchas eleven oclock approached the whole school started to make itsway down to the quidditch stadium it was a muggy sort of daywith a hint of thunder in the air ron and hermione came hurryingover to wish harry good luck as he entered the locker rooms theteam pulled on their scarlet gryffindor robes then sat down to listen towoods usual prematch pep talkslytherin has better brooms than us he began no point denying itbut weve got better people on our brooms weve trained harder thanthey have weve been flying in all weathers too true mutteredgeorge weasley i havent been properly dry since august andwere going to make them rue the day they let that little bit of slimemalfoy buy his way onto their teamchest heaving with emotion wood turned to harryitll be down to you harry to show them that a seeker has to havesomething more than a rich father get to that snitch before malfoy ordie trying harry because weve got to win today weve got toso no pressure harry said fred winking at himas they walked out onto the pitch a roar of noise greeted them mainlycheers because ravenclaw and hufflepuff were anxious to seeslytherin beaten but the slytherins in the crowd made their boos andhisses heard too madam hooch the quidditch teacher asked flintand wood to shake hands which they did giving each otherthreatening stares and gripping rather harder than was necessaryon my whistle said madam hooch three two one with a roar from the crowd to speed them upward the fourteenplayers rose toward the leaden sky harry flew higher than any ofthem squinting around for the snitchall right there scarhead yelled malfoy shooting underneath him asthough to show off the speed of his broomharry had no time to reply at that very moment a heavy blackbludger came pelting toward him he avoided it so narrowly that hefelt it ruffle his hair as it passedclose one harry said george streaking past him with his club in hishand ready to knock the bludger back toward a slytherin harry sawgeorge give the bludger a powerful whack in the direction of adrianpucey but the bludger changed direction in midair and shot straightfor harry againharry dropped quickly to avoid it and george managed to hit it hardtoward malfoy once again the bludger swerved like a boomerangand shot at harrys headharry put on a burst of speed and zoomed toward the other end of thepitch he could hear the bludger whistling along behind him whatwas going on bludgers never concentrated on one player like this itwas their job to try and unseat as many people as possible fred weasley was waiting for the bludger at the other end harryducked as fred swung at the bludger with all his might the bludgerwas knocked off coursegotcha fred yelled happily but he was wrong as though it wasmagnetically attracted to harry the bludger pelted after him oncemore and harry was forced to fly off at full speedit had started to rain harry felt heavy drops fall onto his facesplattering onto his glasses he didnt have a clue what was going onin the rest of the game until he heard lee jordan who wascommentating say slytherin lead sixty points to zero the slytherins superior brooms were clearly doing their jobs andmeanwhile the mad bludger was doing all it could to knock harryout of the air fred and george were now flying so close to him oneither side that harry could see nothing at all except their flailing armsand had no chance to look for the snitch let alone catch itsomeones tampered with this bludger fred gruntedswinging his bat with all his might at it as it launched a new attack onharrywe need time out said george trying to signal to wood and stopthe bludger breaking harrys nose at the same timewood had obviously got the message madam hoochs whistle rangout and harry fred and george dived for the ground still trying toavoid the mad bludgerwhats going on said wood as the

ownthe rain was falling more heavily now on madam hoochs whistleharry kicked hard into the air and heard the telltale whoosh of thebludger behind him higher and higher harry climbed he looped andswooped spiraled zigzagged and rolled slightly dizzy he neverthelesskept his eyes wide open rain was speckling his glasses and ran up hisnostrils as he hung upside down avoiding another fierce dive from thebludger he could hear laughter from the crowd he knew he mustlook very stupid but the rogue bludger was heavy and couldnt changedirection as quickly as harry could he began a kind of rollercoasterride around theedges of the stadium squinting through the silver sheets of rain to thegryffindor goal posts where adrian pucey was trying to get pastwooda whistling in harrys ear told him the bludger had just missed himagain he turned right over and sped in the opposite directiontraining for the ballet potter yelled malfoy as harry was forced todo a stupid kind of twirl in midair to dodge the bludger and he fled thebludger trailing a few feet behind him and then glaring back atmalfoy in hatred he saw it the golden snitch it was hovering inchesabove malfoys left ear and malfoy busy laughing at harry hadntseen itfor an agonizing moment harry hung in midair not daring to speedtoward malfoy in case he looked up and saw the snitchwhamhe had stayed still a second too long the bludger had hit him at lastsmashed into his elbow and harry felt his arm break dimly dazed bythe searing pain in his arm he slid sideways on his raindrenchedbroom one knee still crooked over it his right arm dangling useless athis side the bludger came pelting back for a second attack this timewming at his face harry swerved out of the way one idea firmlylodged in his numb brain get to malfoythrough a haze of rain and pain he dived for the shimmering sneeringface below him and saw its eyes widen with fear malfoy thoughtharry was attacking himwhat the he gasped careening out of harrys wayharry took his remaining hand off his broom and made a wild snatchhe felt his fingers close on the cold snitch but was now onlygripping the broom with his legs and there was a yell from the crowdbelow as he headed straight for the ground trying hard not to passoutwith a splattering thud he hit the mud and rolled off his broom hisarm was hanging at a very strange angle riddled with pain he heardas though from a distance a good deal of whistling and shouting hefocused on the snitch clutched in his good handaha he said vaguely weve wonand he faintedhe came around rain falling on his face still lying on the field withsomeone leaning over him he saw a glitter of teethoh no not you he moaneddoesnt know what hes saying said lockhart loudly to the anxiouscrowd of gryffindors pressing

fred andgeorge weasley wrestling the rogue bludger into a box it was stillputting up a terrific fightstand back said lockhart who was rolling up his jadegreensleevesno dont said harry weakly but lockhart was twirling his wandand a second later had directed it straight at harrys arma strange and unpleasant sensation started at harrys shoulder andspread all the way down to his fingertips it felt as though his arm wasbeing deflated he didnt dare look at what was happening he hadshut his eyes his face turned away from his arm but his worst fearswere realized as the people above him gasped and colin creeveybegan clicking away madly his arm didnt hurt anymore nor did itfeel remotely like an armah said lockhart yes well that can sometimes happen but thepoint is the bones are no longer broken thats the thing to bear inmind so harry just toddle up to the hospital wing ah mr weasleymiss granger would you escort him and madam pomfrey will beable to er tidy you up a bitas harry got to his feet he felt strangely lopsided taking a deepbreath he looked down at his right side what he saw nearly made himpass out againpoking out of the end of his robes was what looked like a thick fleshcoloredrubber glove he tried to move his fingers nothing happenedlockhart hadnt mended harrys bones he had removed themmadam pomfrey wasnt at all pleasedyou should have come straight to me she raged holding upthe sad limp remainder of what half an hour before had been aworking arm i can mend bones in a second but growing them back you will be able to wont you said harry desperatelyill be

eyes on the dark doorway to the hospital wing as thefootsteps drew nearernext moment dumbledore was backing into the dormitory wearing along woolly dressing gown and a nightcap he was carrying one endof what looked like a statue professor mcgonagall appeared asecond later carrying its feet together they heaved it onto a bedget madam pomfrey whispered dumbledore and professormcgonagall hurried past the end of harrys bed out of sight harry layquite still pretending to be asleep he heard urgent voices and thenprofessor mcgonagall swept back into view closely followed bymadam pomfrey who was pulling a cardigan on over her nightdresshe heard a sharp intake of breathwhat happened madam pomfrey whispered to dumbledorebending over the statue on the bedlanother attack said dumbledore minerva found him on the stairsthere was a bunch of grapes next to him said professormcgonagall we think he was trying to sneak up here to visit potterharrys stomach gave a horrible lurch slowly and carefully he raisedhimself a few inches so he could look at the statue on the bed a rayof moonlight lay across its staring faceit was colin creevey his eyes were wide and his hands were stuckup in front of him holding his camerapetrified whispered madam pomfreyyes said professor mcgonagall but i shudder to think if albushadnt been on the way downstairs for hot chocolate who knowswhat might have the three of

eagerlydumbledore didnt answer he opened the back of the cameragood gracious said madam pomfreya jet of steam had hissed out of the camera harry three beds awaycaught the acrid smell of burnt

clapped a hand to her mouth professor mcgonagallstared at dumbledorebut albus surely whothe question is not who said dumbledore his eyes on colinthe question is how and from what harry could see of professor mcgonagalls shadowy face she didnt understand this any better than he didc hh a p t t r eleventhe dkjeling clijibharry woke up on sunday morning to find the dormitory blazing withwinter sunlight and his arm reboned but very stiff he sat up quicklyand looked over at colins bed but it had been blocked from view bythe high curtains harry had changed behind yesterday seeing that hewas

finished eating you may leaveharry dressed as quickly as he could and hurried off to gryffindortower desperate to tell ron and hermione about colin and dobbybut they werent there harry left to look

straight for moaning myrtles bathroom he couldnt see whyron and hermione would be in there again but after making surethat neither filch nor any prefects were around he opened the doorand heard their voices coming from a locked stallits me he said closing the door behind him there was a clunk asplash and a gasp from within the stall and he saw hermiones eyepeering through the keyholeharry she said you gave us such a fright come in hows yourarmfine said harry squeezing into the stall an old cauldron wasperched on the toilet and a crackling from under the rim told harrythey had lit a fire beneath

though i want to know how come nobodysnoticed it sneaking around the schoolmaybe it can make itself invisible said hermione prodding leeches tothe bottom of the cauldron or maybe it can disguise itself pretend tobe a suit of armor or something ive read about chameleon ghouls you read too much hermione said ron pouring dead lacewings ontop of the leeches he crumpled up the empty lacewing bag and lookedat harryso dobby stopped us from getting on the train and broke yourarm he shook his head you know what harry if he doesntstop trying to save your life hes going to kill youthe news that colin creevey had been attacked and was now lyingas though dead in the hospital wing had spread through the entireschool by monday morning the air was suddenly thick with rumorand suspicion the first

harry felt that fred and george were going thewrong way about cheering her up they were taking turns coveringthemselves with fur or boils and jumping out at her from behindstatues they only stopped when percy apoplectic with rage toldthem he was going to write to mrs weasley and tell her ginny washaving nightmaresmeanwhile hidden from the teachers a roaring trade in talismansamulets and other protective devices was sweeping the schoolneville longbottom bought a large evilsmelling green onion apointed purple crystal and a rotting newt tail before the othergryffindor boys pointed out that he

professor mcgonagall camearound as usual collecting names of those who would be staying atschool for christmas harry ron and hermione signed her list theyhad heard that malfoy was staying which struck them as verysuspicious the holidays would be the perfect time to use thepolyjuice potion and try to worm a confession out of himunfortunately the potion was only half finished they stillneeded the bicorn horn and the boomslang skin and the only placethey were going to get them was from snapes private stores harryprivately felt hed rather face slytherins legendary monster than letsnape catch him

and jars of ingredients snape prowled through the fumesmaking waspish remarks about the gryffindors work while theslytherins sniggered appreciatively draco malfoy who was snapesfavorite student kept flicking pufferfish eyes at ron and harry whoknew that if they retaliated they would get detention faster than youcould say unfairharrys swelling solution was far too runny but he had his mind onmore important things he was waiting for hermiones signal and hehardly listened as snape paused to sneer at his waterypotion when snape turned and walked off to bully neville hermionecaught harrys eye and noddedharry ducked swiftly down behind his cauldron pulled one of fredsfilibuster fireworks out of his pocket and gave it a quick prod with hiswand the firework began to fizz and sputter knowing he

swelling solution hit them malfoy got a faceful andhis nose began to swell like a balloon goyle blundered around hishands over his eyes which had expanded to the size of a dinner plate snape was trying to restore calm and find out what had happenedthrough the confusion harry saw hermione slip quietly into snapesofficesilence silence snape roared anyone who has been splashedcome here for a deflating draft when i find out who did this harry tried not to laugh as he watched malfoy hurry forward his headdrooping with the weight of a nose like a small melon as half theclass lumbered up to snapes desk some weighted down with armslike clubs others unable to talk through gigantic puffedup lips harrysaw hermione slide back into the dungeon the front of her robesbulgingwhen everyone had taken a swig of antidote and the various swellingshad subsided snape swept over to goyles cauldron and scooped outthe twisted black remains of the firework there was a sudden hushif i ever find out who threw this snape whispered i shall makesure that person is expelledharry arranged his face into what he hoped was a puzzledexpression snape was looking right at him and the bell that rang tenminutes later could not have been more welcomehe knew it was me harry told ron and hermione as they hurriedback to moaning myrtles bathroom i could tellhermione threw the new ingredients into the cauldron and began tostir feverishlyitll be ready in two weeks she said happilysnape cant prove it was you said ron reassuringly to harrywhat can he doknowing snape something foul said harry as the

goharry and hermione were all for it so at eight oclock thatevening they hurried back to the great hall the long dining tableshad vanished and a golden stage had appeared along one wall lit bythousands of candles floating overhead the ceiling was velvetyblack once more and most of the school seemed to be packedbeneath it all carrying their wands and looking excitedi wonder wholl be teaching us said hermione as they edged intothe chattering crowd someone told me flitwick was a duelingchampion when he was young maybe itll be himas long as its not harry began but he ended on a groangilderoy lockhart was walking onto the stage resplendent in robesof deep plum and accompanied by none other than snape wearinghis usual blacklockhart waved an arm for silence and called gather roundgather round can everyone see me can you all hear meexcellentnow professor dumbledore has granted me permission to startthis little dueling club to train you all in case you ever need to defendyourselves as i myself have done on countless occasions for fulldetails see my published workslet me introduce my assistant professor snape said lockhartflashing a wide smile he tells me he

master when imthrough with him never fearwouldnt it be good if they finished each other off ron muttered inharrys earsnapes upper lip was curling harry wondered why lockhartwas still smiling if snape had been looking at him like that hed havebeen running as fast as he could in the opposite directionlockhart and snape turned to face each other and bowed at leastlockhart did with much twirling of his hands whereas snape jerkedhis head irritably then they raised their wands like swords in front ofthemas you see we are holding our wands in the accepted combativeposition lockhart told the silent crowd on the count of three wewill cast our first spells neither of us will be aiming to kill of coursei wouldnt bet on that harry murmured watching snape baring histeethone two three both of them swung their wands above their heads and pointed themat their opponent snape cried expelliarmus there was a dazzlingflash of scarlet light and lockhart was blasted off his feet he flewbackward off the stage smashed into the wall and slid down it tosprawl on the floormalfoy and some of the other slytherins cheered hermione wasdancing on tiptoes do you think hes all right she squealed throughher fingerswho cares said harry and ron togetherlockhart was getting unsteadily to his feet his hat had fallen off andhis wavy hair was standing on endwell there you have it he said tottering back onto the platformthat was a disarming charm as you see ive lost my wand ahthank you miss brown yes an excellent idea to show them thatprofessor snape but if you dont mind my sayingso it was very obvious what you were about to do if i had wanted tostop you it would have been only too easy however i felt it would beinstructive to let them see snape was looking murderous possibly lockhart had noticed becausehe said enough demonstrating im going to come amongst you nowand put you all into pairs professor snape if youd like to help me they moved through the crowd matching up partners lockhartteamed neville with justin finchfletchley but snape reached harryand ron firsttime to split up the dream team i think he sneered weasley youcan partner finnigan potter harry moved automatically toward hermionei dont think so said snape smiling coldly mr malfoy come overhere lets see what you make of the famous potter and you missgranger you can partner miss bulstrodemalfoy strutted over smirking

rictusempraa jet of silver light hit malfoy in the stomach and he doubled upwheezingi said disarm only lockhart shouted in alarm over the heads of thebattling crowd as malfoy sank to his knees harry had hit him with atickling charm and he could barely move for laughing harry hungback with a vague feeling it would be unsporting to bewitch malfoywhile he was on the floor but this was a mistake gasping for breathmalfoy pointed his wand at harrys knees choked tarantallegraand the next second harrys legs began to jerk around out of hiscontrol in a kind of quickstepstop stop screamed lockhart but snape took chargefinite incantatem he shouted harrys feet stopped dancing malfoystopped laughing and they were able to look upa haze of greenish smoke was hovering over the scene both nevilleand justin were lying on the floor panting ron was holding up anashenfaced seamus apologizing for whatever his broken wand haddone but hermione and millicent bulstrode were still movingmillicent had hermione in a headlock and hermione was whimperingin pain both their wands lay forgotten on the floor harry leaptforward and pulled millicent off it was difficult she was a lot biggerthan he wasdear dear said lockhart skittering through the crowd looking atthe aftermath of the duels up you go macmillan careful there miss fawcett pinch it hard itll stop bleeding in asecond booti think id better teach you how to block unfriendly spells saidlockhart standing flustered in the midst of the hall he glanced atsnape whose black eyes glinted and looked quickly away letshave a volunteer pair longbottom and finchfletchley how aboutyou a bad idea professor lockhart said snape gliding over like a largeand malevolent bat longbottom causes devastation with the simplestspells well be sending whats left of finchfletchley up to thehospital wing in a matchbox nevilles round pink face went pinkerhow about malfoy and potter said snape with a twisted smileexcellent idea said lockhart gesturing harry and malfoy into themiddle of the hall as the crowd backed away to give them roomnow harry said lockhart when draco points his wand at youyou do thishe raised his own wand attempted a complicated sort of wigglingaction and dropped it snape smirked as lockhart quickly picked it upsaying whoops my wand is a little overexcited snape moved closer to malfoy bent down and whispered somethingin his ear malfoy smirked too harry looked up nervously at lockhartand said professor could you show me that blocking thing againscared muttered malfoy so that lockhart couldnt hear himyou wish said harry out of the corner of his mouthlockhart cuffed harry merrily on the shoulder just do what i didharrywhat drop my wandbut lockhart wasnt listeningthree two one go he shoutedmalfoy raised his wand quickly and bellowed serpensortiathe end of his wand exploded harry watched aghast as a long blacksnake shot out of it fell heavily onto the floor between them andraised itself ready to strike there were screams as the crowdbacked swiftly away clearing the floordont move potter said snape lazily clearly enjoying the sight ofharry standing motionless eye to eye with the angry snake ill getrid of it allow me shouted lockhart he brandished his wand at the snakeand there was a loud bang the snake instead of vanishing flew tenfeet into the air and fell back to the floor with a loud smack enragedhissing furiously it slithered straight toward justin finchfletchley andraised itself again fangs exposed poised to strikeharry wasnt sure what made him do it he wasnt even aware ofdeciding to do it all he knew was that his legs were carrying himforward as though he was on casters and that he had shouted stupidlyat the snake leave him alone and miraculously inexplicably thesnake slumped to the floor docile as a thick black garden hose itseyes now on harry harry felt the fear drain out of him he knew thesnake wouldnt attack anyone now though how he knew it he couldnthave explainedhe looked up at justin grinning expecting to see justin lookingrelieved or puzzled or even grateful but certainly not angry andscaredwhat do you think youre playing at he shouted and before harrycould say anything justin had turned and stormed out of the hallsnape stepped forward waved his wand and the snake vanished in asmall puff of black smoke snape too was looking at harry in anunexpected way it was a shrewd and calculating look and harrydidnt like it he was also dimly aware of an ominous muttering allaround the walls then he felt a tugging on the back of his robescome on said rods voice in his ear move come on ron steered him out of the hall hermione hurrying alongside them asthey went through the doors the people on either side drew away asthough they were frightened of catching something harry didnt havea clue what was going on and neither ron nor hermione explainedanything until they had dragged him all the way up to the emptygryffindor common room then ron pushed harry into an armchairand said youre a parselmouth why didnt you tell usim a what said harrya parselmouth said ron you can talk to snakesi know said harry i mean thats only the second time ive everdone it i

had died harry couldnt see what was so terribledyou want to tell me whats wrong with stopping a massive snakebiting off justins head he said what does it matter how i did it aslong as justin doesnt have to join the headless huntit matters said hermione speaking at last in a hushed voicebecause being able to talk to snakes was what salazar slytherin wasfamous for thats why the symbol of slytherin house is a serpentharrys mouth fell openexactly said ron and now the whole schools going to think yourehis greatgreatgreatgreatgrandson or something but im not said harry with a panic he couldnt quite explainyoull find that hard to prove said hermione he lived about athousand years ago for all we know you could beil harry lay awake for hours that night through a gap in the curtainsaround his fourposter he watched snow starting to drift past thetower window and wondered could he be a descendant of salazar slithering he didnt knowanything about his fathers family after all the dursleys had alwaysforbidden questions about his wizarding relativesquietly harry tried to say something in parseltongue the wordswouldnt come it seemed he had to be facetoface with a snake todo itbut im in gryffindor harry thought the sorting hat wouldnthave put me in here if i had slytherin bloodah said a nasty little voice in his brain but the sorting hat wanted toput you in slytherin dont you rememberharry turned over hed see justin the next day in herbology and hedexplain that hed been calling the snake off not egging it on which hethought angrily pummeling his pillow any fool should have realizedby next morning however the snow that had begun in the night hadturned into a blizzard so thick that the last herbology lesson of theterm was canceled professor sprout wanted to fit socks and scarveson the mandrakes a tricky operation she would entrust to no one elsenow that it was so important for the mandrakes to grow quickly andrevive mrs norris and colin creeveyharry fretted about this next to the fire in the gryffindor commonroom while ron and hermione used their time off to play a game ofwizard chessfor heavens sake harry said hermione exasperated as oneof rons bishops wrestled her knight off his horse and dragged him offthe board go and find justin if its so important to youso harry got up and left through the portrait hole wondering wherejustin might bethe castle was darker than it usually was in daytime because of thethick swirling gray snow at every window shivering harry walkedpast classrooms where lessons were taking place catching snatches ofwhat was happening within professor mcgonagall was shouting atsomeone who by the sound of it had turned his friend into a badgerresisting the urge to take a look harry walked on by thinking thatjustin might be using his free time to catch up on some work anddeciding to check the library firsta group of the hufliepuffs who should have been in herbology wereindeed sitting at the back of the library but they didnt seem to beworking between the long lines of high bookshelves harry could seethat their heads were close together and they were having what lookedlike an absorbing conversation he couldnt see whether justin wasamong them he was walking toward them when something of whatthey were saying met his ears and he paused to listen hidden in theinvisibility sectionso anyway a stout boy was saying i told justin to hide up in ourdormitory i mean to say if potters marked him down as his nextvictim its best if he keeps a low profile for a while of course justinsbeen waiting for something like this to happen ever since he let slip topotter he was muggleborn justin actually told him hed been downfor eton thats not the kind of thing you bandy about with slytherinsheir on the loose is ityou definitely think it is potter then ernie said a girl with blondepigtails anxiouslyhannah said the stout boy solemnly hes a parselmouth everyoneknows thats the mark of a dark wizard have you ever heard of adecent one who could talk to snakes they called slytherin himselfserpenttonguethere was some heavy murmuring at this and ernie went onremember what was written on the wall enemies of the heirbeware potter had some sort of runin with filch next thing weknow flichs cats attacked that first year creevey was annoyingpotter at the quidditch match taking pictures of him while he waslying in the mud next thing we know creeveys been attackedhe always seems so nice though said hannah uncertainly andwell hes the one who made youknowwho disappear he cant beall bad can heernie lowered his voice mysteriously the hufflepuffs bent closer andharry edged nearer so that he could catch ernies wordsno one knows how he survived that attack by youknowwho imean to say he was only a baby when it happened he should havebeen blasted into smithereens only a really powerful dark wizardcould have survived a curse like that he dropped his voice until itwas barely more than a whisper and said thats probably why youknowwho wanted to kill him in the first place didnt want anotherdark lord competing with him i wonder what other powers pottersbeen hidingharry couldnt take anymore clearing his throat loudly he stepped outfrom behind the bookshelves if he hadnt been feeling so angry hewould have found the sight that greeted him funny every one of thehufflepuffs looked as though they had been petrified by the sight ofhim and the color was draining out of ernies facehello said harry im looking for justin finchfletchleythe hufepuffs worst fears had clearly been confirmed they alllooked fearfully at erniewhat do you want with him said ernie in a quavering voicei wanted to tell him what really happened with that snake at thedueling club said harryernie bit his white lips and then taking a deep breath said wewere all there we saw what happenedthen you noticed that after i spoke to it the snake backed offsaid harryall i saw said ernie stubbornly though he was trembling as hespoke was you speaking parseltongue and chasing the snaketoward justin i didnt chase it at him harry said his voice shaking with anger itdidnt even touch himit was a very near miss said ernie and in case youre gettingideas he added hastily i might tell you that you can trace myfamily back through nine generations of witches and warlocks andmy bloods as pure as anyones so cc i dont care what sort of blood youve got said harry fiercelywhy would i want to attack mugglebornsive heard you hate those muggles you live with said ernie swiftlyits not possible to live with the dursleys and not hate them saidharry id like to see you try ithe turned on his heel and stormed out of the library earning himselfa reproving glare from madam pince who was polishing the gildedcover of a large spellbookharry blundered up the corridor barely noticing where he was goinghe was in such a fury the result was that he walked into somethingvery large and solid which knocked him backward onto the flooroh hello hagrid harry said looking uphagrids face was entirely hidden by a woolly snowcoveredbalaclava but it couldnt possibly be anyone else as he filled most ofthe corridor in his moleskin overcoat a dead rooster was hangingfrom one of his massive gloved handsall righ harry he said pulling up the balaclava so he couldspeak why arent yeh in classcanceled said harry getting up whatre you doing in herehagrid held up the limp roostersecond one killed this term he explained its either foxes or abloodsuckin bugbear an i need the headmasters permission terput a charm around the hen coophe peered more closely at harry from under his thick snowfleckedeyebrowsyeh sure yehre all righ yeh look all hot an bothered harry couldnt bring himself to repeat what ernie and the rest of thehufflepuffs had been saying about himits nothing he said id better get going hagrid its transfigurationnext and ive got to pick up my bookshe walked off his mind still full of what ernie had said about himjustins been waiting for something like this to happen ever since helet slip to potter he was muggleborn il harry stamped up the stairs and turned along another corridorwhich was particularly dark the torches had been extinguished by astrong icy draft that was blowing through a loose windowpane hewas halfway down the passage when he tripped headlong oversomething lying on the floorhe turned to squint at what hed fallen over and felt as though hisstomach had dissolvedjustin finchfletchley was lying on the floor rigid and cold a look ofshock frozen on his face his eyes staring blankly at the ceiling andthat wasnt all next to him was another figure the strangest sightharry had ever seenit was nearly headless nick no longer pearlywhite andtransparent but black and smoky floating immobile and horizontalsix inches off the floor his head was half off and his face wore anexpression of shock identical to justinsharry got to his feet his breathing fast and shallow his heart doing akind of drumroll against his ribs he looked wildly up and down thedeserted corridor and saw a line of spiders scuttling as fast as theycould away from the bodies the only sounds were the muffledvoices of teachers from the classes on either sidehe could run and no one would ever know he had been there buthe couldnt just leave them lying here he had to get help would anyone believe he hadnt had anything to do with thisas he stood there panicking a door right next to him opened with abang peeves the poltergeist came shooting outwhy its potty wee potter cackled peeves knocking harrysglasses askew as he bounced past him whats potter up to whyspotter lurking peeves stopped halfway through a midair somersault upside downhe spotted justin and nearly headless nick he flipped the rightway up filled his lungs and before harry could stop him screamedattack attack another attack no mortalor ghost is safe run for your livesattaaaackcrash crash crash door after door flew open along the corridorand people flooded out for several long minutes there was a sceneof such confusion that justin was in danger of being squashed andpeople kept standing in nearly headless nick harry found himselfpinned against the wall as the teachers shouted for quiet professormcgonagall came running followed by her own class one of whomstill had blackandwhitestriped hair she used her wand to set offaloud bang which restored silence and ordered everyone back intotheir classes no sooner had the scene cleared somewhat than erniethe hufflepuff arrived panting on the scenecaught in the act ernie yelled his face stark white pointing hisfinger dramatically at harrythat will do macmillan said professor mcgonagall sharplypeeves was bobbing overhead now grinning wickedly surveying thescene peeves always loved chaos as the teachers bent over justinand nearly headless nick examining them peeves broke into songoh potter you rotter oh what have you doneyoure killing off students you think its good fun thats enough peeves barked professor mcgonagall and peeveszoomed away backward with his tongue out at harryjustin was carried up to the hospital wing by professor flitwick andprofessor sinistra of the astronomy department but nobody seemedto know what to do for nearly headless nick in the end professormcgonagall conjured a large fan out of thin air which she gave toernie with instructions to waft nearly headless nick up the stairsthis ernie did fanning nick along like a silent black hovercraft thisleft harry and professor mcgonagall alone togetherthis way potter she saidprofessor said harry at once i swear i didnt this is out of my hands potter said professor mcgonagall curtlythey marched in silence around a corner and she stopped before alarge and extremely ugly stone gargoylelemon drop she said this was evidently a password because thegargoyle sprang suddenly to life and hopped aside as the wall behindhim split in two even full of dread for what was coming harrycouldnt fail to be amazed behind the wall was a spiral staircase thatwas moving smoothly upward like an escalator as he and professormcgonagall stepped onto it harry heard the wall thud closed behindthem they rose upward in circles higher and higher until at lastslightly dizzy harry saw a gleaming oak door ahead with a brassknocker in the shape of a griffinhe knew now where he was being taken this must be wheredumbledore livedc i a p t v rr t w e i vthe polyjuice potionhey stepped off the stone staircase at the top and professormcgonagall rapped on the door it opened silently and they enteredprofessor mcgonagall told harry to wait and left him there aloneharry looked around one thing was certain of all the teachersoffices harry had visited so far this year dumbledores was by farthe most interesting if he hadnt been scared out of his wits that hewas about to be thrown out of school he would have been verypleased to have a chance to look around itit was a large and beautiful circular room full of funny little noises anumber of curious silver instruments stood on spindlelegged tableswhirring and emitting little puffs of smoke the walls were coveredwith portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses all of whomwere snoozing gently in their frames there was also an enormousclawfooted desk and sitting on a shelf behind it a shabby tatteredwizards hat the sorting hatharry hesitated he cast a wary eye around the sleeping witches andwizards on the walls surely it couldnt hurt if he took the hat downand tried it on again just to see just to make sure it had put him inthe right househe walked quietly around the desk lifted the hat from its shelf andlowered it slowly onto his head it was much too large and slippeddown over his eyes just as it had done the last time hed put it onharry stared at the black inside of the hat waiting then a small voicesaid in his ear bee in your bonnet harry potterer yes harry muttered er sorry to bother you i wanted to ask youve been wondering whether i put you in the right house saidthe hat smartly yes you were particularly difficult to place but istand by what i said before harrys heart leapt you would havedone well in slytherin harrys stomach plummeted he grabbed the point of the hat andpulled it off it hung limply in his hand grubby and faded harrypushed it back onto its shelf feeling sickyoure wrong he said aloud to the still and silent hat it didnt moveharry backed away watching it then a strange gagging noise behindhim made him wheel aroundhe wasnt alone after all standing on a golden perch behind the doorwas a decrepitlooking bird that resembled a halfplucked turkeyharry stared at it and the bird looked balefully back making itsgagging noise again harry thought it looked very ill its eyes were dulland even as harry watched a couple more feathers fell out of its tailharry was just thinking that all he needed was for dumbledorespet bird to die while he was alone in the office with it when the birdburst into flamesharry yelled in shock and backed away into the desk he lookedfeverishly around in case there was a glass of water somewhere butcouldnt see one the bird meanwhile had become a fireball it gaveone loud shriek and next second there was nothing but a smoulderingpile of ash on the floorthe office door opened dumbledore came in looking very somberprofessor harry gasped your bird i couldnt do anything he justcaught fire to harrys astonishment dumbledore smiledabout time too he said hes been looking dreadful for days ivebeen telling him to get a move onhe chuckled at the stunned look on harrys facefawkes is a phoenix harry phoenixes burst into flame when it istime for them to die and are reborn from the ashes watch him harry looked down in time to see a tiny wrinkled newborn bird pokeits head out of the ashes it was quite as ugly as the old oneits a shame you had to see him on a burning day said dumbledoreseating himself behind his desk hes really very handsome most ofthe time wonderful red and gold plumage fascinating creaturesphoenixes they can carry immensely heavy loads their tears havehealing powers and they make highly faithful petsin the shock of fawkes catching fire harry had forgotten what hewas there for but it all came back to him as dumbledore settledhimself in the high chair behind the desk and fixed harry with hispenetrating lightblue starebefore dumbledore could speak another word however the door ofthe office flew open with an almighty bang and hagrid burst in a wildlook in his eyes his balaclava perched on top of his shaggy black headand the dead rooster still swinging from his handit wasn harry professor dumbledore said hagrid urgently i wastalkin ter him seconds before that kid was found he never had time sir dumbledore tried to say something but hagrid went ranting onwaving the rooster around in his agitation sending featherseverywhereit cantve bin him ill swear it in front o the ministry o magic if ihave to hagrid i yehve got the wrong boy sir i know harry never hagrid said dumbledore loudly i do not think that harryattacked those peopleoh said hagrid the rooster falling limply at his side right ill waitoutside then headmasterand he stomped out looking embarrassedyou dont think it was me professor harry repeated hopefully asdumbledore brushed rooster feathers off his deskno harry i dont said dumbledore though his face was somberagain but i still want to talk to youharry waited nervously while dumbledore considered him the tips ofhis long fingers togetheri must ask you harry whether there is anything youd like to tell mehe said gently anything at allharry didnt know what to say he thought of malfoy shouting youllbe next mudbloods and of the polyjuice potion simmering away inmoaning myrtles bathroom then he thought of the disembodiedvoice he had heard twice and remembered what ron had saidhearing voices no one else can hear isnt a good sign even in thewizarding world he thought too about what everyone was sayingabout him and his growing dread that he was somehow connectedwith salazar slytherin no said harry there isnt anything professor the double attack on justin and nearly headless nick turned whathad hitherto been nervousness into real panic curiously it was nearlyheadless nicks fate that seemed to worry people most what couldpossibly do that to a ghost people asked each other what terriblepower could harm someone who was already dead there wasalmost a stampede to book seats on the hogwarts express so thatstudents could go home for christmasat this rate well be the only ones left ron told harry andhermione us malfoy crabbe and goyle what a jolly holiday itsgoing to becrabbe and goyle who always did whatever malfoy did had signedup to stay over the holidays too but harry was glad that most peoplewere leaving he was tired of people skirting around him in thecorridors as though he was about to sprout fangs or spit poison tiredof all the muttering pointing and hissing as he passedfred and george however found all this very funny they went out oftheir way to march ahead of harry down the corridors shoutingmake way for the heir of slytherin seriously evil wizard comingthrough percy was deeply disapproving of this behaviorit is not a laughing matter he said coldlyoh get out of the way percy said fred harrys in a hurryyeah hes off to the chamber of secrets for a cup of tea with hisfanged servant said george chortlingginny didnt find it amusing eitheroh dont she wailed every time fred asked harry loudly who hewas planning to attack next or when george pretended to ward harryoff with a large clove of garlic when they metharry didnt mind it made him feel better that fred and george atleast thought the idea of his being slytherins heir was quite ludicrousbut their antics seemed to be aggravating draco malfoy who lookedincreasingly sour each time he saw them at itits because hes bursting to say its really him said ron knowinglyyou know how he hates anyone beating him at anything and youregetting all the credit for his dirty worknot for long said hermione in a satisfied tone the polyjuicepotions nearly ready well be getting the truth out of him any daynowat last the term ended and a silence deep as the snow on the groundsdescended on the castle harry found it peaceful rather than gloomyand enjoyed the fact that he hermione and the weasleys had the runof gryffindor tower which meant they couldplay exploding snap loudly without bothering anyone and practicedueling in private fred george and ginny had chosen to stay atschool rather than visit bill in egypt with mr and mrs weasleypercy who disapproved of what he termed their childish behaviordidnt spend much time in the gryffindor common room he hadalready told them pompously that he was only staying over christmasbecause it was his duty as a prefect to support the teachers duringthis troubled timechristmas morning dawned cold and white harry and ron the onlyones left in their dormitory were woken very early by hermionewho burst in fully dressed and carrying presents for them bothwake up she said loudly pulling back the curtains at the windowhermione youre not supposed to be in here said ron shieldinghis eyes against the lightmerry christmas to you too said hermione throwing him hispresent ive been up for nearly an hour adding more lacewings tothe potion its readyharry sat up suddenly wide awakeare you surepositive said hermione shifting scabbers the rat so that she couldsit down on the end of rons fourposter if were going to do it isay it should be tonightat that moment hedwig swooped into the room carrying a verysmall package in her beakhello said harry happily as she landed on his bed are youspeaking to me againshe nibbled his ear in an affectionate sort of way which was a farbetter present than the one that she had brought him which turnedout to be from the dursleys they had sent harry a toothpick and anote telling him to find out whether hed be able to stay at hogwartsfor the summer vacation toothe rest of harrys christmas presents were far more satisfactoryhagrid had sent him a large tin of treacle fudge which harry decidedto soften by the fire before eating ron had given him a book calledflying with the cannons a book of interesting facts about his favoritequidditch team and hermione had bought him a luxury eaglefeatherquill harry opened the last present to find a new handknittedsweater from mrs weasley and a large plum cake he read her cardwith a fresh surge of guilt thinking about mr weasleys car whichhadnt been seen since its crash with the whomping willow and thebout of rulebreaking he and ron were planning nextno one not even someone dreading taking polyjuice potion latercould fail to enjoy christmas dinner at hogwartsthe great hall looked magnificent not only were there a dozenfrostcovered christmas trees and thick streamers of holly andmistletoe crisscrossing the ceiling but enchanted snow was fallingwarm and dry from the ceiling dumbledore led them in a few of hisfavorite carols hagrid booming more and more loudly with everygoblet of eggnog he consumed percy who hadnt noticed that fredhad bewitched his prefect badge so that it now read pinhead keptasking them all what they were sniggering at harry didnt even carethat draco malfoy was making loud snide remarksl about his new sweater from the slytherin table with a bit of luckmalfoy would be getting his comeuppance in a few hours timeharry and ron had barely finished their third helpings of christmaspudding when hermione ushered them out of the hall to finalize theirplans for the eveningwe still need a bit of the people youre changing into saidhermione matteroffacdy as though she were sending them to thesupermarket for laundry detergent and obviously itll be best if youcan get something of crabbes and goyles theyre malfoys bestfriends hell tell them anything and we also need to make sure thereal crabbe and goyle cant burst in on us while were interrogatinghimive got it all worked out she went on smoothly ignoring harrysand rons stupefied faces she held up two plump chocolate cakesive filled these with a simple sleeping draught all you have to do ismake sure crabbe and goyle find them you know how greedy theyare theyre bound to eat them once theyre asleep pull out a few oftheir hairs and hide them in a broom closetharry and ron looked incredulously at each otherhermione i dont think that could go seriously wrong but hermione had a steely glint in her eye not unlike the oneprofessor mcgonagall sometimes hadthe potion will be useless without crabbes and goyles hair shesaid sternly you do want to investigate malfoy dont youoh all right all right said harry but what about you whose hairare you ripping outive already got mine said hermione brightly pulling a tiny bottleout of her pocket and showing them the single hair inside itremember millicent bulstrode wrestling with me at the duelingclub she left this on my robes when she was trying to strangle meand shes gone home for christmas so ill just have to tell theslytherins ive decided to come backwhen hermione had bustled off to check on the polyjuice potionagain ron turned to harry with a doomladen expressionhave you ever heard of a plan where so many things could gowrongbut to harrys and rons utter amazement stage one of theoperation went just as smoothly as hermione had said they lurkedin the deserted entrance hall after christmas tea waiting for crabbeand goyle who had remained alone at the slytherin table shovelingdown fourth helpings of trifle harry had perched the chocolatecakes on the end of the banisters when they spotted crabbe andgoyle coming out of the great hall harry and ron hid quicklybehind a suit of armor next to the front doorhow thick can you get ron whispered ecstatically as crabbegleefully pointed out the cakes to goyle and grabbed them grinningstupidly they stuffed the cakes whole into their large mouths for amoment both of them chewed greedily looks of triumph on theirfaces then without the smallest change of expression they bothkeeled over backward onto the floorby far the hardest part was hiding them in the closet across the hallonce they were safely stowed among the buckets and mops harryyanked out a couple of the bristles that covered goyles forehead and ron pulled out several of crabbes hairs they also stoletheir shoes because their own were far too small for crabbe andgoylesize feet then still stunned at what they had just done theysprinted up to moaning myrtles bathroomthey could hardly see for the thick black smoke issuing from the stallin which hermione was stirring the cauldron pulling their robes upover their faces harry and ron knocked softly on the doorhermionethey heard the scrape of the lock and hermione emerged shinyfacedand looking anxious behind her they heard the gloop gloopof the bubbling glutinous potion three glass tumblers stood ready onthe toilet seatdid you get them hermione asked breathlesslyharry showed her goyles hairgood and i sneaked these spare robes out of the laundry hermionesaid holding up a small sack youll need bigger sizes once yourecrabbe and goylethe three of them stared into the cauldron close up the potion lookedlike thick dark mud bubbling sluggishlyim sure ive done everything right said hermione nervouslyrereading the splotched page of moste potente potions it looks like thebook says it should once weve drunk it well have exactly an hourbefore we change back into ourselvesnow what ron whisperedwe separate it into three glasses and add the hairshermione ladled large dollops of the potion into each of the glassesthen her hand trembling she shook millicent bulstrodes hair out ofits bottle into the first glassthe potion hissed loudly like a boiling kettle and frothed madly asecond later it had turned a sick sort of yellowurgh essence of millicent bulstrode said ron eyeing it withloathing bet it tastes disgustingadd yours then said hermioneharry dropped goyles hair into the middle glass and ron put crabbesinto the last one both glasses hissed and frothed goyles turned thekhaki color of a booger crabbes a dark murky brownhang on said harry as ron and hermione reached for their glasseswed better not all drink them in here once we turn into crabbeand goyle we wont fit and millicent bulstrodes no pixiegood thinking said ron unlocking the door well take separatestallscareful not to spill a drop of his polyjuice potion harry slipped intothe middle stallready he calledready came rons and hermiones voicesone two three pinching his nose harry drank the potion down in two large gulps ittasted like overcooked cabbageimmediately his insides started writhing as though hed just swallowedlive snakes doubled up he wondered whether he was going to besick then a burning sensation spread rapidly from his stomach to thevery ends of his fingers and toes next bringing him gasping to allfours came a horrible melting feeling as the skin all over his bodybubbled like hot wax and before his eyes his hands began to growthe fingers thickened the nails broadenedthe knuckles were bulging like bolts his shoulders stretched painfullyand a prickling on his forehead told him that hair was creeping downtoward his eyebrows his robes ripped as his chest expanded like abarrel bursting its hoops his feet were agony in shoes four sizes toosmallas suddenly as it had started everything stopped harry lay facedownon the stonecold floor listening to myrtle gurgling morosely in the endtoilet with difficulty he kicked off his shoes and stood up so this waswhat it felt like being goyle his large hand trembling he pulled offhis old robes which were hanging a foot above his ankles pulled onthe spare ones and laced up goyles boatlike shoes he reached up tobrush his hair out of his eyes and met only the short growth of wirybristles low on his forehead then he realized that his glasses wereclouding his eyes because goyle obviously didnt need them he tookthem off and called are you two okay goyles low rasp of a voiceissued from his mouthyeah came the deep grunt of crabbe from his rightharry unlocked his door and stepped in front of the cracked mirrorgoyle stared back at him out of dull deepset eyes harry scratchedhis ear so did goylerons door opened they stared at each other except that he lookedpale and shocked ron was indistinguishable from crabbe from thepuddingbowl haircut to the long gorilla armsthis is unbelievable said ron approaching the mirror and proddingcrabbes flat nose unbelievable wed better get going said harry loosening the watch that wascutting into goyles thick wrist weve still got to find outwhere the slytherin common room is i only hope we can findsomeone to follow ron who had been gazing at harry said you dont know howbizarre it is to see goyle thinking he banged on hermiones doorcmon we need to go a highpitched voice

coast was clear and set offdont swing your arms like that harry muttered to ronehcrabbe holds them sort of stiff hows thisyeah thats better they went down the marble staircase all they needed now wasa slytherin that they could follow to the slytherin common room butthere was nobody aroundany ideas muttered harrythe slytherins always come up to breakfast from over there saidron nodding at the entrance to the dungeons the words had barelyleft his mouth when a girl with long curly hair emerged from theentranceexcuse me said ron hurrying up to her weve forgotten the wayto our common roomi beg your pardon said the girl stiffly our common room im aravenclawshe walked away looking suspiciously back at themharry and ron hurried down the stone steps into the darkness theirfootsteps echoing particularly loudly as crabbes and goyles hugefeet hit the floor feeling that this wasnt going to be as easy as theyhad hopedthe labyrinthine passages were deserted they walked deeper anddeeper under the school constantly checking their watches to seehow much time they had left after a quarter of an hour just whenthey were getting desperate they heard a sudden movement aheadha said ron excitedly theres one of them nowthe figure was emerging from a side room as they hurried nearerhowever their hearts sank it wasnt a slytherin it was percywhatre you doing down here said ron in surprisepercy

harryer said harryoh yeah pureblood said malfoy not listening and a stone doorconcealed in the wall slid open malfoy marched through it andharry and ron followed himthe slytherin common room was a long low underground roomwith rough stone walls and ceiling from which round greenish lampswere hanging on chains a fire was crackling under an elaboratelycarved mantelpiece ahead of them and several slytherins weresilhouetted around it in highbacked chairswait here said malfoy to harry and ron motioning them to a pairof empty chairs set back from the fire ill go and get it my fathersjust sent it to me wondering what malfoy was going to show them harry and ronsat down doing their best to look at homemalfoy came back a minute later holding what looked like anewspaper clipping he thrust it under rons nosethatll give you a laugh he saidharry saw rons eyes widen in shock he read the clipping quicklygave a very forced laugh and handed it to harryit had been clipped out of the daily prophet and it saidinquiry at the ministry of magicarthur weasley head of the misuse of muggle artifacts officewas today fined fifty galleons for bewitching a muggle carmr lucius malfoy a governor of hogwarts

hopingagainst hope that malfoy hadnt noticed anything harrycould feel his feet slipping around in goyles huge shoes and had tohoist up his robes as he shrank they crashed up the steps into the darkentrance hall which was full of a muffled pounding coming from thecloset where theyd locked crabbe and goyle leaving their shoesoutside the closet door they sprinted in their socks up the

the stairstoward gryffindor tower snape had given them so muchhomework harry thought he was likely to be in the sixth year beforehe finished it ron was just saying he wished he had asked hermionehow many rat tails you were supposed to add to a hairraisingpotion when an angry outburst from the floor above reached theirearsthats filch harry muttered as they hurried up the stairs andpaused out of sight listening hardyou dont think someone elses been attacked said ron tenselythey stood still their heads inclined toward flichs voice whichsounded quite hystericaleven more work for me mopping all night like i havent got enough todo no this is the final straw im going to dumbledore his footsteps receded along the outofsight corridor and they heard adistant door slamthey poked their heads around the corner filch had clearly beenmanning his usual lookout post they were once again on the spotwhere mrs norris had been attacked they saw at a glance whatfilch had been shouting about a great flood of water stretched overhalf the corridor and it looked as though it was still seeping fromunder the door of moaning myrtles bathroom now that filch hadstopped shouting they could hear myrtles wails echoing off thebathroom wallsnow whats up with her said ronlets go and see said harry and holding their robes over theirankles they stepped through the great wash of water to the doorbearing its out of order sign ignored it as always and enteredmoaning myrtle was crying if possible louder and harder than everbefore she seemed to be hiding down her usual toilet it was dark inthe bathroom because the candles had been extinguished in the greatrush of water that had left both walls and floor soaking wetwhats up myrtle said harrywhos that glugged myrtle miserably come to throw somethingelse at meharry waded across to her stall and said why would i throwsomething at youdont ask me myrtle shouted emerging with a wave of yet morewater which splashed onto the already sopping floor here i amminding my own business and someone thinks its funny to throw abook at me but it cant hurt you if someone throws something at you saidharry reasonably i mean itd just go right through you wouldntithe had said the wrong thing myrtle puffed herself up and shriekedlets all throw books at myrtle because she cant feel it ten pointsif you can get it through her stomach fifty points if it goes throughher head well ha ha ha what a lovely game i dont thinkwho threw it at you anyway asked harryi dont know i was just sitting in the ubend thinking aboutdeath and it fell right through the top of my head said myrtleglaring at them its over there it got washed out harry and ron looked under the sink where myrtle was pointing asmall thin book lay there it had a shabby black cover and was aswet as everything else in the bathroom harry stepped forward topick it up but ron suddenly flung out an arm to hold him backwhat said harryare you crazy said ron it could be dangerousdangeroussaid harry laughing come off it how could it bedangerousyoud be surprised said ron who was looking apprehensively atthe book some of the books the ministrys confiscated dads toldme there was one that burned your eyes out andeveryone who read sonnets of a sorcerer spoke in limericks for the restof their lives and some old witch in bath had a book that you couldnever stop reading you just had to wander around with your nose in ittrying to do everything onehanded and all right ive got the point said harrythe little book lay on the floor nondescript and soggywell we wont find out unless we look at it he said and he duckedaround ron and picked it up off the floorharry saw at once that it was a diary and the faded year on the covertold him it was fifty years old he opened it eagerly on the first pagehe could just make out the name t m riddle in smudged inkhang on said ron who had approached cautiously and was lookingover harrys shoulder i know that name t m riddle got anaward for special services to the school fifty years agohow on earth dyou know that said harry in amazementbecause filch made me polish his shield about fifty times indetention said ron resentfully that was the one i burped slugs allover if youd wiped slime off a name for an hour youd remember ittooharry peeled the wet pages apart they were completely blankthere wasnt the faintest trace of writing on any of them not evenauntie mabels birthday or dentist halfpast threehe never wrote in it said harry disappointedi wonder why someone wanted to flush it away said ron curiouslyharry turned to the back cover of the book and saw the printed nameof a variety store on vauxhall road londonhe mustve been muggleborn said harry thoughtfufly to havebought a diary from vauxhall road well its not much use to you said ron he dropped his voice fiftypoints if you can get it through myrtles noseharry however pocketed ithermione left the hospital wing dewhiskered tailless and furfree atthe beginning of february on her first evening back in gryffindortower harry showed her t m riddles diary and told her the storyof how they had found itoooh it might have hidden powers said hermione enthusiasticallytaking the diary and looking at it closelyif it has its hiding them very well said ron maybe its shy i dontknow why you dont chuck it harryi wish i knew why someone did try to chuck it said harry iwouldnt mind knowing how riddle got an award for special servicesto hogwarts eithercouldve been anything said ron maybe he got thirty owls orsaved a teacher from the giant squid maybe he murdered myrtle thatwouldve done everyone a favor but harry could tell from the arrested look on hermiones face thatshe was thinking what he was thinkingwhat said ron looking from one to the otherwell the chamber of secrets was opened fifty years ago wasnt ithe said thats what malfoy saidyeah said ron slowlyand this diary is fifty years old said hermione tapping it excitedlya sooh ron wake up snapped hermione we know the person whoopened the chamber last time was expelled fifty years ago we knowt m riddle got an award for special services to the school fifty yearsago well what if riddle got his special award for catching the heir ofslytherin his diary would probably tell us everything where thechamber is and how to open it and what sort of creature lives in it the person whos behind the attacks this time wouldnt want that lyingaround would theythats a brilliant theory hermione said ron with just one tiny littleflaw theres nothing written in his diarybut hermione was pulling her wand out of her bagit might be invisible ink she whisperedshe tapped the diary three times and said apareciumnothing happened undaunted hermione shoved her hand back intoher bag and pulled out what appeared to be a bright red eraserits a revealer i got it in diagon alley she saidshe rubbed hard on january first nothing happenedim telling you theres nothing to find in there said ron riddle justgot a diary for christmas and couldnt be bothered filling it inharry couldnt explain even to himself why he didnt just throwriddles diary away the fact was that even though he knew the diarywas blank he kept absentmindedly picking it up and turning the pagesas though it were a story he wanted to finish and while harry wassure he had never heard the name t m riddle before it still seemedto mean something to him almost as thoughriddle was a friend hed had when he was very small and hadhalfforgotten but this was absurd hed never had friends beforehogwarts dudley had made sure of thatnevertheless harry was determined to find out more about riddle sonext day at break he headed for the trophy room to examine riddlesspecial award accompanied by an interested hermione and athoroughly unconvinced ron who told them hed seen enough of thetrophy room to last him a lifetimeriddles burnished gold shield was tucked away in a corner cabinet itdidnt carry details of why it had been given to him good thing tooor itd be even bigger and id still be polishing it said ron howeverthey did find riddles name on an old medal for magical merit and ona list of old head boyshe sounds like percy said ron wrinkling his nose in disgustprefect head boy probably top of every class you say that like its a bad thing said hermione in a slightly hurtvoicethe sun had now begun to shine weakly on hogwarts again insidethe castle the mood had grown more hopeful there had been nomore attacks since those on justin and nearly headless nick andmadam pomfrey was pleased to report that the mandrakes werebecoming moody and secretive meaning that they were fast leavingchildhoodthe moment their acne clears up theyll be ready for repotting againharry heard her telling filch kindly one afternoon and after that itwont be long until were cutting them up and stewing them youllhave mrs norris back in no timeperhaps the heir of slytherin had lost his or her nerve thought harryit must be getting riskier and riskier to open the chamber of secretswith the school so alert and suspicious perhaps the monsterwhatever it was was even now settling itself down to hibernate foranother fifty years ernie macmillan of hufflepuff didnt take this cheerful view he wasstill convinced that harry was the guilty one that he had givenhimself away at the dueling club peeves wasnt helping matters hekept popping up in the crowded corridors singing oh potter yourotter now with a dance routine to matchgilderoy lockhart seemed to think he himself had made the attacksstop harry overheard him telling professor mcgonagall so while thegryffindors were lining up for transfigurationi dont think therell be any more trouble minerva he said tappinghis nose knowingly and winking i think the chamber has been lockedfor good this time the culprit must have known it was only a matterof time before i caught him rather sensible to stop now before icame down hard on himyou know what the school needs now is a moralebooster washaway the memories of last term i wont say any more just now but ithink i know just the thing he tapped his nose again and strode offlockharts idea of a moralebooster became clear at breakfast time onfebruary fourteenth harry hadnt had much sleep because of a laterunningquidditch practice the night before and he hurried down tothe great hall slightly late he thought for a moment that hedwalked through the wrong doorsthe walls were all covered with large lurid pink flowers worsestill heartshaped confetti was falling from the pale blue ceiling harrywent over to the gryffindor table where ron was sitting lookingsickened and hermione seemed to have been overcome with giggleswhats going on harry asked them sitting down and wiping confettioff his baconron pointed to the teachers table apparently too disgusted to speaklockhart wearing lurid pink robes to match the decorations waswaving for silence the teachers on either side of him were lookingstonyfaced from where he sat harry could see a muscle going inprofessor mcgonagalls cheek snape looked as though someone hadjust fed him a large beaker of skelegrohappy valentines day lockhart shouted and may i thank thefortysix people who have so far sent me cards yes i have taken theliberty of arranging this little surprise for you all and it doesnt endherelockhart clapped his hands and through the doors to the entrance hallmarched a dozen surlylooking dwarfs not just any dwarfs howeverlockhart had them all wearing golden wings and carrying harpsmy friendly cardcarrying cupids beamed lockhart they will beroving around the school today delivering your valentines and the fundoesnt stop here im sure my colleagues will want to enter into thespirit of the occasion why not ask professor snape to show you howto whip up a love potion and while youre at it professor flitwickknows more about entrancing enchantments than any wizard iveever met the sly old dogprofessor flitwick buried his face in his hands snape was looking as though the first person to ask him for a love potion would beforcefed poisonplease hermione tell me you werent one of the fortysix said ronas they left the great hall for their first lesson hermione suddenlybecame very interested in searching her bag for her schedule anddidnt answerall day long the dwarfs kept barging into their classes to delivervalentines to the annoyance of the teachers and late that afternoon asthe gryffindors were walking upstairs for charms one of the dwarfscaught up with harryoy you arty potter shouted a particularly grimlooking dwarfelbowing people out of the way to get to harryhot all over at the thought of being given a valentine in front of a lineof first years which happened to include ginny weasley harry triedto escape the dwarf however cut his way through the crowd bykicking peoples shins and reached him before hed gone two pacesive got a musical message to deliver to arry potter in person hesaid twanging his harp in a threatening sort of waynot here harry hissed trying to escapestay still grunted the dwarf grabbing hold of harrys bag and pullinghim backlet me go harry snarled tuggingwith a loud ripping noise his bag split in two his books wandparchment and quill spilled onto the floor and his ink bottle smashedover everythingharry scrambled around trying to pick it all up before the dwarfstarted singing causing something of a holdup in the corridorwhats going on here came the cold drawling voice of dracomalfoy harry started stuffing everything feverishly into his rippedbag desperate to get away before malfoy could hear his musicalvalentinewhats all this commotion said another familiar voice as percyweasley arrivedlosing his head harry tried to make a run for it but the dwarfseized him around the knees and brought him crashing to the floorright he said sitting on harrys ankles here is your singingvalentinehis eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toadhis hair is as dark as a blackboardi wish he was mine hes really divinethe hero who conquered the dark lordharry would have given all the gold in gringotts to evaporate on thespot trying valiantly to laugh along with everyone else he got up hisfeet numb from the weight of the dwarf as percy weasley did hisbest to disperse the crowd some of whom were crying with mirthoff you go off you go the bell rang five minutes ago off to classnow he said shooing some of the younger students away and youmalfoyharry glancing over saw malfoy stoop and snatch up somethingleering he showed it to crabbe and goyle and harry realized thathed got riddles diarygive that back said harry quietlywonder what potters written in this said malfoy who obviously hadnt noticed the year on the cover and thought he hadharrys own diary a hush fell over the onlookers ginny was staringfrom the diary to harry looking terrifiedhand it over malfoy said percy sternlywhen ive had a look said malfoy waving the diary tauntingly atharrypercy said as a school prefect but harry had lost his temper hepulled out his wand and shouted expelliarmus and just assnape had disarmed lockhart so malfoy found the diary shootingout of his hand into the air ron grinning broadly caught itharry said percy loudly no magic in the corridors ill have toreport this you knowbut harry didnt care he was oneup on malfoy and that was worthfive points from gryffindor any day malfoy was looking furious andas ginny passed him to enter her classroom he yelled spitefully afterher i dont think potter liked your valentine muchginny covered her face with her hands and ran into class snarlingron pulled out his wand too but harry pulled him away ron didntneed to spend the whole of charms belching slugsit wasnt until they had reached professor flitwicks class that harrynoticed something rather odd about riddles diary all his otherbooks were drenched in scarlet ink the diary however was asclean as it had been before the ink bottle had smashed all over it hetried to point this out to ron but ron was having trouble with hiswand again large purple bubbles were blossoming out of the endand he wasnt much interested in anything elseharry went to bed before anyone else in his dormitory that night thiswas partly because he didnt think he could stand fred and georgesinging his eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad one more timeand partly because he wanted to examine riddles diary again andknew that ron thought he was wasting his timeharry sat on his fourposter and flicked through the blank pages notone of which had a trace of scarlet ink on it then he pulled a newbottle out of his bedside cabinet dipped his quill into it and dropped ablot onto the first page of the diarythe ink shone brightly on the paper for a second and then as though itwas being sucked into the page vanished excited harry loaded uphis quill a second time and wrote my name is harry potterthe words shone momentarily on the page and they too sank withouttrace then at last something happenedoozing back out of the page in his very own ink came words harryhad never writtenhello harry potter my name is tom riddle how did you come by mydiarythese words too faded away but not before harry had started toscribble backsomeone tried to flush it down a toilethe waited eagerly for riddles replylucky that i recorded my memories in some more lasting way than inkbut i always knew that there would be those who would not want thisdiary read what do you mean harry scrawled blotting the page in hisexcitementi mean that this diary holds memories of terrible things things that werecovered up things that happened at hogwarts school of witchcraft andwizardry thats where i am now harry wrote quickly im at hogwarts andhorrible stuffs been happening do you know anything about thechamber of secretshis heart was hammering riddles reply came quickly his writingbecoming untidier as though he was hurrying to tell all he knewof course i know about the chamber of secrets in my day they told us itwas a legend that it did not exist but this was a lie in my fifth year thechamber was opened and the monster attacked several students finallykilling one i caught the person whod opened the chamber and he wasexpelled but the headmaster professor dippet ashamed that such a thinghad happened at hogwarts forbade me to tell the truth a story was givenout that thegirl had died in a freak accident they gave me a nice shinyengraved trophy for my trouble and warned me to keep my mouth shut but iknew it could happen again the monster lived on and the one who had thepower to release it was not imprisoned harry nearly upset his ink bottle in his hurry to write backits happening again now there have been three attacks and no oneseems to know whos behind them who was it last timei can show you if you like came riddles reply you dont haveto take my word for it i can take you inside my memory of the nightwhen i caught him harry hesitated his quill suspended over the diary what did riddlemean how could he be taken inside somebody elses memory heglanced nervously at the door to the dormitory which wasgrowing dark when he looked back at the diary he saw fresh wordsforminglet me show you harry paused for a fraction of a second and then wrote two letterskthe pages of the diary began to blow as though caught in a high windstopping halfway through the month of june mouth hanging openharry saw that the little square for june thirteenth seemed to haveturned into a miniscule television screen his hands trembling slightlyhe raised the book to press his eye against the little window andbefore he knew what was happening he was tilting forward thewindow was widening he felt his body leave his bed and he waspitched headfirst through the opening in the page into a whirl of colorand shadowhe felt his feet hit solid ground and stood shaking as the blurredshapes around him came suddenly into focushe knew immediately where he was this circular room with thesleeping portraits was dumbledores office but it wasnt dumbledorewho was sitting behind the desk a wizened fraillooking wizard baldexcept for a few wisps of white hair was reading a letter bycandlelight harry had never seen this man beforeim sorry he said shakily i didnt mean to butt in but the wizard didnt look up he continued to read frowning slightlyharry drew nearer to his desk and stammered er ill just go shallistill the wizard ignored him he didnt seem even to have heard himthinking that the wizard might be deaf harry raised his voicesorry i disturbed you ill go now he halfshoutedthe wizard folded up the letter with a sigh stood up walked pastharry without glancing at him and went to draw the curtains at hiswindowthe sky outside the window was rubyred it seemed to be sunsetthe wizard went back to the desk sat down and twiddled his thumbswatching the doorharry looked around the office no fawkes the phoenix no whirringsilver contraptions this was hogwarts as riddle had known itmeaning that this unknown wizard was headmaster not dumbledoreand he harry was little more than a phantom completely invisible tothe people of fifty years agothere was a knock on the office doorenter said the old wizard in a feeble voicea boy of about sixteen entered taking off his pointed hat a silverprefects badge was glinting on his chest he was much taller thanharry but he too had jetblack hairah riddle said the headmasteryou wanted to see me professor dippet said riddle he lookednervoussit down said dippet ive just been reading the letter you sent meoh said riddle he sat down gripping his hands together verytightlymy dear boy said dipper kindly i cannot possibly let you stay atschool over the summer surely you want to go home for theholidaysno said riddle at once id much rather stay at hogwarts than goback to that to that you live in a muggle orphanage during the holidays i believe saiddippet curiouslyyes sir said riddle reddening slightlyyou are mugglebornhalfblood sir said riddle muggle father witch motherand are both your parents my mother died just after i was born sir they told me at theorphanage she lived just long enough to name me tom after myfather marvolo after my grandfatherdipper clucked his tongue sympatheticallythe thing is tom he sighed special arrangements might havebeen made for you but in the current circumstances you mean all these attacks sir said riddle and harrys heartleapt and he moved closer scared of missing anythingprecisely said the headmaster my dear boy you must see howfoolish it would be of me to allow you to remain at the castle whenterm ends particularly in light of the recent tragedy the death ofthat poor little girl you will be safer by far at your orphanage asa matter of fact the ministry of magic is even now talking aboutclosing the school we are no nearer locating the er source of allthis unpleasantness riddles eyes had widenedsir if the person was caught if it all stopped what do you mean said dippet with a squeak in his voice sittingup in his chair riddle do you mean you know something aboutthese attacksno sir said riddle quicklybut harry was sure it was the same sort of no that he himself hadgiven dumbledoredippet sank back looking faintly disappointedyou may go tom riddle slid off his chair and slouched out of the room harryfollowed himdown the moving spiral staircase they went emerging next to thegargoyle in the darkening corridor riddle stopped and so didharry watching him harry could tell that riddle was doing someserious thinking he was biting his lip his forehead furrowedthen as though he had suddenly reached a decision he hurried offharry gliding noiselessly behind him they didnt see another personuntil they reached the entrance hall when a tall wizard with longsweeping auburn hair and a beard called to riddle from the marblestaircasewhat are you doing wandering around this late tomharry gaped at the wizard he was none other than a fiftyyearyoungerdumbledorei had to see the headmaster sir said riddlewell hurry off to bed said dumbledore giving riddle exactly thekind of penetrating stare harry knew so well best not to roam thecorridors these days not since he sighed heavily bade riddle good night and strode off riddlewatched him walk out of sight and then moving quickly headedstraight down the stone steps to the dungeons with harry in hotpursuitbut to harrys disappointment riddle led him not into a hiddenpassageway or a secret tunnel but to the very dungeon in whichharry had potions with snape the torches hadnt been lit and whenriddle pushed the door almost closed harry could only justsee him standing stockstill by the door watching the passage outsideit felt to harry that they were there for at least an hour all he couldsee was the figure of riddle at the door staring through the crackwaiting like a statue and just when harry had stopped feelingexpectant and tense and started wishing he could return to the presenthe heard something move beyond the doorsomeone was creeping along the passage he heard whoever it waspass the dungeon where he and riddle were hidden riddle quiet as ashadow edged through the door and followed harry tiptoeing behindhim forgetting that he couldnt be heardfor perhaps five minutes they followed the footsteps until riddlestopped suddenly his head inclined in the direction of new noisesharry heard a door creak open and then someone speaking in ahoarse whispercmon gotta get yeh outta here cmon now in the box there was something familiar about that voice riddle suddenly jumped around the corner harry stepped out behindhim he could see the dark outline of a huge boy who was crouchingin front of an open door a very large box next to itevening rubeus said riddle sharplythe boy slammed the door shut and stood upwhat yer doin down here tomriddle stepped closerits all over he said im going to have to turn you in rubeustheyre talking about closing hogwarts if the attacks dont stopn at dyeh i dont think you meant to kill anyone but monsters dont makegood pets i suppose you just let it out for exercise and it never killed no one said the large boy backing against theclosed door from behind him harry could hear a funny rustling andclickingcome on rubeus said riddle moving yet closer the dead girlsparents will be here tomorrow the least hogwarts can do is makesure that the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered it wasnt him roared the boy his voice echoing in the darkpassage he wouldn he neverstand aside said riddle drawing out his wandhis spell lit the corridor with a sudden flaming light the door behindthe large boy flew open with such force it knocked him into the wallopposite and out of it came something that made harry let out along piercing scream unheard by anyonea vast lowslung hairy body and a tangle of black legs a gleam ofmany eyes and a pair of razorsharp pincers riddle raised hiswand again but he was too late the thing bowled him over as itscuttled away tearing up the corridor and out of sight riddlescrambled to his feet looking after it he raised his wand but thehuge boy leapt on him seized his wand and threw him back downyelling nothe scene whirled the darkness became complete harry felt himselffalling and with a crash he landed spreadeagled on his fourposterin the gryffindor dormitory riddles diary lying open on his stomachbefore he had had time to regain his breath the dormitory dooropened and ron came inthere you are he saidharry sat up he was sweating and shakingwhats up said ron looking at him with concernit was hagrid ron hagrid opened the chamber of secrets fiftyyears agoharry ron and hermione had always known that hagrid had anunfortunate liking for large and monstrous creatures during their firstyear at hogwarts he had tried to raise a dragon in his little woodenhouse and it would be a long time before they forgot the giant threeheadeddog hed christened fluffy and if as a boy hagrid hadheard that a monster was hidden somewhere in the castle harry wassure hed have gone to any lengths for a glimpse of it hed probablythought it was a shame that the monster had been cooped up solong and thought it deserved the chance to stretch its many legsharry could just imagine the thirteenyearold hagrid trying to fit aleash and collar on it but he was equally certain that hagrid wouldnever have meant to kill anybodyharry half wished he hadnt found out how to work riddles diaryagain and again ron and hermione made him recount whathed seen until he was heartily sick of telling them and sick of thelong circular conversations that followedriddle might have got the wrong person said hermione maybe itwas some other monster that was attacking people how many monsters dyou think this place can hold ron askeddullywe always knew hagrid had been expelled said harry miserablyand the attacks mustve stopped after hagrid was kicked outotherwise riddle wouldnt have got his awardron tried a different tackriddle does sound like percy who asked him to squeal on hagridanywaybut the monster had killed someone ron said hermioneand riddle was going to go back to some muggle orphanage if theyclosed hogwarts said harry i dont blame him for wanting to stayhere you met hagrid down knockturn alley didnt you harryhe was buying a flesheating slug repellent said harry quicklythe three of them fell silent after a long pause hermione voiced theknottiest question of all in a hesitant voicedo you think we should go and ask hagrid about it allthatd be a cheerful visit said ron hello hagrid tell us haveyou been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle latelyin the end they decided that they would not say anything to hagridunless there was another attack and as more and more days went bywith no whisper from the disembodied voice they becamehopeful that they would never need to talk to him about why he hadbeen expelled it was now nearly four months since justin and nearlyheadless nick had been petrified and nearly everybody seemed tothink that the attacker whoever it was had retired for good peeveshad finally got bored of his oh potter you rotter song erniemacmillan asked harry quite politely to pass a bucket of leapingtoadstools in herbology one day and in march several of themandrakes threw a loud and raucous party in greenhouse three thismade professor sprout very happythe moment they start trying to move into each others pots wellknow theyre fully mature she told harry then well be able torevive those poor people in the hospital wingthe second years were given something new to think about duringtheir easter holidays the time had come to choose their subjects forthe third year a matter that hermione at least took very seriouslyit could affect our whole future she told harry and ron as theypored over lists of new subjects marking them with checksi just want to give up potions said harrywe cant said ron gloomily we keep all our old subjects or idveditched defense against the dark artsbut thats very important said hermione shockednot the way lockhart teaches it said ron i havent learnedanything from him except not to set pixies looseneville longbottom had been sent letters from all the witches andwizards in his family all giving him different advice on what tochoose confused and worried he sat reading the subject lists withhis tongue poking out asking people whether they thought arithmancysounded more difficult than the study of ancient runes deanthomas who like harry had grown up with muggles ended upclosing his eyes and jabbing his wand at the list then picking thesubjects it landed on hermione took nobodys advice but signed up foreverythingharry smiled grimly to himself at the thought of what uncle vernonand aunt petunia would say if he tried to discuss his career inwizardry with them not that he didnt get any guidance percyweasley was eager to share his experiencedepends where you want to go harry he said its never too earlyto think about the future so id recommend divination people saymuggle studies is a soft option but i personally think wizards shouldhave a thorough understanding of the nonmagical communityparticularly if theyre thinking of working in close contact with them look at my father he has to deal with muggle business all the time mybrother charlie was always more of an outdoor type so he went forcare of magical creatures play to your strengths harrybut the only thing harry felt he was really good at was quidditch inthe end he chose the same new subjects as ron feeling that if he waslousy at them at least hed have someone friendly to help himgryffindors next quidditch match would be against hufflepuff woodwas insisting on team practices every night after dinner so that harrybarely had time for anything but quidditch and homework howeverthe training sessions were getting better or at leastdrier and the evening before saturdays match he went up to hisdormitory to drop off his broomstick feeling gryffindors chances forthe quidditch cup had never been betterbut his cheerful mood didnt last long at the top of the stairs to thedormitory he met neville longbottom who was looking franticharry i dont know who did it i just found watching harry fearfully neville pushed open the doorthe contents of harrys trunk had been thrown everywhere hiscloak lay ripped on the floor the bedclothes had been pulled off hisfourposter and the drawer had been pulled out of his bedsidecabinet the contents strewn over the mattressharry walked over to the bed openmouthed treading on a fewloose pages of travels with trolls

into itthat he realized what wasnt thereriddles diarys gone he said in an undertone to ronwhatharry jerked his head toward the dormitory door and ron followedhim out they hurried down to the gryffindor commonroom which was halfempty and joined hermione who was sittingalone reading a book called ancient runes made easyhermione looked aghast at the newsbut only a gryffindor could have stolen nobody else knows ourpassword exactly said harrythey woke the next day to brilliant sunshine and a light refreshingbreezeperfect quidditch conditions said wood enthusiastically at thegryffindor table loading the teams plates with scrambled eggsharry buck up there you need a decent breakfastharry had been staring down the packed gryffindor table wonderingif the new owner of riddles diary was right in front of his eyeshermione had been urging him to report the robbery but harry didntlike the idea hed have to tell a teacher all about the diary and howmany people knew why hagrid had been expelled fifty years ago hedidnt want to be the one who brought it all up againas he left the great hall with ron and hermione to go and collect hisquidditch things another very serious worry was added to harrysgrowing list he had just set foot on the marble staircase when heheard it yet againkill this time let me rip tear he shouted aloud and ron and hermione both jumped away from himin alarmthe voice said harry looking over his shoulder i just heard itagain didnt youron shook his head wideeyed hermione however clapped ahand to her foreheadharry i think ive just understood something ive got to go to thelibraryand she sprinted away up the stairswhat does she understand said harry distractedly still lookingaround trying to tell where the voice had come fromloads more than i do said ron shaking his headbut whys she got to go to the librarybecause thats what hermione does said ron shrugging when indoubt go to the libraryharry stood irresolute trying to catch the voice again but peoplewere now emerging from the great hall behind him talking loudlyexiting through the front doors on their way to the quidditch pitchyoud better get moving said ron its nearly eleven the match harry raced up to gryffindor tower collected his nimbus twothousand and joined the large crowd swarming across the groundsbut his mind was still in the castle along with the bodiless voice andas he pulled on his scarlet robes in the locker room his only comfortwas that everyone was now outside to watch the gamethe teams walked onto the field to tumultuous applause oliverwood took off for a warmup flight around the goal posts madamhooch released the balls the hufflepuffs who played in canaryyellow were standing in a huddle having a lastminute discussion oftacticsharry was just mounting his broom when professor mcgonagallcame half marching half running across the pitch carrying anenormous purple megaphoneharrys heart dropped like a stonethis match has been cancelled professor mcgonagall calledthrough the megaphone addressing the packed stadium there wereboos and shouts oliver wood looking devastated landed and rantoward professor mcgonagall without getting off his broomstickbut professor he shouted weve got to play the cupgryffindor professor mcgonagall ignored him and continued to shout through hermegaphoneall students are to make their way back to the house commonrooms where their heads of houses will give them furtherinformation as quickly as you can pleasethen she lowered the megaphone and beckoned harry over to herpotter i think youd better come with me wondering how she could possibly suspect him this time harry sawron detach himself from the complaining crowd he came running upto them as they set off toward the castle to harrys surpriseprofessor mcgonagall didnt objectyes perhaps youd better come too weasley some of the students swarming around them were grumbling aboutthe match being canceled others looked worried harry and ronfollowed professor mcgonagall back into the school and up themarble staircase but they werent taken to anybodys office this timethis will be a bit of a shock said professor mcgonagall in asurprisingly gentle voice as they approached the infirmary there hasbeen another attack another double attackharrys insides did a horrible somersault professor mcgonagallpushed the door open and he and ron entered madam pomfrey was bending over a fifthyear girl with long curlyhair harry recognized her as the ravenclaw theyd accidentallyasked for directions to the slytherin common room and on the bednext to her washermione ron groanedhermione lay utterly still her eyes open and glassythey were found near the library said professor mcgonagall idont suppose either of you can explain this it was on the floor nextto them she was holding up a small circular mirrorharry and ron shook their heads both staring at hermionei will escort you back to gryffindor tower said professormcgonagall heavily i need to address the students in any caseall students will return to their house common rooms by six oclockin the evening no student is to leave the dormitories after that timeyou will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher no student is to usethe bathroom unaccompanied by a teacher all further quidditchtraining and matches are to be postponed there will be no moreevening activitiesthe gryffindors packed inside the common room listened to professormcgonagall in silence she rolled up the parchmentfrom which she had been reading and said in a somewhat chokedvoice i need hardly add that i have rarely been so distressed it islikely that the school will be closed unless the culprit behind theseattacks is caught i would urge anyone who thinks they might knowanything about them to come forwardshe climbed somewhat awkwardly out of the portrait hole and thegryffindors began talking immediatelythats two gryffindors down not counting a gryffindor ghost oneravenclaw and one hufflepuff said the weasley twins friend leejordan counting on his fingers havent any of the teachers noticedthat the slytherins are all safe isnt it obvious all this stuffs comingfrom slytherin the heir of slytherin the monster of slytherin whydont they just chuck all the slytherins out he roared to nods andscattered applausepercy weasley was sitting in a chair behind lee but for once he didntseem keen to make his views heard he was looking pale and stunnedpercys in shock george told harry quietly that ravenclaw girl penelope clearwater shes a prefect i dont think he thought themonster would dare attack a prefectbut harry was only halflistening he didnt seem to be able to get ridof the picture of hermione lying on the hospital bed as though carvedout of stone and if the culprit wasnt caught soon he was looking at alifetime back with the dursleys tom riddle had turned hagrid inbecause he was faced with the prospect of a muggle orphanage if theschool closed harry now knew exactly how he had feltwhatre we going to do said ron quietly in harrys ear dyouthink they suspect hagridweve got to go and talk to him said harry making up hismind i cant believe its him this time but if he set the monsterloose last time hell know how to get inside the chamber of secretsand thats a startbut mcgonagall said weve got to stay in our tower unless werein class i think said harry more quietly still its time to get my dadsold cloak out againharry had inherited ust one thing from his father a long and silvery invisibility cloak it was their only chance of sneaking out ofthe school to visit hagrid without anyone knowing about it theywent to bed at the usual time waited until neville dean and seamus had stopped discussing the chamber of secrets and finallyfallen asleep then got up dressed again and threw the cloak overthemselvesthe journey through the dark and deserted castle corridorswasnt enjoyable harry who had wandered the castle at night several times before had never seen it so crowded after sunset teachers prefects and ghosts were marching the corridors in pairsstaring around for any unusual activity their invisibility cloakdidnt stop them making any noise and there was a particularlytense moment when ron stubbed his toe only yards from the spotwhere snape stood standing guard thankfully snape sneezed atalmost exactly the moment ron swore it was with relief that theyreached the oak front doors and eased them openit was a clear starry night they hurried toward the lit windowsof hagrids house and pulled off the cloak only when they wereright outside his front doorseconds after they had knocked hagrid flung it open they foundthemselves facetoface with him aiming a crossbow at them fangthe boarhound barked loudly behind himoh he said lowering the weapon and staring at them whatreyou two doin herewhats that for said harry pointing at the crossbow as theystepped insidenothin nothin hagrid muttered ive bin expectin doesnmatter sit down ill make tea he hardly seemed to know what he was doing he nearlyextinguished the fire spilling water from the kettle on it and thensmashed the teapot with a nervous jerk of his massive handare you okay hagrid said harry did you hear abouthermioneoh i heard all righ said hagrid a slight break in his voicehe kept glancing nervously at the windows he poured them bothlarge mugs of boiling water he had forgotten to add tea bags andwas just putting a slab of fruitcake on a plate when there was a loudknock on the doorhagrid dropped the fruitcake harry and ron exchangedpanicstricken looks then threw the invisibility cloak back overthemselves and retreated into a corner hagrid checked that theywere hidden seized his crossbow and flung open his door oncemoregood evening hagridit was dumbledore he entered looking deadly serious and wasfollowed by a second very oddlooking manthe stranger had rumpled gray hair and an anxious expression andwas wearing a strange mixture of clothes a pinstriped suit

audible gaspmr lucius malfoy strode into hagrids hut swathed in a long blacktraveling cloak smiling a cold and satisfied smile fang started togrowlalready here fudge he said approvingly good good whatre you doin here said hagrid furiously get outta my housemy dear man please believe me i have no pleasure at all in beinginside your er dyou call this a house said lucius malfoy sneeringas he looked around the small cabin i simply called at the school andwas told that the headmaster was hereand what exactly did you want with me lucius said dumbledorehe spoke politely but the fire was still blazing in his blue eyesdreadful thing dumbledore said malfoy lazily taking out a long rollof parchment but the governors feel its time for you to step asidethis is an order of suspension youll find

many did yeh have ter threaten an blackmail before theyagreed malfoy eh he roareddear dear you know that temper of yours will lead you into troubleone of these days hagrid said mr malfoy i would

stuttered fudgenogrowled hagriddumbledore had not taken his bright blue eyes off lucius malfoyscold gray oneshowever said dumbledore speaking very slowly and clearly so thatnone of them could miss a word you will find that i willummer was creeping over the grounds around the castle sky and lakealike turned periwinkle blue and flowers large as cabbages burst intobloom in the greenhouses but with no hagrid visible from the castlewindows striding the grounds with fang at his heels the scene didntlook right to harry no better in fact than the inside of the castlewhere things were so horribly wrongharry and ron had tried to visit hermione but visitors were nowbarred from the hospital wingwere taking no more chances madam pomfrey told them severelythrough a crack in the infirmary door no im sorry theres everychance the attacker might come back to finish these people off with dumbledore gone fear had spread as never before so that thesun warming the castle walls outside seemed to stop at the mullionedwindows there was barely a face to be seen in the schoolthat didnt look worried and tense and any laughter that rang throughthe corridors sounded shrill and unnatural and was quickly stifledharry constantly repeated dumbledores final words to himself i willonly truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me help willalways be given at hogwarts to those who ask for it but what goodwere these words who exactly were they supposed to ask for helpwhen everyone was just as confused and scared as they werehagrids hint about the spiders was far easier to understand thetrouble was there didnt seem to be a single spider left in the castle tofollow harry looked everywhere he went helped rather reluctantlyby ron they were hampered of course by the fact that they werentallowed to wander off on their own but had to move around the castlein a pack with the other gryffindors most of their fellow studentsseemed glad that they were being shepherded from class to class byteachers but harry found it very irksomeone person however seemed to be thoroughly enjoying theatmosphere of terror and suspicion draco malfoy was struttingaround the school as though he had just been appointed head boyharry didnt realize what he was so pleased about until the potionslesson about two weeks after dumbledore and hagrid had left whensitting right behind malfoy harry overheard him gloating to crabbeand goylei always thought father might be the one who got rid ofdumbledore he said not troubling to keep his voice down i told youhe thinks dumbledores the worst headmaster the schools everhad maybe well get a decent headmaster now someone who wontwant the chamber of secrets closed mcgonagall wont last longshes only filling in snape swept past harry making no comment about hermionesempty seat and cauldronsir said malfoy loudly sir why dont you apply for theheadmasters jobnow now malfoy said snape though he couldnt suppress a thinlippedsmile professor dumbledore has only been suspended by thegovernors i daresay hell be back with us soon enoughyeah right said malfoy smirking i expect youd have fathersvote sir if you wanted to apply for the job ill tell father youre thebest teacher here sir snape smirked as he swept off around the dungeon fortunately notspotting seamus finnigan who was pretending to vomit into hiscauldronim quite surprised the mudbloods havent all packed their bags bynow malfoy went on bet you five galleons the next one dies pityit wasnt granger the bell rang at that moment which was lucky at malfoys lastwords ron had leapt off his stool and in the scramble to collect bagsand books his attempts to reach malfoy went unnoticedlet me at him ron growled as harry and dean hung onto his armsi dont care i dont need my wand im going to kill him with my barehands hurry up ive got to take you all to herbology barked snape overthe classs heads and off they marched with harry ron and deanbringing up the rear ron still trying to get loose it was onlysafe to let go of him when snape had seen them out of the castle andthey were making their way across the vegetable patch toward thegreenhousesthe herbology class was very subdued there were now two missingfrom their number justin and hermioneprofessor sprout set them all to work pruning the abyssinianshrivelfigs harry went to tip an armful of withered stalks onto thecompost heap and found himself facetoface with ernie macmillanernie took a deep breath and said very formally i just want to sayharry that im sorry i ever suspected you i know youd never attackhermione granger and i apologize for all the stuff i said were all inthe same boat now and well he held out a pudgy hand and harry shook iternie and his friend hannah came to work at the same shrivelfig asharry and ronthat draco malfoy character said ernie breaking off dead twigshe seems very pleased about all this doesnt he dyou know i thinkhe might be slytherins heirthats clever of you said ron who didnt seem to have forgivenernie as readily as harrydo you think its malfoy harry ernie askedno said harry so firmly that ernie and hannah stareda second later harry spotted somethingseveral large spiders were scuttling over the ground on the other sideof the glass moving in an unnaturally straight line as though taking theshortest route to a prearranged meeting harry hit ron over the handwith his pruning shearsouch whatre you harry pointed out the spiders following their progress with his eyesscrewed up against the sunoh yeah said ron trying and failing to look pleased but we cantfollow them now ernie and hannah were listening curiouslyharrys eyes narrowed as he focused on the spiders if they pursuedtheir fixed course there could be no doubt about where they wouldend uplooks like theyre heading for the forbidden forest and ron looked even unhappier about thatat the end of the lesson professor sprout escorted the class to theirdefense against the dark arts lesson harry and ron lagged behindthe others so they could talk out of earshotwell have to use the invisibility cloak again harry told ron wecan take fang with us hes used to going into the forest with hagridhe might be some helpright said ron who was twirling his wand nervously in his fingerser arent there arent there supposed to be werewolves in theforest he added as they took their usual places at the back oflockharts classroompreferring not to answer that question harry said there are goodthings in there too the centaurs are all right and the unicorns ron had never been into the forbidden forest before harry hadentered it only once and had hoped never to do so againlockhart bounded into the room and the class stared at him everyother teacher in the place was looking grimmer than usual butlockhart appeared nothing short of buoyantcome now he cried beaming around him why all these longfacespeople swapped exasperated looks but nobody answereddont you people realize said lockhart speaking slowly as thoughthey were all a bit dim the danger has passed the culprit has beentaken away says who said dean thomas loudlymy dear young man the minister of magic wouldnt have takenhagrid if he hadnt been one hundred percent sure that he was guiltysaid lockhart in the tone of someone explaining that one and onemade twooh yes he would said ron even more loudly than deani flatter myself i know a touch more about hagrids arrest than youdo mr weasley said lockhart in a selfsatisfied toneron started to say that he didnt think so somehow but stopped inmidsentence when harry kicked him hard under the deskwe werent there remember harry mutteredbut lockharts disgusting cheeriness his hints that he had alwaysthought hagrid was no good his confidence that the whole businesswas now at an end irritated harry so much that he yearned to throwgadding with ghouls right in lockharts stupid face instead hecontented himself with scrawling a note to ron lets do it tonightron read the message swallowed hard and looked sideways at theempty seat usually filled by hermione the sight seemed to stiffen hisresolve and he noddedthe gryffindor common room was always very crowded these daysbecause from six oclock onward the gryffindors had no where else to go they also had plenty to talk about with the resultthat the common room often didnt empty until past midnightharry went to get the invisibility cloak out of his trunk right afterdinner and spent the evening sitting on it waiting for the room toclear fred and george challenged harry and ron to a few games ofexploding snap and ginny sat watching them very subdued inhermiones usual chair harry and ron kept losing on purpose tryingto finish the games quickly but even so it was well past midnightwhen fred george and ginny finally went to bedharry and ron waited for the distant sounds of two dormitory doorsclosing before seizing the cloak throwing it over themselves andclimbing through the portrait holeit was another difficult journey through the castle dodging all theteachers at last they reached the entrance hall slid back the lock onthe oak front doors squeezed between them trying to stop anycreaking and stepped out into the moonlit groundscourse said ron abruptly as they strode across the black grasswe might get to the forest and find theres nothing to follow thosespiders might notve been going there at all i know it looked like theywere moving in that sort of general direction but his voice trailed away hopefullythey reached hagrids house sad and sorrylooking with its blankwindows when harry pushed the door open fang went mad with joyat the sight of them worried he might wake everyone at the castlewith his deep booming barks they hastily fed him treacle fudge froma tin on the mantelpiece which glued his teeth togetherharry left the invisibility cloak on hagrids table there would be noneed for it in the pitchdark forestl cmon fang were going for a walk said harry patting his leg andfang bounded happily out of the house behind them dashed to theedge of the forest and lifted his leg against a large sycamore treeharry took out his wand murmured lumos and a tiny lightappeared at the end of it just enough to let them watch the path forsigns of spidersgood thinking said ron id light mine too but you know itdprobably blow up or something harry tapped ron on the shoulder pointing at the grass two solitaryspiders were hurrying away from the wandlight into the shade of thetreesokay ron sighed as though resigned to the worst im ready letsgoso with fang scampering around them sniffing tree roots and leavesthey entered the forest by the glow of harrys wand they followedthe steady trickle of spiders moving along the path they walkedbehind them for about twenty minutes not speaking listening hard fornoises other than breaking twigs and rustling leaves then when thetrees had become thicker than ever so that the stars overhead wereno longer visible and harrys wand shone alone in the sea of darkthey saw their spider guides leaving the pathharry paused trying to see where the spiders were going buteverything outside his little sphere of light was pitchblack he hadnever been this deep into the forest before he could vividlyremember hagrid advising him not to leave the forest path last timehed been in here but hagrid was miles away now probably sitting ina cell in azkaban and he had also said to follow the spidersv something wet touched harrys hand and he jumped backwardcrushing rods foot but it was only fangs nosewhat dyou reckon harry said to ron whose eyes he could justmake out reflecting the light from his wandweve come this far said ronso they followed the darting shadows of the spiders into the treesthey couldnt move very quickly now there were tree roots andstumps in their way barely visible in the near blackness harry couldfeel fangs hot breath on his hand more than once they had to stopso that harry could crouch down and find the spiders in the wandlightthey walked for what seemed like at least half an hour their robessnagging on lowslung branches and brambles after a while theynoticed that the ground seemed to be sloping downward though thetrees were as thick as everthen fang suddenly let loose a great echoing bark making both harryand ron jump out of their skinswhat said ron loudly looking around into the pitchdark andgripping harrys elbow very hardtheres something moving over there harry breathed listen sounds like something big they listened some distance to their right the something big wassnapping branches as it carved a path through the treesoh no said ron oh no oh no oh shut up said harry frantically itll hear youhear me said ron in an unnaturally high voice its already heardfangthe darkness seemed to be pressing on their eyeballs as theystood terrified waiting there was a strange rumbling noise and thensilencewhat dyou think its doing said harryprobably getting ready to pounce said ronthey waited shivering hardly daring to movedyou think its gone harry whispereddunno then to their right came a sudden blaze of light so bright in thedarkness that both of them flung up their hands to shield their eyesfang yelped and tried to run but got lodged in a tangle of thorns andyelped even louderharry ron shouted his voice breaking with relief harry its ourcarwhatcome onharry blundered after ron toward the light stumbling and trippingand a moment later they had emerged into a clearingmr weasleys car was standing empty in the middle of a circle ofthick trees under a roof of dense branches its headlights ablaze asron walked openmouthed toward it it moved slowly toward himexactly like a large turquoise dog greeting its ownerits been here all the time said ron delightedly walking around thecar look at it the forests turned it wild the sides of the car were scratched and smeared with mudapparently it had taken to trundling around the forest on its ownfang didnt seem at all keen on it he kept close to harry who couldfeel him quivering his breathing slowing down again harry stuffedhis wand back into his robesand we thought it was going to attack us said ron leaning againstthe car and patting it i wondered where it had goneharry squinted around on the floodlit ground for signs of more spidersbut they had all scuttled away from the glare of the headlightsweve lost the trail he said cmon lets go and find themron didnt speak he didnt move his eyes were fixed on a pointsome ten feet above the forest floor right behind harry his face waslivid with terrorharry didnt even have time to turn around there was a loud clickingnoise and suddenly he felt something long and hairy seize him aroundthe middle and lift him off the ground so that he was hangingfacedown struggling terrified he heard more clicking and saw ronslegs leave the ground too heard fang whimpering and howling nextmoment he was being swept away into the dark treeshead hanging harry saw that what had hold of him was marching onsix immensely long hairy legs the front two clutching him tightly belowa pair of shining black pincers behind him he could hear another ofthe creatures no doubt carrying ron they were moving into the veryheart of the forest harry could hear fang fighting to free himself froma third monster whining loudly but harry couldnt have yelled even ifhe had wanted to he seemed to have left his voice back with the carin the clearinghe never knew how long he was in the creatures clutches he onlyknew that the darkness suddenly lifted enough for him to see that theleafstrewn ground was now swarming with spiders craning his necksideways he realized that they had reached the ridge ofa vast hollow a hollow that had been cleared of trees so that the starsshone brightly onto the worst scene he had ever laid eyes onspiders not tiny spiders like those surging over the leaves belowspiders the size of carthorses eighteyed eightlegged black hairygigantic the massive specimen that was carrying harry made its waydown the steep slope toward a misty domed web in the very center ofthe hollow while its fellows closed in all around it clicking theirpincers excitedly at the sight of its loadharry fell to the ground on all fours as the spider released him ronand fang thudded down next to him fang wasnt howling anymorebut cowering silently on the spot ron looked exactly like harry felthis mouth was stretched wide in a kind of silent scream and his eyeswere poppingharry suddenly realized that the spider that had dropped him wassaying something it had been hard to tell because he clicked hispincers with every word he spokearagog it called aragogand from the middle of the misty domed web a spider the size of asmall elephant emerged very slowly there was gray in the black ofhis body and legs and each of the eyes on his ugly pincered head wasmilky white he was blindwhat is it he said clicking his pincers rapidlymen clicked the spider who had caught harryis it hagrid said aragog moving closer his eight milky eyeswandering vaguelystrangers clicked the spider who had brought ronkill them clicked aragog fretfully i was sleeping were friends of hagrids harry shouted his heart seemed to haveleft his chest to pound in his throatclick click click went the pincers of the spiders all around the hollowaragog pausedhagrid has never sent men into our hollow before he said slowlyhagrids in trouble said harry breathing very fast thats whyweve comein trouble said the aged spider and harry thought he heard concernbeneath the clicking pincers but why has he sent youharry thought of getting to his feet but decided against it he didntthink his legs would support him so he spoke from the ground ascalmly as he couldthey think up at the school that hagrids been setting a a something on students theyve taken him to azkabanaragog clicked his pincers furiously and all around the hollow thesound was echoed by the crowd of spiders it was like applauseexcept applause didnt usually make harry feel sick with fearbut that was years ago said aragog fretfully years and years agoi remember it well thats why they made him leave the school theybelieved that i was the monster that dwells in what they call thechamber of secrets they thought that hagrid had opened thechamber and set me freeand you you didnt come from the chamber of secrets saidharry who could feel cold sweat on his foreheadi said aragog clicking angrily i was not born in the castle i comefrom a distant land a traveler gave me to hagrid when i was an egghagrid was only a boy but he cared for me hidden in a cupboard inthe castle feeding me on scraps from the table hagridyis my good friend and a good man when i was discovered andblamed for the death of a girl he protected me i have lived here inthe forest ever since where hagrid still visits me he even found mea wife mosag and you see how our family has grown all throughhagrids goodness harry summoned what remained of his courageso you never never attacked anyonenever croaked the old spider it would have been my instinct butout of respect for hagrid i never harmed a human the body of thegirl who was killed was discovered in a bathroom i never saw anypart of the castle but the cupboard in which i grew up our kind likethe dark and the quiet but then do you know what did kill that girl said harrybecause whatever it is its back and attacking people again his words were drowned by a loud outbreak of clicking and therustling of many long legs shifting angrily large black shapes shiftedall around himthe thing that lives in the castle said aragog is an ancient creaturewe spiders fear above all others well do i remember how i pleadedwith hagrid to let me go when i sensed the beast moving about theschoolwhat is it said harry urgentlymore loud clicking more rustling the spiders seemed to be closing inwe do not speak of it said aragog fiercely we do not name it inever even told hagrid the name of that dread creature though heasked me many timesharry didnt want to press the subject not with the spidersv pressing closer on all sides aragog seemed to be tired of tamng hewas backing slowly into his domed web but his fellow spiderscontinued to inch slowly toward harry and ronwell just go then harry called desperately to aragog hearingleaves rustling behind himgo said aragog slowly i think not but but my sons and daughters do not harm hagrid on my command but icannot deny them fresh meat when it wanders so willingly into ourmidst goodbye friend of hagridharry spun around feet away towering above him was a solid wallof spiders clicking their many eyes gleaming in their ugly black headseven as he reached for his wand harry knew it was no good therewere too many of them but as he tried to stand ready to die fightinga loud long note sounded and a blaze of light flamed through thehollowmr weasleys car was thundering down the slope headlights glaringits horn screeching knocking spiders aside several were thrown ontotheir backs their endless legs waving in the air the car screeched toa halt in front of harry and ron and the doors flew openget fang harry yelled diving into the front seat ron seized theboarhound around the middle and threw him yelping into the back ofthe car the doors slammed shut ron didnt touch the acceleratorbut the car didnt need him the engine roared and they were offhitting more spiders they sped up the slope out of the hollow andthey were soon crashing through the forest brancheswhipping the windows as the car wound its way cleverly through thewidest gaps following a path it obviously knewharry looked sideways at ron his mouth was still open in the silentscream but his eyes werent popping anymoreare you okayron stared straight ahead unable to speakthey smashed their way through the undergrowth fang howling loudlyin the back seat and harry saw the side mirror snap off as theysqueezed past a large oak after ten noisy rocky minutes the treesthinned and harry could again see patches of skythe car stopped so suddenly that they were nearly thrown into thewindshield they had reached the edge of the forest fang flunghimself at the window in his anxiety to get out and when harryopened the door he shot off through the trees to hagrids house tailbetween his legs harry got out too and after a minute or so ronseemed to regain the feeling in his limbs and followed still stiffneckedand staring harry gave the car a grateful pat as it reversed back intothe forest and disappeared from viewharry went back into hagrids cabin to get the invisibility cloak fangwas trembling under a blanket in his basket when harry got outsideagain he found ron being violently sick in the pumpkin patchfollow the spiders said ron weakly wiping his mouth on his sleeveill never forgive hagrid were lucky to be alivei bet he thought aragog wouldnt hurt friends of his said harrythats exactly hagrids problem said ron thumping the wall of thecabin he always thinks monsters arent as bad as theyremade out and look where its got him a cell in azkaban he wasshivering uncontrollably now what was the point of sending us inthere what have we found out id like to knowthat hagrid never opened the chamber of secrets said harrythrowing the cloak over ron and prodding him in the arm to make himwalk he was innocentron gave a loud snort evidently hatching aragog in a cupboardwasnt his idea of being innocentas the castle loomed nearer harry twitched the cloak to make suretheir feet were hidden then pushed the creaking front doors ajarthey walked carefully back across the entrance hall and up themarble staircase holding their breath as they passed corridors wherewatchful sentries were walking at last they reached the safety of thegryffindor common room where the fire had burned itself intoglowing ash they took off the cloak and climbed the winding stair totheir dormitoryron fell onto his bed without bothering to get undressed harryhowever didnt feel very sleepy he sat on the edge of his fourposterthinking hard about everything aragog had saidthe creature that was lurking somewhere in the castle he thoughtsounded like a sort of monster voldemort even other monsters didntwant to name it but he and ron were no closer to finding out what itwas or how it petrified its victims even hagrid had never knownwhat was in the chamber of secretsharry swung his legs up onto his bed and leaned back against hispillows watching the moon glinting at him through the tower windowhe couldnt see what else they could do they had hit dead endseverywhere riddle had caught the wrong person the heir ofslytherin had got off and no one could tell whether it was the sameperson or a different one who had opened the chamber this timethere was nobody else to ask harry lay down still thinking aboutwhat aragog had saidhe was becoming drowsy when what seemed like their very lasthope occurred to him and he suddenly sat bolt uprightron he hissed through the dark ron ron woke with a yelp like fangs stared wildly around and sawharryron that girl who died aragog said she was found in a bathroomsaid harry ignoring nevilles snufing snores from the corner whatif she never left the bathroom what if shes still thereron rubbed his eyes frowning through the moonlight and then heunderstood tooyou dont think not moaning myrtlea ll those times we were in that bathroom and she was justthree toilets away said ron bitterly at breakfast next dayand we couldve asked her and now it had been hard enough trying to look for spiders escaping theirteachers long enough to sneak into a girls bathroom the girls bathroommoreover right next to the scene of the first attack was going to bealmost impossiblebut something happened in their first lesson transfiguration that drovethe chamber of secrets out of their minds for the first time in weeksten minutes into the class professor mcgonagall told them that theirexams would start on the first of june one week from todayexams howled seamus finnigan were

mcgonagall scowleven more darklyprofessor dumbledores instructions were to keep the school runningas normally as possible she said and that i need hardly point outmeans finding out how much you have

at theslytherin table and wasnt at all surprised to see that draco malfoyhadnt joined in ron however was looking happier than hed looked indaysit wont matter that we never asked myrtle then he said to harryhermionell probably have all the answers when they wake her upmind you shell go crazy when she finds out weve got exams in threedays time she hasnt studied it might be kinder to leave her whereshe is till theyre overjust then ginny weasley came over and sat down next to ron shelooked tense and nervous and harry noticed that her hands weretwisting in her lapwhats up said ron helping himself to more porridgeginny didnt say anything but glanced up and down the gryffindortable with a scared look on her face that reminded harry of someonethough he couldnt think whospit it out said ron watching herharry suddenly realized who ginny looked like she was rockingbackward and forward slightly in her chair exactly like dobby didwhen he was teetering on the edge of revealing forbidden

deep breath and at that precise moment percy weasleyappeared looking tired and wanif youve finished eating ill take that seat ginny im starving iveonly just come off patrol dutyginny jumped up as though her chair had just been electrified gavepercy a fleeting frightened look and scampered away percy satdown and grabbed a mug from the center of the tablepercy said ron angrily she was just about

withouttheir help but he wasnt about to pass up a chance to speak to myrtleif it turned up and to his delight it did midmorning when they werebeing led to history of magic by gilderoy lockhartlockhart who had so often assured them that all danger had passedonly to be proved wrong right away was now wholeheartedlyconvinced that it was hardly worth the trouble to see them safelydown the corridors his hair wasnt as sleek as usual it seemed hehad been up most of the night patrolling the fourth floormark my words he said ushering them around a corner the firstwords out of those poor petrified peoples mouths will be it washagrid frankly im astounded professor mcgonagall thinks allthese security measures are necessaryti agree sir said harry making ron drop his books in surprisethank you harry said lockhart graciously while they waited for along line of hufflepuffs to pass i mean we teachers have quiteenough to be getting on with without walking students to classes andstanding guard all night thats right said ron catching on why dont you leave us here sirweve only got one more corridor to go you know weasley i think i will said lockhart i really should goand prepare my next class and he hurried offprepare his class ron sneered after him gone to curl his hairmore likethey let the rest of the gryffindors draw ahead of them then darteddown a side passage and hurried off toward moaning myrtlesbathroom but just as they were congratulating each other on theirbrilliant schemepotter weasley what are you doingit was professor mcgonagall and her mouth was the thinnest of thinlineswe were we were ron stammered we were going to to go andsee hermione said harry ron and professor mcgonagall both lookedat himwe havent seen her for ages professor harry went on hurriedlytreading on rons foot and we thought wed sneak into the hospitalwing you know and tell her the mandrakes are nearly ready and ernot to worry professor mcgonagall was still staring at him and for a momentharry thought she was going to explode but when she spoke it was ina strangely croaky voiceof course she said and harry amazed saw a tear glistening in herbeady eye of course i realize this has all been hardest on the friendsof those who have been i quite understand yespotter of course you may visit miss granger i will inform professorbinns where youve gone tell madam pomfrey i have given mypermissionharry and ron walked away hardly daring to believe that theydavoided detention as they turned the corner they distinctly heardprofessor mcgonagall blow her nosethat said ron fervently was the best story youve ever come upwiththey had no choice now but to go to the hospital wing and tell madampomfrey that they had professor mcgonagalls permission to visithermionemadam pomfrey let them in but reluctantlytheres just no point talking to a petrified person she said and theyhad to admit she had a point when theyd taken their seats next tohermione it was plain that hermione didnt have the faintest inklingthat she had visitors and that they might just as well tell her bedsidecabinet not to worry for all the good it would dowonder if she did see the attacker though said ron looking sadlyat hermiones rigid face because if he sneaked up on them all noonell ever know but harry wasnt looking at hermiones face he was more interestedin her right hand it lay clenched on top of her blankets and bendingcloser he saw that a piece of paper was scrunched inside her fistmaking sure that madam pomfrey was nowhere near he pointed thisout to rontg and get it out ron whispered shifting his chair so that heblocked harry from madam pomfreys viewit was no easy task hermiones hand was clamped so tightly aroundthe paper that harry was sure he was going to tear it while ron keptwatch he tugged and twisted and at last after several tense minutesthe paper came freeit was a page torn from a very old library book harry smoothed it outeagerly and ron leaned close to read it tooof the many fearsome beasts and monsters that roam our landthere is none more curious or more deadly than the basiliskknown also as the king of serpents this snake which mayreach gigantic size and live many hundreds of years is bornfrom a chickens egg hatched beneath a toad its methods of killing aremost wondrous for aside from its deadly and venomous fangs the basiliskhas a murderous stare and all who are fixed with the beam of its eye shallsuffer instant death spiders flee before the basilisk for it is their mortalenemy and the basilisk flees only from the crowing of the rooster which isfatal to itand beneath this a single word had been written in a hand harryrecognized as hermiones pipesit was as though somebody had just flicked a light on in his brainron he breathed this is it this is the answer the monster in thechambers a basilisk a giant serpent that why ive been hearingthat voice all over the place and nobody else has heard it its becausei understand parseltongue harry looked up at the beds around himthe basilisk kills people by looking at them but no ones died because no one looked it straight in the eye colin saw it through hiscamera the basilisk burned up all the film inside it but colin just gotpetrified justin justin mustve seen the basilisk through nearlyheadless nick nick got the full blast of it but he couldnt die again and hermione and that ravenclaw prefect were found with amirror next to them hermione had just realized the monster was abasilisk i bet you anything she warned the first person she met tolook around corners with a mirror first and that girl pulled out hermirror and rods jaw had droppedand mrs norris he whispered eagerlyharry thought hard picturing the scene on the night of halloweenthe water he said slowly the flood from moaning myrtlesbathroom i bet you mrs norris only saw the reflection he scanned the page in his hand eagerly the more he looked at itthe more it made sensethe crowing of the rooster is fatal to it he read aloud hagridsroosters were killed the heir of slytherin didnt want one anywherenear the castle once the chamber was opened spidersflee before it itall fitsbut hows the basilisk been getting around the place said ron agiant snake someone wouldve seen harry however pointed at the word hermione had scribbled at thefoot of the pagepipes he said pipes ron its been using the plumbing ivebeen hearing that voice inside the walls ron suddenly grabbed harrys armthe entrance to the chamber of secrets he said hoarselywhat if its a bathroom what if its in moaning myrtles bathroom said harrythey sat there excitement coursing through them hardly ableto believe itthis means said harry i cant be the only parselmouth inthe school the heir of slytherins one too thats how hes beencontrolling the basiliskwhatre we going to do said ron whose eyes were flashingshould we go straight to mcgonagalllets go to the staff room said harry jumping up shell bethere in ten minutes its nearly breakthey ran downstairs not wanting to be discovered hangingaround in another corridor they went straight into the desertedstaff room it was a large paneled room full of dark wooden chairsharry and ron paced around it too excited to sit downbut the bell to signal break never cameinstead echoing through the corridors came professor mcgonagalls voice magically magnifiedall students to return to their house dormitories at once all teachers return to the staff room immediately please harry wheeled around to stare at ronnot another attack not nowwhatll we do said ron aghast go back to the dormitoryno said harry glancing around there was an ugly sort ofwardrobe to his left full of the teachers cloaks in here lets hearwhat its all about then we can tell them what weve found outthey hid themselves inside it listening to the rumbling of hundreds ofpeople moving overhead and the staff room door banging openfrom between the musty folds of the cloaks they watched theteachers filtering into the room some of them were looking puzzledothers downright scared then professor mcgonagall arrivedit has happened she told the silent staff room a student has beentaken by the monster right into the chamber itselfprofessor flitwick let out a squeal professor sprout clapped herhands over her mouth snape gripped the back of a chair very hardand said how can you be surethe heir of slytherin said professor mcgonagall who was

mcgonagalltonight will be an excellent time to do it well make sure everyonesout of your way youll be able to tackle the monster all by youself afree rein at lastlockhart gazed desperately around him but nobody came to therescue he didnt look remotely handsome anymore his lip wastrembling and in the absence of his usually toothy grin he lookedweakchinned and feeblev very well he said ill ill be in

students what has happened tell them thehogwarts express will take them home first thing tomorrow will therest of you please make sure no students have been left outside theirdormitoriesthe teachers rose and left one by oneit was probably the worst day of harrys entire life he ron fredand george sat together in a corner of the gryffindor common roomunable to say anything to each other percy wasnt there he had goneto send an owl to mr and mrs weasley then shut himself up in hisdormitoryno afternoon ever lasted as long as that one nor had gryffindortower ever been so crowded yet so quiet near

try and get into thechamber we can tell him where we think it is and tell him its abasilisk in therebecause harry couldnt think of anything else to do and because hewanted to be doing something he agreed the gryffindors aroundthem were so miserable and felt so sorry for the weasleys thatnobody tried to stop them as they got up crossed the room and leftthrough the portrait holedarkness was falling as they walked down to lockharts officethere seemed to be a lot of activity going on inside it they could hearscraping thumps and hurried footstepsharry knocked and there was a sudden silence from inside then thedoor opened the tiniest crack and they saw one of lockharts eyespeering through itoh mr potter mr weasley he said opening the door a bitwider im rather busy at the moment if you would be quick professor weve got some information for you said harry wethink itll help youer well its not terribly the side of lockharts face that theycould see looked very uncomfortable i mean well all right he opened the door and they enteredhis office had been almost completely stripped two large trunksstood open on the floor robes jadegreen lilac midnightblue hadbeen hastily folded into one of them books were jumbled untidily intothe other the photographs that had covered the walls were nowcrammed into boxes on the deskare you going somewhere said harryer well yes said lockhart ripping a lifesize poster of himself fromthe back of the door as he spoke and starting to roll it up urgent call unavoidable got to go what about my sister said ron jerkilywell as to that most unfortunate said lockhart avoiding theireyes as he wrenched open a drawer and started emptying the contentsinto a bag no one regrets more than i youre the defense against the dark arts teacher said harryyou cant go

frowning at harrydo use your common sense my books wouldnt have sold half aswell if people didnt think id done all those things no one wants toread about some ugly old armenian warlock even if he did save avillage from werewolves hed look dreadful on the front cover nodress sense at all and the witch who banished the bandon bansheehad a harelip i mean come on so youve just been taking credit for what a load of other people havedone said harry incredulouslyharry harry said lockhart shaking his head impatiently its notnearly as simple as that there was work involved i hadto track these people down ask them exactly how they managed todo what they did then i had to put a memory charm on them so theywouldnt remember doing it if theres one thing i pride myself on itsmy memory charms no its been a lot of work harry its not allbook signings and publicity photos you know you want fame youhave to be prepared for a long hard sloghe banged the lids of his trunks shut and locked themlets see he said i think thats everything yes only one thinglefthe pulled out his wand and turned to themawfully sorry boys but ill have to put a memory charm on younow cant have you blabbing my secrets all over the place id neversell another book harry reached his wand just in time lockhart had barely raised hiswhen harry bellowed expelliarmuslockhart was blasted backward falling over his trunk his wand flewhigh into the air ron caught it and flung it out of the open windowshouldnt have let professor snape teach us that one said harryfuriously kicking lockharts trunk aside lockhart was looking up athim feeble once more harry was still pointing his wand at himwhat dyou want me to do said lockhart weakly i dont knowwhere the chamber of secrets is theres nothing i can doyoure in luck said harry forcing lockhart to his feet at wandpointwe think we know where it is and whats inside it lets gothey marched lockhart out of his office and down the nearest stairsalong the dark corridor where the messages shone on the wall to thedoor of moaning myrtles bathroomthey sent lockhart in first harry was pleased to see that he wasshakingmoaning myrtle was sitting on the tank of the end toiletoh its you she said when she saw harry what do you want thistimeto ask you how you died said harrymyrtles whole aspect changed at once she looked as though she hadnever been asked such a flattering questionooooh it was dreadful she said with relish it happened right inhere i died in this very stall i remember it so well id hidden becauseolive hornby was teasing me about my glasses the door was lockedand i was crying and then i heard somebody come in they saidsomething funny a different language i think it must have beenanyway what really got me was that it was a boy speaking so iunlocked the door to tell him to go and use his own toilet and then myrtle swelled importantly her face shining i diedhow said harryno idea said myrtle in hushed tones i just remember seeing a pairof great big yellow eyes my whole body sort of seized up and then iwas floating away she looked dreamily at harry and then icame back again i was determined to haunt olive hornby you seeoh she was sorry shed ever laughed at my glasseswhere exactly did you see the eyes said harrysomewhere there said myrtle pointing vaguely toward the sink infront of her toiletharry and ron hurried over to it lockhart was standing well back alook of utter terror on his faceit looked like an ordinary sink they examined every inch of it insideand out including the pipes below and then harry saw it scratchedon the side of one of the copper taps was a tiny snakethat taps never worked said myrtle brightly as he tried to turn itharry said ron say something something in parseltonguebut harry thought hard the only times hed ever managed tospeak parseltongue were when hed been faced with a real snake hestared hard at the tiny engraving trying to imagine it was realopen up he saidhe looked at ron who shook his headenglish he saidharry looked back at the snake willing himself to believe it was aliveif he moved his head the candlelight made it look as though it weremovingopen up he saidexcept that the words werent what he heard a strange hissing hadescaped him and at once the tap glowed with a brilliant white light andbegan to spin next second the sink began to move the sink in factsank right out of sight leaving a large pipe exposed a pipe wideenough for a man to slide intoharry heard ron gasp and looked up again he had made up his mindwhat he was going to doim going down there he said he couldnt not go not now they had found the entrance to thechamber not if there was even the faintest slimmest wildest chancethat ginny might be aliveme too said ronthere was a pausewell you hardly seem to need me said lockhart with a shadowof his old smile ill just he put his hand on the door knob but ron and harry both pointedtheir wands at himyou can go first ron snarledwhitefaced and wandless lockhart approached the openingboys he said his voice feeble boys what good will it doharry jabbed him in the back with his wand lockhart slid his legsinto the pipei really dont think he started to say but ron gave him a pushand he slid out of sight harry followed quickly he lowered himselfslowly into the pipe then let goit was like rushing down an endless slimy dark slide he could seemore pipes branching off in all directions but none as large as theirswhich twisted and turned sloping steeply downward and he knewthat he was falling deeper below the school than even the dungeonsbehind him he could hear ron thudding slightly at the curvesand then just as he had begun to worry about what would happenwhen he hit the ground the pipe leveled out and he shot out of theend with a wet thud landing on the damp floor of a dark stone tunnellarge enough to stand in lockhart was getting to hisfeet a little ways away covered in slime and white as a ghost harrystood aside as ron came whizzing out of the pipe toowe must be miles under the school said harry his voice echoing inthe black tunnelunder the lake probably said ron squinting around at the darkslimy wallsall three of them turned to stare into the darkness aheadlumos harry muttered to his wand and it lit again cmon hesaid to ron and lockhart and off they went their footsteps slappingloudly on the wet floorthe tunnel was so dark that they could only see a little distance aheadtheir shadows on the wet walls looked monstrous in the wandlightremember harry said quietly as they walked cautiously forwardany sign of movement close your eyes right away but the tunnel was quiet as the grave and the first unexpected soundthey heard was a loud crunch as ron stepped on what turned out to bea rats skull harry lowered his wand to look at the floor and saw thatit was littered with small animal bones trying very hard not toimagine what ginny might look like if they found her harry led theway forward around a dark bend in the tunnelharry theres something up there said ron hoarsely grabbingharrys shoulderthey froze watching harry could just see the outline of somethinghuge and curved lying right across the tunnel it wasnt movingmaybe its asleep he breathed glancing back at the other twolockharts hands were pressed over his eyes harry turned back tolook at the thing his heart beating so fast it hurtvery slowly his eyes as narrow as he could make them and still seeharry edged forward his wand held highthe light slid over a gigantic snake skin of a vivid poisonous greenlying curled and empty across the tunnel floor the creature that hadshed it must have been twenty feet long at leastblimey said ron weaklythere was a sudden movement behind them gilderoy lockhartsknees had given wayget up said ron sharply pointing his wand at lockhartlockhart got to his feet then he dived at ron knocking him to thegroundharry jumped forward but too late lockhart was straightening uppanting rons wand in his hand and a gleaming smile back on hisfacethe adventure ends here boys he said i shall take a bit of thisskin back up to the school tell them i was too late to save the girland that you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of hermangled body say goodbye to your memorieshe raised rons spellotaped wand high over his head and yelledobliviatethe wand exploded with the force of a small bomb harry flung hisarms over his head and ran slipping over the coils of snake skin outof the way of great chunks of tunnel ceiling that were thundering tothe floor next moment he was standing alone gazing at a solid wallof broken rockron he shouted are you okay ronim here came rons muffled voice from behind the rockfall imokay this gits not though he got blasted by the wand there was a dull thud and a loud ow it sounded as though ron hadjust kicked lockhart in the shinswhat now rons voice said sounding desperate we cant getthrough itll take ages harry looked up at the tunnel ceiling huge cracks had appeared in ithe had never tried to break apart anything as large as these rocks bymagic and now didnt seem a good moment to try what if the wholetunnel caved inthere was another thud and another ow from behind the rocksthey were wasting time ginny had already been in the chamber ofsecrets for hours harry knew there was only one thing to dowait there he called to ron wait with lockhart ill go on if imnot back in an hour there was a very pregnant pauseill try and shift some of this rock said ron who seemed to be tryingto keep his voice steady so you can can get back through andharry see you in a bit said harry trying to inject some confidence into hisshaking voiceand he set off alone past the giant snake skinsoon the distant noise of ron straining to shift the rocks was gonethe tunnel turned and turned again every nerve in harrys body wastingling unpleasantly he wanted the tunnel to end yet dreaded whathed find when it did and then at last as he crept around yet anotherbend he saw a solid wall ahead on which two entwined serpents werecarved their eyes set with great glinting emeraldsharry approached his throat very dry there was no need to pretendthese stone snakes were real their eyes looked strangely alivehe could guess what he had to do he cleared his throat and theemerald eyes seemed to flickeropen said harry in a low faint hissthe serpents parted as the wall cracked open the halves slid smoothlyout of sight and harry shaking from head to foot walked insidee was standing at the end of a very long dimly lit chamber toweringstone pillars entwined with more carved serpents rose to support aceiling lost in darkness casting long black shadows through the oddgreenish gloom that filled the placehis heart beating very fast harry stood listening to the chill silencecould the basilisk be lurking in a shadowy corner behind a pillar andwhere was ginnyhe pulled out his wand and moved forward between the serpentinecolumns every careful footstep echoed loudly off the shadowy wallshe kept his eyes narrowed ready to clamp them shut at the smallestsign of movement the hollow eye sockets of the stone snakesseemed to be following him more than once with a jolt of thestomach he thought he saw one stirthen as he drew level with the last pair of pillars a statue high as thechamber itself loomed into view standing against the back wallharry had to crane his neck to look up into the giant face above itwas ancient and monkeyish with a long thin beard that fell almost tothe bottom of the wizards sweeping stone robes where twoenormous gray feet stood on the smooth chamber floor and betweenthe feet facedown lay a small blackrobed figure with flamingredhairtinny harry muttered sprinting to her and dropping to his kneestinny dont be dead please dont be dead he flung his wandaside grabbed ginnys shoulders and turned her over her face waswhite as marble and as cold yet her eyes were closed so she wasntpetrified but then she must beginny please wake up harry muttered desperately shaking herginnys head lolled hopelessly from side to sideshe wont wake said a soft voiceharry jumped and spun around on his kneesa tall blackhaired boy was leaning against the nearest pillarwatching he was strangely blurred around the edges as thoughharry were looking at him through a misted window but there wasno mistaking himtom tom riddleriddle nodded not taking his eyes off harrys facewhat dyou mean she wont wake harry said desperately shesnot shes not shes still alive said riddle but only justharry stared at him tom riddle had been at hogwarts fifty yearsago yet here he stood a weird misty light shining about him not a dayolder than sixteenare you a ghost harry said uncertainlya memory said riddle quietly preserved in a diary for fifty yearshe pointed toward the floor near the statues giant toes lying openthere was the little black diary harry had found in moaning myrtlesbathroom for a second harry wondered how it had got there butthere were more pressing matters to deal withyouve got to help me tom harry said raising ginnys head againweve got to get her out of here theres a basilisk i dont knowwhere it is but it could be along any moment please help me riddle didnt move harry sweating managed to hoist ginny half offthe floor and bent to pick up his wand againbut his wand had gonedid you see he looked up riddle was still watching him twirling harrys wandbetween his long fingersthanks said harry stretching out his hand for ita smile curled the corners of riddles mouth he continued to stare atharry twirling the wand idlylisten said harry urgently his knees sagging with ginnys deadweight weve got to go if the basilisk comes it wont come until it is called said riddle calmlyharry lowered ginny back onto the floor unable to hold her up anylongerwhat dyou

broadly and hepocketed harrys wandharry stared at him there was something very funny going on herehow did ginny get like this he asked slowlywell thats an interesting question said riddle pleasantly and quitea long story i suppose the real reason ginny weasleys like this isbecause she opened her heart and spilled all her secrets to an invisiblestrangerwhat are you talking about said harrythe

everunderstood me like you tom im so glad ive got this diary toconfide in its like having a friend i can carry around in my pocket riddle laughed a high cold laugh that didnt suit him it made the hairsstand up on the back of harrys neckif i say it myself harry ive always been able to charm the people ineeded so ginny poured out her soul to me and her soul happened tobe exactly what i wanted i grew stronger and stronger on a diet ofher deepest fears her darkest secrets i grew powerful far morepowerful than little miss weasley powerful enough to start feedingmiss weasley a few of my secrets to start pouring a little of my soulback into her what dyou mean said harry whose mouth had gone very dryhavent you guessed yet harry potter said riddle softly ginnyweasley opened the chamber of secrets she strangled the schoolroosters and daubed threatening messages on the walls she set theserpent of slytherin on four mudbloods and the squibs catno harry whisperedyes said riddle calmly of course she didnt know what she wasdoing at first it was very amusing i wish you could have seen hernew diary entries far more interesting they became dear tomhe recited watching harrys horrified face i think im losing mymemory there are rooster feathers all over my robes and dont know howthey got there dear tom l cant remember what did on the night ofhalloween but a cat was attacked and ive got paint all down my frontdear tom percy keeps telling me im pale and im not myself i think hesuspects me there was another attack todayand i dont know where i was tom what am i going to do i think imgoing mad i think im the one attacking everyone tomharrys fists were clenched the nails digging deep into his palmsit took a very long time for stupid little ginny to stop trusting herdiary said riddle but she finally became suspicious and tried todispose of it and thats where you came in harry you found it and icouldnt have been more delighted of all the people who could havepicked it up it was you the very person i was most anxious to meet and why did you want to meet me said harry anger was coursingthrough him and it was an effort to keep his voice steadywell you see ginny told me all about you harry said riddle yourwhole fascinating history his eyes roved over the lightning scar onharrys forehead and their expression grew hungrier i knew i mustfind out more about you talk to you meet you if i could so i decidedto show you my famous capture of that great oaf hagrid to gain yourtrust hagrids my friend said harry his voice now shaking and youframed him didnt you i thought you made a mistake but riddle laughed his high laugh againit was my word against hagrids harry well you can imagine howit looked to old armando dippet on the one hand tom riddle poorbut brilliant parentless but so brave school prefect model student on the other hand big blundering hagrid in trouble every other weektrying to raise werewolf cubs under his bed sneaking off to theforbidden forest to wrestle trolls but il admit even i was surprised how well the plan worked i thoughtsomeone must realize that hagrid couldnt possibly be the heir ofslytherin it had taken me five whole years to find out everything icould about the chamber of secrets and discover the secret entranceas though hagrid had the brains or the poweronly the transfiguration teacher dumbledore seemed to thinkhagrid was innocent he persuaded dipper to keep hagrid and trainhim as gamekeeper yes i think dumbledore might have guessed dumbledore never seemed to like me as much as the other teachersdid i bet dumbledore saw right through you said harry his teeth grittedwell he certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after hagridwas expelled said riddle carelessly i knew it wouldnt be safe toopen the chamber again while i was still at school but i wasnt goingto waste those long years id spent searching for it i decided to leavebehind a diary preserving my sixteenyearold self in its pages so thatone day with luck i would be able to lead another in my footsteps andfinish salazar slytherins noble workwell you havent finished it said harry triumphantly no ones diedthis time not even the cat in a few hours the mandrake draught willbe ready and everyone who was petrified will be all right again havent i already told you said riddle quietly that killing mudbloodsdoesnt matter to me anymore for many months now my new targethas been youharry stared at himimagine how angry i was when the next time my diary wasopened it was ginny who was writing to me not you she saw youwith the diary you see and panicked what if you found out how towork it and i repeated all her secrets to you what if even worse itold you whod been strangling roosters so the foolish little brat waiteduntil your dormitory was deserted and stole it back but i knew what imust do it was clear to me that you were on the trail of slytherinsheir from everything ginny had told me about you i knew you wouldgo to any lengths to solve the mystery particularly if one of your best friends was attacked and ginny hadtold me the whole school was buzzing because you could speakparseltongue so i made ginny write her own farewell on the wall and come downhere to wait she struggled and cried and became very boring butthere isnt much life left in her she put too much into the diary intome enough to let me leave its pages at last i have been waiting foryou to appear since we arrived here i knew youd come i have manyquestions for you harry potterlike what harry spat fists still clenchedwell said riddle smiling pleasantly how is it that you a skinny boywith no extraordinary magical talent managed to defeat the greatestwizard of all time how did you escape with nothing but a scar whilelord voldemorts powers were destroyedthere was an odd red gleam in his hungry eyes nowwhy do you care how i escaped said harry slowly voldemort wasafter your time voldemort said riddle softly is my past present and future harrypotter he pulled harrys wand from his pocket and began to trace itthrough the air writing three shimmering wordstom marvolo riddlethen he waved the wand once and the letters of his namerearranged themselvesi am lord voldemortyou see he whispered it was a name i was already using athogwarts to my most intimate friends only of course you think iwas going to use my filthy muggle fathers name forever i in whoseveins runs the blood of salazar slytherin himself through mymothers side i keep the name of a foul common muggle whoabandoned me even before i was born just because he found out hiswife was a witch no harry i fashioned myself a new name aname i knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speakwhen i had become the greatest sorcerer in the worldharrys brain seemed to have jammed he stared numbly at riddleat the orphaned boy who had grown up to murder harrys ownparents and so many others at last he forced himself to peakyoure not he said his quiet voice full of hatrednot what snapped riddlenot the greatest sorcerer in the world said harry breathing fastsorry to disappoint you and all that but the greatest wizard in theworld is albus dumbledore everyone says so even when you werestrong you didnt dare try and take over at hogwarts dumbledoresaw through you when you were at school and he still frightens younow wherever youre hiding these days the smile had gone from riddles face to be replaced by a very uglylookdumbledores been driven out of this castle by the mere memory ofme he hissedhes not as gone as you might think harry retorted he wasspeaking at random wanting to scare riddle wishing rather thanbelieving it to be trueriddle opened his mouth but frozemusic was coming from somewhere riddle whirled around to staredown the empty chamber the music was growing louder it waseerie spinetingling unearthly it lifted the hair on harrys scalp andmade his heart feel as though it was swelling to twice its normal sizethen as the music reached such a pitch that harry felt it vibratinginside his own ribs flames erupted at the top of the nearest pillara crimson bird the size of a swan had appeared piping its weird musicto the vaulted ceiling it had a glittering golden tail as long as apeacocks and gleaming golden talons which were gripping a raggedbundlea second later the bird was flying straight at harry it dropped theragged thing it was carrying at his feet then landed heavily on hisshoulder as it folded its great wings harry looked up and saw it had along sharp golden beak and a beady black eyethe bird stopped singing it sat still and warm next to harrys cheekgazing steadily at riddlethats a phoenix said riddle staring shrewdly back at itfawkes harry breathed and he felt the birds golden clawssqueeze his shoulder gentlyand that said riddle now eyeing the ragged thing that fawkes haddropped thats the old school sorting hat so it was patched frayed and dirty the hat lay motionless at harrysfeetriddle began to laugh again he laughed so hard that the darkchamber rang with it as though ten riddles were laughing at oncethis is what dumbledore sends his defender a songbird and an oldhat do you feel brave harry potter do you feel safe nowharry didnt answer he might not see what use fawkes or thesorting hat were but he was no longer alone and he waited forriddle to stop laughing with his courage mountingto business harry said riddle still smiling broadly twice in yourpast in my future we have met and twice i failed to kill you howdid you survive tell me everything the longer you talk he addedsoftly the longer you stay aliveharry was thinking fast weighing his chances riddle had the wandhe harry had fawkes and the sorting hat neither of which wouldbe much good in a duel it looked bad all right but the longer riddlestood there the more life was dwindling out of ginny and in themeantime harry noticed suddenly riddles outline was becomingclearer more solid if it had to be a fight between him and riddlebetter sooner than laterno one knows why you lost your powers when you attacked mesaid harry abruptly i dont know myself but i know why youcouldnt kill me because my mother died to save me my commonmuggleborn mother he added shaking with suppressed rage shestopped you killing me and ive seen the real you i saw you lastyear youre a wreck youre barely alive thats where all yourpower got you youre in hiding youre ugly youre foul riddles face contorted then he forced it into an awful smile soyour mother died to save you yes thats a powerful countercharm ican see now there is nothing special about you after all iwondered you see there are strange likenesses between us after alleven you must have noticed both halfbloods orphans raised bymuggles probably the only two parselmouths to come to hogwartssince the great slytherin himself we even look something alike butafter all it was merely a lucky chance that saved you from me thatsall i wanted to knowharry stood tense waiting for riddle to raise his wand but riddlestwisted smile was widening againnow harry im going to teach you a little lesson lets match thepowers of lord voldemort heir of salazar slytherin against famousharry potter and the best weapons dumbledore can give him he cast an amused eye over fawkes and the sorting hat then walkedaway harry fear spreading up his numb legs watched ridthe stopbetween the high pillars and look up into the stone face of slytherinhigh above him in the halfdarkness riddle opened his mouth wide andhissed but harry understood what he was saying speak to me slytherin greatest of the hogwarts four harry wheeled around to look up at the statue fawkes swaying on hisshoulderslytherins gigantic stone face was moving horrorstruck harry sawhis mouth opening wider and wider to make a huge black holeand something was stirring inside the statues mouth somethingwas slithering up from its depths harry backed away until he hit the dark chamber wall and as he shuthis eyes tight he felt fawkes wing sweep his cheek as he took flightharry wanted to shout dont leave me but what chance did aphoenix have against the king of serpentssomething huge hit the stone floor of the chamber harry felt itshudder he knew what was happening he could sense it couldalmost see the giant serpent uncoiling itself from slytherins mouththen he heard riddles hissing voicekill him the basilisk was moving toward harry he could hear its heavy bodyslithering heavily across the dusty floor eyes still tightly shut harrybegan to run blindly sideways his hands outstretched feeling his way voldemort was laughingharry tripped he fell hard onto the stone and tasted blood the serpentwas barely feet from him he could hear it comingthere was a loud explosive spitting sound right above him and thensomething heavy hit harry so hard that he was smashed into the wallwaiting for fangs to sink through his body he heard more mad hissingsomething thrashing wildly off the pillarshe couldnt help it he opened his eyes wide enough to squint at whatwas going onthe enormous serpent bright poisonous green thick as an oak trunkhad raised itself high in the air and its great blunt head was weavingdrunkenly between the pillars as harry trembled ready to close hiseyes if it turned he saw what had distracted the snakefawkes was soaring around its head and the basilisk was snappingfuriously at him with fangs long and thin as sabersfawkes dived his long golden beak sank out of sight and asudden shower of dark blood spattered the floor the snakes tailthrashed narrowly missing harry and before harry could shut hiseyes it turned harry looked straight into its face and saw that itseyes both its great bulbous yellow eyes had been punctured by thephoenix blood was streaming to the floor and the snake was spittingin agonyno harry heard riddle screaming leave the bird leavethe bird the boy is behind you you can still smellhim kill himithe blinded serpent swayed confused still deadly fawkes wascircling its head piping his eerie song jabbing here and there at itsscaly nose as the blood poured from its ruined eyeshelp me help me harry muttered wildly someone anyonethe snakes tail whipped across the floor again harry duckedsomething soft hit his facethe basilisk had swept the sorting hat into harrys arms harryseized it it was all he had left his only chance he rammed it onto hishead and threw himself flat onto the floor as the basilisks tail swungover him againhelp me help me harry thought his eyes screwed tight under the hatplease help methere was no answering voice instead the hat contracted as thoughan invisible hand was squeezing it very tightlysomething very hard and heavy thudded onto the top of harrys headalmost knocking him out stars winking in front of his eyes he grabbedthe top of the hat to pull it off and felt something long and hardbeneath ita gleaming silver sword had appeared inside the hat its handleglittering with rubies the size of eggskill the boy leave the bird the boy is behind yousniff smell himharry was on his feet ready the basilisks head was falling its bodycoiling around hitting pillars as it twisted to face him he could see thevast bloody eye sockets see the mouth stretching wide wide enoughto swallow him whole lined with fangs long as his sword thinglittering venomous it lunged blindly harry dodged and it hit the chamber wall it lungedagain and its forked tongue lashed harrys side he raised the swordin both his hands the basilisk lunged again and this time its aim was true harry threwhis whole weight behind the sword and drove it to the hilt into the roofof the serpents mouth but as warm blood drenched harrys arms he felt a searing pain justabove his elbow one long poisonous fang was sinking deeper anddeeper into his arm and it splintered as the basilisk keeled oversideways and fell twitching to the floorharry slid down the wall he gripped the fang that was spreadingpoison through his body and wrenched it out of his arm but he knew itwas too late whitehot pain was spreading slowly and steadily fromthe wound even as he dropped the fang and watched his own bloodsoaking his robes his vision went foggy the chamber was dissolvingin a whirl of dull colora patch of scarlet swam past and harry heard a soft clatter of clawsbeside himfawkes said harry thickly you were fantastic fawkes he felt the bird lay its beautiful head on the spot where the serpentsfang had pierced himhe could hear echoing footsteps and then a dark shadow moved infront of himyoure dead harry potter said riddles voice above him deadeven dumbledores bird knows it do you see what hes doing potterhes cryingharry blinked fawkes head slid in and out of focus thick pearly tearswere trickling down the glossy feathersim going to sit here and watch you die harry potter take

defeated at last bythe dark lord he so unwisely challenged youll be back with your dearmudblood mother soon harry she bought you twelve years ofborrowed time but lord voldemort got you in the end as you knewhe must if this is dying thought harry its not so badeven the pain was leaving him but was this dying instead of going black the chamber seemed to becoming back into focus harry gave his head a little shake and there wasfawkes still resting his head on harrys arm a pearly patch of tears wasshining all around the wound except that there was no woundget away bird said riddles voice suddenly get away from him i said get away harry raised his head riddle was pointing harrys wand atfawkes there was a bang like a gun and fawkes took flight again in awhirl of gold and scarletphoenix tears said riddle quietly staring at harrys arm ofcourse healing powers i forgot he looked into harrys face but it makes no difference in fact iprefer it this way just you and me harry potter you and mehe raised the wandthen in a rush of wings fawkes had soared back overhead andsomething fell into harrys lap the diaryfor a split second both harry and riddle wand still raised stared at itthen without thinking without considering as though he had meant todo it all along harry seized the basilisk fang on the floor next to himand plunged it straight into the heart of the bookthere was a long dreadful piercing scream ink spurted out of thediary in torrents streaming over harrys hands flooding the floorriddle was writhing and twisting screaming and flailing and thenhe had gone harrys wand fell to the floor with a clatter and therewas silence silence except for the steady drip drip of ink still oozingfrom the diary the basilisk venom had burned a sizzling hole rightthrough itshaking all over harry pulled himself up his head was spinning asthough hed just traveled miles by floo powder slowly he gatheredtogether his wand and the sorting hat and with a huge tug retrievedthe glittering sword from the roof of the basilisks mouththen came a faint moan from the end of the chamber ginny wasstirring as harry hurried toward her she sat up her bemusedeyes traveled from the huge form of the dead basilisk over harry inhis bloodsoaked robes then to the diary in his hand she drew a greatshuddering gasp and tears began to pour down her faceharry oh harry i tried to tell you at bbreakfast but i ccouldntsay it in front of percy it was me harry but i i sswear i ddiddtmean to rriddle made me he ttook me over and howdid you kill that that thing wwheres riddle the last thing i rrememberis him

hovering in the chamber entranceharry urged ginny forward they stepped over the motionless coils ofthe dead basilisk through the echoing gloom and back into the tunnelharry heard the stone doors close behind them with a soft hissafter a few minutes progress up the dark tunnel a distant sound ofslowly shifting rock reached harrys earsron harry yelled speeding up ginnys okay ive got herhe heard ron give a strangled cheer and they turned the next bend tosee his eager face staring through the sizable gap he had managed tomake in the rock fallginny ron thrust an arm through the gap in the rock to pullher through first youre alive i dont believe it what happenedhow what where did that bird come fromfawkes had swooped through the gap after ginnyhes dumbledores said harry squeezing through himselfhow come youve got a sword said ron gaping at the glitteringweapon in harrys handill explain when we get out of here said harry with a sidewaysglance at ginny who was crying harder than everbut later harry said shortly he didnt think it was a good idea to tellron yet whod been opening the chamber not in front of ginnyanyway wheres lockhartback there said ron still looking puzzled but jerking his head up thetunnel toward the pipe hes in a bad way come and seeled by fawkes whose wide scarlet wings emitted a soft golden glowin the darkness they walked all the way back to the mouth of the pipegilderoy lockhart was sitting there humming placidly to himselfhis memorys gone said ron the memory charm backfired hithim instead of us hasnt got a clue who he is or where he is or whowe are i told him to come and wait here hes a danger to himselflockhart peered goodnaturedly up at them allhello he said odd sort of place this isnt it do you live hereno said ron raising his eyebrows at harryharry bent down and looked up the long dark pipehave you thought how were going to get back up this he said toronron shook his head but fawkes the phoenix had swooped past harryand was now fluttering in front of him his beady eyes bright in thedark he was waving his long golden tail feathers harry lookeduncertainly at himhe looks like he wants you to grab hold said ron lookingperplexed but youre much too heavy for a bird to pull up there fawkes said harry isnt an ordinary bird he turned quickly to theothers weve got to hold on to each other ginny grab rons handprofessor lockhart he means you said ron sharply to lockhartyou hold ginnys other hand harry tucked the sword and the sorting hat into his belt ron tookhold of the back of harrys robes and harry reached out and tookhold of fawkess strangely hot tail feathersan extraordinary lightness seemed to spread through his whole bodyand the next second in a rush of wings they were flying upwardthrough the pipe harry could hear lockhart dangling below himsaying amazing amazing this is just like magic the chill air waswhipping through harrys hair and before hed stopped enjoying theride it was over all four of them were hitting the wet floor ofmoaning myrtles bathroom and as lockhart straightened his hat thesink that hid the pipe was sliding back into placemyrtle goggled at themyoure alive she said blankly to harrytheres no need to sound so disappointed he said grimly wipingflecks of blood and slime off his glassesoh well id just been thinking if you had died youd have beenwelcome to share my toilet said myrtle blushing silverurgh said ron as they left the bathroom for the dark desertedcorridor outside harry i think myrtles grown fond of you youvegot competition ginnybut tears were still flooding silently down ginnys facewhere now said ron with an anxious look at ginny harry pointedfawkes was leading the way glowing gold along the corridor theystrode after him and moments later found themselves outsideprofessor mcgonagalls officeharry knocked and pushed the door openg fi a p t e irk i g t v v ndoy rewardor a moment there was silence as harry ron ginny and lockhartstood in the doorway covered in muck and slime and in harrys caseblood then there was a screamginnyit was mrs weasley who had been sitting crying in front of the fireshe leapt to her feet closely followed by mr weasley and both ofthem flung themselves on their daughterharry however was looking past them professor dumbledore wasstanding by the mantelpiece beaming next to professor mcgonagallwho was taking great steadying gasps clutching her chest fawkeswent whooshing past harrys ear and settled on dumbledoresshoulder just as harry found himself and ron being swept into mrsweasleys tight embraceyou saved her you saved her how did you do iti think wed all like to know that said professor mcgonagall weaklymrs weasley let go of harry who hesitated for a moment thenwalked over to the desk and laid upon it the sorting hat therubyencrusted sword and what remained of riddles diarythen he started telling them everything for nearly a quarter of anhour he spoke into the rapt silence he told them about hearing thedisembodied voice how hermione had finally realized that he washearing a basilisk in the pipes how he and ron had followed thespiders into the forest that aragog had told them where the lastvictim of the basilisk had died how he had guessed that moaningmyrtle had been the victim and that the entrance to the chamber ofsecrets might be in her bathroom very well professor mcgonagall prompted him as he paused soyou found out where the entrance was breaking a hundred schoolrules into pieces along the way i might add but how on earth didyou all get out of there alive potterso harry his voice now growing hoarse from all this talking toldthem about fawkess timely arrival and about the sorting hat givinghim the sword but then he faltered he had so far avoidedmentioning riddles diary or ginny she was standing with herhead against mrs weasleys shoulder and tears were still coursingsilently down her cheeks what if they expelled her harry thought inpanic riddles diary didnt work anymore how could they proveit had been he whod made her do it allinstinctively harry looked at dumbledore who smiled faintly thefirelight glancing off his halfmoon spectacleswhat interests me most said dumbledore gently is how lordvoldemort managed to enchant ginny when my sources tell me he iscurrently in hiding in the forests of albaniarelief warm sweeping glorious relief swept over harry wwhatsthat said mr weasley in a stunned voice youknowwhoenenchant ginny but ginnys not ginny hasnt been has sheit was this diary said harry quickly picking it up and showing it todumbledore riddle wrote it when he was sixteen dumbledore took the diary from harry and peered keenly down hislong crooked nose at its burnt and soggy pagesbrilliant he said softly of course he was probably the mostbrilliant student hogwarts has ever seen he turned around to theweasleys who were looking utterly bewilderedvery few people know that lord voldemort was once called tomriddle i taught him myself fifty years ago at hogwarts hedisappeared after leaving the school traveled far and wide sankso deeply into the dark arts consorted with the very worst of ourkind underwent so many dangerous magical transformations thatwhen he resurfaced as lord voldemort he was barely recognizablehardly anyone connected lord voldemort with the cleverhandsome boy who was once head boy herebut ginny said mrs weasley whats our ginny got to do with with himhis ddiaryl ginny sobbed ive bbeen writing in it and hes beenwwriting back all year tinny said mr weasley flabbergasted havent i taught youanything what have i always told you never trust anything that canthink for itself if you cant see where it keeps its brain why didntyou show the diary to me or your mother a suspicious object likethat it was clearly full of dark magic i ddidnt know sobbed ginny i found it inside one of the booksmum got me i ththought someone had just left it in there andforgotten about it miss weasley should go up to the hospital wing right awaydumbledore interrupted in a firm voice this has been a terribleordeal for her there will be no punishment older and wiser wizardsthan she have been hoodwinked by lord voldemort he strode overto the door and opened it bed rest and perhaps a large steamingmug of hot chocolate i always find that cheers me up he addedtwinkling kindly down at her you will find that madam pomfrey isstill awake shes just giving out mandrake juice i daresay thebasilisks victims will be waking up any momentso hermiones okay said ron brightlythere has been no lasting harm done ginny said dumbledoremrs weasley led ginny out and mr weasley followed still lookingdeeply shakenyou know minerva professor dumbledore said thoughtfully toprofessor mcgonagall i think all this merits a good feast might i askyou to go and alert the kitchensright said professor mcgonagall crisply also moving to the doorill leave you to deal with potter and weasley shall icertainly said dumbledoreshe left and harry and ron gazed uncertainly at dumbledore whatexactly had professor mcgonagall meant deal with them surely surely they werent about to be punishedi seem to remember telling you both that i would have to expel you ifyou broke any more school rules said dumbledoreron opened his mouth in horrorwhich goes to show that the best of us must sometimes eat ourwords dumbledore went on smiling you will both receive specialawards for services to the school and let me see yes i think twohundred points apiece for gryffindorron went as briglitly pink as lockharts valentine flowers and closedhis mouth againbut one of us seems to be keeping mightily quiet about his part in thisdangerous adventure dumbledore added why so modestgilderoyharry gave a start he had completely forgotten about lockhart heturned and saw that lockhart was standing in a corner of the roomstill wearing his vague smile when dumbledore addressed himlockhart looked over his shoulder to see who he was talking toprofessor dumbledore ron said quickly there was an accidentdown in the chamber of secrets professor lockhart am i a professor said lockhart in mild surprise goodness iexpect i was hopeless was ihe tried to do a memory charm and the wand backfired ronexplained quietly to dumbledoredear me said dumbledore shaking his head his long silvermustache quivering impaled upon your own sword gilderoysword said lockhart dimly havent got a sword that boy hasthough he pointed at harry hell lend you onewould you mind taking professor lockhart up to the infirmary toodumbledore said to ron id like a few more words with harry lockhart ambled out ron cast a curious look back at dumbledore andharry as he closed the doordumbledore crossed to one of the chairs by the firesit down harry he said and harry sat feeling unaccountablynervousfirst of all harry i want to thank you said dumbledore eyestwinkling again you must have shown me real loyalty down in thechamber nothing but that could have called fawkes to youhe stroked the phoenix which had fluttered down onto his kneeharry grinned awkwardly as dumbledore watched himand so you met tom riddle said dumbledore thoughtfully iimagine he was most interested in you suddenly something that was nagging at harry came tumbling out ofhis mouthprofessor dumbledore riddle said im like him strange likenesseshe said did he now said dumbledore looking thoughtfully at harry fromunder his thick silver eyebrows and what do you think harryi dont think im like him said harry more loudly than hed intendedi mean im im in gryffindor im but he fell silent a lurking doubt resurfacing in his mindprofessor he started again after a moment the sorting hat told meid id have done well in slytherin everyone thought i was slytherinsheir for a while because i can speak parseltongue you can speak parseltongue harry said dumbledore calmlybecause lord voldemort who is the last remaining ancestorof salazar slytherin can speak parseltongue unless im muchmistaken he transferred some of his own powers to you the night hegave you that scar not something he intended to do im sure voldemort put a bit of himself in me harry said thunderstruckit certainly seems soso i should be in slytherin harry said looking desperately intodumbledores face the sorting hat could see slytherins power inme and it put you in gryffindor said dumbledore calmly listen to me harryyou happen to have many qualities salazar slytherin prized in his handpickedstudents his own very rare gift parseltongue resourcefulness determination a certain disregard for rules headded his mustache quivering again yet the sorting hat placed youin gryffindor you know why that was thinkit only put me in gryffindor said harry in a defeated voice becausei asked not to go in slytherin exactly said dumbledore beaming once more which makes youvery different from tom riddle it is our choices harry that show whatwe truly are far more than our abilities harry sat motionless in hischair stunned if you want proof harry that you belong ingryffindor i suggest you look more closely at thisdumbledore reached across to professor mcgonagalls desk pickedup the bloodstained silver sword and handed it to harry dully harryturned it over the rubies blazing in the firelight and then he saw thename engraved just below the hiltgodric gryffindoronly a true gryffindor could have pulled that out of the hat harrysaid dumbledore simplyfor a minute neither of them spoke then dumbledore pulled openone of the drawers in professor mcgonagalls desk and took out a quilland a bottle of inkwhat you need harry is some food and sleep i suggest you go downto the feast while i write to azkaban we need our gamekeeperback and i must draft an advertisement for the daily prophet too headded thoughtfully well be needing a new defense against thedark arts teacher dear me we do seem to run through them dontweharry got up and crossed to the door he had just reached for thehandle however when the door burst open so violently that it bouncedback off the walllucius malfoy stood there fury in his face and cowering behind hislegs heavily wrapped in bandages was dobbygood evening lucius said dumbledore pleasantlymr malfoy almost knocked harry over as he swept into the roomdobby went scurrying in after him crouching at the hem of his cloaka look of abject terror on his facethe elf was carrying a stained rag with which he was attempting tofinish cleaning mr malfoys shoes apparently mr malfoy had set outin a great hurry for not only were his shoes halfpolished but hisusually sleek hair was disheveled ignoring the elf bobbingapologetically around his ankles he fixed his cold eyes upondumbledoreso he said youve come back the governors suspended you butyou still saw fit to return to hogwartswell you see lucius said dumbledore smiling serenely theother eleven governors contacted me today it was something likebeing caught in a hailstorm of owls to tell the truth theyd heard thatarthur weasleys daughter had been killed and wanted me back hereat once they seemed to think i was the best man for the job afterall very strange tales they told me too several of them seemedto think that you had threatened to curse their families if they didntagree to suspend me in the first placemr malfoy went even paler than usual but his eyes were still slits offuryso have you stopped the attacks yet he sneered have youcaught the culpritwe have said dumbledore with a smilewellsaid mr malfoy sharply who is itthe same person as last time lucius said dumbledore but thistime lord voldemort was acting through somebody else by meansof this diaryhe held up the small black book with the large hole through thecenter watching mr malfoy closely harry however was watchingdobbythe elf was doing something very odd his great eyes fixedmeaningfully on harry he kept pointing at the diary then at mrmalfoy and then hitting himself hard on the head with his fisti see said mr malfoy slowly to dumbledorea clever plan said dumbledore in a level voice still staring mrmalfoy straight in the eye because if harry here mr malfoy shotharry a swift sharp look and his friend ron hadnt discoveredthis book why ginny weasley might have taken allthe blame no one would ever have been able to prove she hadntacted of her own free will mr malfoy said nothing his face was suddenly masklikeand imagine dumbledore went on what might have happenedthen the weasleys are one of our most prominent purebloodfamilies imagine the effect on arthur weasley and his muggleprotection act if his own daughter was discovered attacking and killing muggleborns very fortunate the diary was discoveredand riddles memories wiped from it who knows what theconsequences might have been otherwise mr

several hogwarts feasts but never one quite likethis everybody was in their pajamas and the celebration lasted allnight harry didnt know whether the best bit was hermione runningtoward him screaming you solved it you solved it or justinhurrying over from the hufflepuff table to wring his hand andapologize endlessly for suspecting him or hagrid turning up at halfpast three cuffing harry and ron so hard on the shoulders that theywere knocked into their plates of trifle or his and rons four hundredpoints for gryffindor securing the house cup for the second yearrunning or professor mcgonagall standing up totell them all that the exams had been canceled as a school treat ohno said hermione or dumbledore announcing that unfortunatelyprofessor lockhart would be unable to return next year owing to thefact that he needed to go away and get his memory back quite a fewof the teachers joined in the cheering that greeted this newsshame said ron helping himself to a jam doughnut he wasstarting to grow on methe rest of the final term passed in a haze of blazing sunshinehogwarts was back to normal with only a few small differences defense against the dark arts classes were canceled but wevehad plenty of practice at that anyway ron told a disgruntledhermione and lucius malfoy had been sacked as a school governordraco was no longer strutting around the school as though he ownedthe place on the contrary he looked resentful and sulky on the otherhand ginny weasley was perfectly happy againtoo soon it was time for the journey home on the hogwarts expressharry ron hermione fred george and ginny got a compartment tothemselves they made the most of the last few hours in which theywere allowed to do magic before the holidays they played explodingsnap set off the very last of fred and georges filibuster fireworksand practiced disarming each other by magic harry was getting verygood at itthey were almost at kings cross when harry rememberedsomethingginny what did you see percy doing that he didnt want you to tellanyoneoh that said ginny giggling well percys got a girlfriend freddropped a stack of books on georges headwhatits that ravenclaw prefect penelope clearwater said ginnythats who he was writing to all last summer hes been meeting herall over the school in secret i walked in on them kissing in an emptyclassroom one day he was so upset when she was you know attacked you wont tease him will you she added anxiouslywouldnt dream of it said fred who was looking like his birthdayhad come earlydefinitely not said george sniggeringthe hogwarts express slowed and finally stoppedharry pulled out his quill and a bit of parchment and turned to ronand hermionethis is called a telephone number he told ron scribbling it twicetearing the parchment in two and handing it to them i told your dadhow to use a telephone last summer hell know call me at thedursleys okay i cant stand another two months with only dudleyto talk to your aunt and uncle will be proud though wont they saidhermione as they got off the train and joined the crowd throngingtoward the enchanted barrier when they hear what you did thisyearproud said harry are you crazy all those times i couldvedied and i didnt manage it theyll be furious and together they walked back through the gateway to the muggleworld chapter one owl postharry potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways for one thing he hated the summer holidays more than any other time of year for anotherhe really wanted to do his homework but was forced to do it in secretin the dead of night and he also happened to be a wizardit was nearly midnight and he was lying on his stomach in bed the blankets drawn right over his head like a tent a flashlight in one hand and a large leather bound book a history of magic by bathilda bagshot propped open against the pillow harry moved the tip of his eagle feather quill down the page frowning as he looked for something that would help him write his essay witch burning in the fourteenth century was completely pointless discussthe quill paused at the top of a likely looking paragraph harry pushed his round glasses up the bridge of his nose moved his flashlight closer to the book and readnon magic people more commonly known as muggles were particularly afraid of magic in medieval times but not very good at recognizing iton the rare occasion that they did catch a real witch or wizard burning had no effect whatsoever the witch or wizard would perform a basic flame freezing charm and then pretend to shriek with pain while enjoying a gentle tickling sensation indeed wendelin the weird enjoyed being burned so much that she allowed herself to be caught no less than fortyseven times in various disguisesharry put his quill between his teeth and reached underneath his pillow for his ink bottle and a roll of parchment slowly and very carefully he unscrewed the ink bottle dipped his quill into it and began to writepausing every now and then to listen because if any of the dursleys heard the scratching of his quill on their way to the bathroom hed probably find himself locked in the cupboard under the stairs for the rest of the summerthe dursley family of number four privet drive was the reason that harry never enjoyed his summer holidays uncle vernon aunt petunia andtheir son dudley were harrys only living relatives they were muggles and they had a very medieval attitude toward magic harrys dead parents who had been a witch and wizard themselves were never mentioned under the dursleys roof for years aunt petunia and uncle vernon had hoped that if they kept harry as downtrodden as possiblethey would be able to squash the magic out of him to their fury they had been unsuccessful these days they lived in terror of anyone finding out that harry had spent most of the last two years at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry the most they could do however was to lock away harrys spellbooks wand cauldron and broomstick at the start of the summer break and forbid him to talk to the neighborsthis separation from his spellbooks had been a real problem for harrybecause his teachers at hogwarts had given him a lot of holiday workone of the essays a particularly nasty one about shrinking potions was for harrys least favorite teacher professor snape who would be delighted to have an excuse to give harry detention for a month harry had therefore seized his chance in the first week of the holidays while uncle vernon aunt petunia and dudley had gone out into the front garden to admire uncle vernons new company car in very loud voices so that the rest of the street would notice it too harry had crept downstairs picked the lock on the cupboard under the stairs grabbed some of his books and hidden them in his bedroom as long as he didnt leave spots of ink on the sheets the dursleys need never know that he was studying magic by nightharry was particularly keen to avoid trouble with his aunt and uncle at the moment as they were already in an especially bad mood with him all because hed received a telephone call from a fellow wizard one week into the school vacationron weasley who was one of harrys best friends at hogwarts came from a whole family of wizards this meant that he knew a lot of things harry didnt but had never used a telephone before most unluckily it had been uncle vernon who had answered the callvernon dursley speakingharry who happened to be in the room at the time froze as he heard rons voice answerhello hello can you hear me i want to talk to harry potterron was yelling so loudly that uncle vernon jumped and held the receiver a foot away from his ear staring at it with an expression of mingled fury and alarmwho is this he roared in the direction of the mouthpiece who are youron weasley ron bellowed back as though he and uncle vernon were speaking from opposite ends of a football field im a friend of harrys from school uncle vernons small eyes swiveled around to harry who was rooted to the spotthere is no harry potter here he roared now holding the receiver at arms length as though frightened it might explode i dont know what school youre talking about never contact me againdont you come near my familyand he threw the receiver back onto the telephone as if dropping a poisonous spiderthe fight that had followed had been one of the worst everhow dare you give this number to people like people like you uncle vernon had roared spraying harry with spitron obviously realized that hed gotten harry into trouble because he hadnt called again harrys other best friend from hogwarts hermione granger hadnt been in touch either harry suspected that ron had warned hermione not to call which was a pity because hermione the cleverest witch in harrys year had muggle parents knew perfectly well how to use a telephone and would probably have had enough sense not to say that she went to hogwartsso harry had had no word from any of his wizarding friends for five long weeks and this summer was turning out to be almost as bad as the last one there was just one very small improvement after swearing that he wouldnt use her to send letters to any of his friends harry had been allowed to let his owl hedwig out at night uncle vernon had given in because of the racket hedwig made if she was locked in her cage all the timeharry finished writing about wendelin the weird and paused to listen again the silence in the dark house was broken only by the distantgrunting snores of his enormous cousin dudley it must be very lateharry thought his eyes were itching with tiredness perhaps hed finish this essay tomorrow nighthe replaced the top of the ink bottle pulled an old pillowcase from under his bed put the flashlight a history of magic his essay quilland ink inside it got out of bed and hid the lot under a loose floorboard under his bed then he stood up stretched and checked the time on the luminous alarm clock on his bedside tableit was one oclock in the morning harrys stomach gave a funny jolt he had been thirteen years old without realizing it for a whole houryet another unusual thing about harry was how little he looked forward to his birthdays he had never received a birthday card in his life the dursleys had completely ignored his last two birthdays and he had no reason to suppose they would remember this oneharry walked across the dark room past hedwigs large empty cage to the open window he leaned on the sill the cool night air pleasant on his face after a long time under the blankets hedwig had been absent for two nights now harry wasnt worried about her shed been gone this long before but he hoped shed be back soon she was the only living creature in this house who didnt flinch at the sight of himharry though still rather small and skinny for his age had grown a few inches over the last year his jet black hair however was just as it always had been stubbornly untidy whatever he did to it the eyes behind his glasses were bright green and on his forehead clearly visible through his hair was a thin scar shaped like a bolt of lightningof all the unusual things about harry this scar was the most extraordinary of all it was not as the dursleys had pretended for ten years a souvenir of the car crash that had killed harrys parentsbecause lily and james potter had not died in a car crash they had been murdered murdered by the most feared dark wizard for a hundred yearslord voldemort harry had escaped from the same attack with nothing more than a scar on his forehead where voldemorts curse instead of killing him had rebounded upon its originator barely alive voldemort had fledbut harry had come face to face with him at hogwarts remembering their last meeting as he stood at the dark window harry had to admit he was lucky even to have reached his thirteenth birthdayhe scanned the starry sky for a sign of hedwig perhaps soaring back to him with a dead mouse dangling from her beak expecting praisegazing absently over the rooftops it was a few seconds before harry realized what he was seeingsilhouetted against the golden moon and growing larger every momentwas a large strangely lopsided creature and it was flapping in harrys direction he stood quite still watching it sink lower and lower for a split second he hesitated his hand on the window latch wondering whether to slam it shut but then the bizarre creature soared over one of the street lamps of privet drive and harry realizing what it wasleapt asidethrough the window soared three owls two of them holding up the thirdwhich appeared to be unconscious they landed with a soft flump on harrys bed and the middle owl which was large and gray keeled right over and lay motionless there was a large package tied to its legsharry recognized the unconscious owl at once his name was errol and he belonged to the weasley family harry dashed to the bed untied thecords around errols legs took off the parcel and then carried errol to hedwigs cage errol opened one bleary eye gave a feeble hoot of thanks and began to gulp some waterharry turned back to the remaining owls one of them the large snowy female was his own hedwig she too was carrying a parcel and looked extremely pleased with herself she gave harry an affectionate nip with her beak as he removed her burden then flew across the room to join errolharry didnt recognize the third owl a handsome tawny one but he knew at once where it had come from because in addition to a third packageit was carrying a letter bearing the hogwarts crest when harry relieved this owl of its burden it ruffled its feathers importantly stretched its wings and took off through the window into the nightharry sat down on his bed and grabbed errols package ripped off the brown paper and discovered a present wrapped in gold and his first ever birthday card fingers trembling slightly he opened the envelopetwo pieces of paper fell out a letter and a newspaper clippingthe clipping had clearly come out of the wizarding newspaper the daily prophet because the people in the black and white picture were movingharry picked up the clipping smoothed it out and readministry of magic employee scoops grand prize arthur weasley head of the misuse of muggle artifacts office at the ministry of magic has won the annual daily prophet grand prize galleon drawa delighted mr weasley told the daily prophet we will be spending the gold on a summer holiday in egypt where our eldest son bill works as a curse breaker for gringotts wizarding bankthe weasley family will be spending a month in egypt returning for the start of the new school year at hogwarts which five of the weasley children currently attendharry scanned the moving photograph and a grin spread across his face as he saw all nine of the weasleys waving furiously at him standing in front of a large pyramid plump little mrs weasley tail balding mrweasley six sons and one daughter all though the black and white picture didnt show it with flaming red hair right in the middle of the picture was ron tall and gangling with his pet rat scabbers on his shoulder and his arm around his little sister ginnyharry couldnt think of anyone who deserved to win a large pile of gold more than the weasleys who were very nice and extremely poor he picked up rons letter and unfolded itdear harryhappy birthdaylook i really sorry about that telephone call i hope the muggles didnt give you a hard time i asked dad and he reckons i shouldnt have shoutedits amazing here in egypt bills taken us around all the tombs and you wouldnt believe the curses those old egyptian wizards put on them mum wouldnt let ginny come in the last one there were all these mutant skeletons in there of muggles whod broken in and grown extra heads and stuffi couldnt believe it when dad won the daily prophet draw seven hundred galleons most of its gone on this trip but theyre going to buy me a new wand for next yearharry remembered only too well the occasion when rons old wand had snapped it had happened when the car the two of them had been flying to hogwarts had crashed into a tree on the school groundswell be back about a week before term starts and well be going up to london to get my wand and our new books any chance of meeting you theredont let the muggles get you downtry and come to londonron ps percys head boy he got the letter last weekharry glanced back at the photograph percy who was in his seventh and final year at hogwarts was looking particularly smug he had pinned his head boy badge to the fez perched jauntily on top of his neat hair his horn rimmed glasses flashing in the egyptian sunharry now turned to his present and unwrapped it inside was what looked like a miniature glass spinning top there was another note from ron beneath itharry this is a pocket sneakoscope if theres someone untrustworthy around its supposed to light up and spin bill says its rubbish sold for wizard tourists and isnt reliable because it kept lighting up at dinner last night but he didnt realize fred and george had put beetles in his soupbye ron harry put the pocket sneakoscope on his bedside table where it stood quite still balanced on its point reflecting the luminous hands of his clock he looked at it happily for a few seconds then picked up the parcel hedwig had broughtinside this too there was a wrapped present a card and a letterthis time from hermionedear harryron wrote to me and told me about his phone call to your uncle vernon i do hope youre all rightim on holiday in france at the moment and i didnt know

holidayscan you make it will your aunt and uncle let you come i really hope you can if not ill see you on the hogwarts express on september firstlove from hermione ps ron says percys head boy ill bet percys really pleased ron doesnt seem too happy about it harry laughed as he put herrmones letter aside and picked up her present it was very heavy knowing hermione he was sure it would be a large book full of very difficult spells but it wasnt his heart gave a huge bound as he ripped back the paper and saw a sleek black leather case with silver words stamped across it reading broomstick servicing kitwow hermione harry whispered unzipping the case to look insidethere was a large jar of fleetwoods high finish handle polish a pair of gleaming silver tall twig clippers a tiny brass compass to clip on your broom for long journeys and a handbook of do it yourself broomcareapart from his friends the thing that harry missed most about hogwarts was quidditch the most popular sport in the magical world highly dangerous very exciting and played on broomsticks harry happened to be a very good quidditch player he had been the youngest person in a century to be picked for one of the hogwarts house teams one of harrys most prized possessions was his nimbus two thousand racing broomharry put the leather case aside and picked up his last parcel he recognized the untidy scrawl on the brown paper at once this was from hagrid the hogwarts gamekeeper he tore off the top layer of paper and glimpsed something green and leathery but before he could unwrap it properly the parcel gave a strange quiver and whatever was inside it snapped loudly as though it had jawsharry froze he knew that hagrid would never send him anything dangerous on purpose but then hagrid didnt have a normal persons view of what was dangerous hagrid had been known to befriend giant spiders buy vicious three headed dogs from men in pubs and sneak illegal dragon eggs into his cabinharry poked the parcel nervously it snapped loudly again harry reached for the lamp on his bedside table gripped it firmly in one hand and raised it over his head ready to strike then he seized the rest of the wrapping paper in his other hand and pulledand out fell a book harry just had time to register its handsome green cover emblazoned with the golden title the monster book of monsters before it flipped onto its edge and scuttled sideways along the bed like some weird crabuh oh harry mutteredthe book toppled off the bed with a loud clunk and shuffled rapidly across the room harry followed it stealthily the book was hiding in the dark space under his desk praying that the dursleys were still fast asleep harry got down on his hands and knees and reached toward itouchthe book snapped shut on his hand and then flapped past him still scuttling on its covers harry scrambled around threw himself forwardand managed to flatten it uncle vernon gave a loud sleepy grunt in the room next doorhedwig and errol watched interestedly as harry clamped the struggling book tightly in his arms hurried to his chest of drawers and pulled out a belt which he buckled tightly around it the monster book shuddered angrily but could no longer flap and snap so harry threw it down on the bed and reached for hagrids carddear harryhappy birthdaythink you might find this useful for next year wont say no more heretell you when i see you hope the muggles are treating you rightall the besthagridit struck harry as ominous that hagrid thought a biting book would come in useful but he put hagrids card up next to rons and hermiones grinning more broadly than ever now there was only the letter from hogwarts leftnoticing that it was rather thicker than usual harry slit open the envelope pulled out the first page of parchment within and readdear mr potterplease note that the new school year will begin on september the firstthe hogwarts express will leave ftom kings cross station platform nine and three quarters at eleven oclockthird years are permitted to visit the village of hogsmeade on certain weekends please give the enclosed permission form to your parent or guardian to signa list of books for next year is enclosed yours sincerelyprofessor m mcgonagall deputy headmistressharry pulled out the hogsmeade permission form and looked at it no longer grinning it would be wonderful to visit hogsmeade on weekends he knew it was an entirely wizarding village and he had never set foot there but how on earth was he going to persuade uncle vernon or aunt petunia to sign the formhe looked over at the alarm clock it was now two oclock in the morningdeciding that hed worry about the hogsmeade form when he woke up harry got back into bed and reached up to cross off another day on the chart hed made for himself counting down the days left until his return to hogwarts then he took off his glasses and lay down eyes open facing his three birthday cardsextremely unusual though he was at that moment harry potter felt just like everyone else glad for the first time in his life that it was his birthdaychapter two aunt marges big mistakeharry went down to breakfast the next morning to find the three dursleys already sitting around the kitchen table they were watching a brand new television a welcome home for the summer present for dudley who had been complaining loudly about the long walk between the fridge and the television in the living room dudley had spent most of the summer in the kitchen his piggy little eyes fixed on the screen and his five chins wobbling as he ate continuallyharry sat down between dudley and uncle vernon a large beefy man with very little neck and a lot of mustache far from wishing harry a happy birthday none of the dursleys made any sign that they had noticed harry enter the room but harry was far too used to this to care he helped himself to a piece of toast and then looked up at the reporter on the television who was halfway through a report on an escaped convictthe public is warned that black is armed and extremely dangerous a special hot line has been set up and any sighting of black should be reported immediatelyno need to tell us hes no good snorted uncle vernon staring over the top of his newspaper at the prisoner look at the state of him the filthy layabout look at his hairhe shot a nasty look sideways at harry whose untidy hair had always been a source of great annoyance to uncle vernon compared to the man on the television however whose gaunt face was surrounded by a matted elbow length tangle harry felt very well groomed indeedthe reporter had reappearedthe ministry of agriculture and fisheries will announce today hang on barked uncle vernon staring furiously at the reporter you didnt tell us where that maniacs escaped from \what use is thatlunatic could be coming up the street right nowaunt petunia who was bony and horse faced whipped around and peered intently out of the kitchen window harry knew aunt petunia would simply love to be the one to call the hot line number she was the nosiest woman in the world and spent most of her life spying on the boring law abiding neighborswhen will they learn said uncle vernon pounding the table with his large purple fist that hangings the only way to deal with these peoplevery true said aunt petunia who was still squinting into next doors runner beansuncle vernon drained his teacup glanced at his watch and added id better be off in a minute petunia marges train gets in at tenharry whose thoughts had been upstairs with the broomstick servicing kit was brought back to earth with an unpleasant bumpaunt marge he blurted out sh shes not coming here is sheaunt marge was uncle vernons sister even though she was not a blood relative of harrys whose mother had been aunt petunias sister he had been forced to call her aunt all his life aunt marge lived in the country in a house with a large garden where she bred bulldogs she didnt often stay at privet drive because she couldnt bear to leave her precious dogs but each of her visits stood out horribly vividly in harrys mindat dudleys fifth birthday party aunt margo had whacked harry around the shins with her walking stick to stop him from beating dudley at musical statues a few years later she had turned up at christmas with a computerized robot for dudley and a box of dog biscuits for harry on her last visit the year before harry started at hogwarts harry had accidentally trodden on the tail of her favorite dog ripper had chased harry out into the garden and up a tree and aunt marge had refused to call him off until past midnight the memory of this incident still brought tears of laughter to dudleys eyesmargell be here for a week uncle vernon snarled and while were on the subject he pointed a fat finger threateningly at harry we need to get a few things straight before i go and collect herdudley smirked and withdrew his gaze from the television watching harry being bullied by uncle vernon was dudleys favorite form of entertainmentfirstly growled uncle vernon youll keep a civil tongue in your head when youre talking to margeall right said harry bitterly if she does when shes talking to mesecondly said uncle vernon acting as though he had not heard harrys reply as marge doesnt know anything about your abnormality i dont want any any funny stuff while shes hereyou behave yourself got mei will if she does said harry through gritted teethand thirdly said uncle vernon his mean little eyes now slits in his great purple face weve told marge you attend st brutuss secure center for incurably criminal boyswhat harry yelledand youll be sticking to that story boy or therell be trouble spat uncle vernonharry sat there white faced and furious staring at uncle vernonhardly able to believe it aunt marge coming for a weeklong visit it was the worst birthday present the dursleys had ever given him including that pair of uncle vernons old sockswell petunia said uncle vernon getting heavily to his feet ill be off to the station then want to come along for the ride duddersno said dudley whose attention had returned to the television now that uncle vernon had finished threatening harryduddys got to make himself smart for his auntie said aunt petunia smoothing dudleys thick blond hair mummys bought him a lovely new bow tieuncle vernon clapped dudley on his porky shoulder see you in a bit then he said and he left the kitchenharry who had been sitting in a kind of horrified trance had a sudden idea abandoning his toast he got quickly to his feet and followed uncle vernon to the front dooruncle vernon was pulling on his car coatim not taking you he snarled as he turned to see harry watching himlike i wanted to come said harry coldly i want to ask you somethinguncle vernon eyed him suspiciouslythird years at hog at my school are allowed to visit the village sometimes said harryso snapped uncle vernon taking his car keys from a hook

aunt marge i go to that st whatsits st brutuss secure center for incurably criminal boys bellowed uncle vernon and harry was pleased to hear a definite note of panic in uncle vernons voiceexactly said harry looking calmly up into uncle vernons large purple face its a lot to remember ill have to make it sound convincing wont i what if i accidentally let something slipyoull get the stuffing knocked out of you wont you roared uncle vernon advancing on harry with his fist raised but harry stood his groundknocking the stuffing out of me wont make aunt marge forget what i could tell her he said grimlyuncle vernon stopped his fist still raised his face an ugly pucebut if you sign my permission form harry went on quickly i swear ill remember where im supposed to go to school and ill act like a mug like im normal and everythingharry could tell that uncle vernon was thinking it over even if his teeth were bared and a vein was throbbing in his templeright he snapped finally i shall monitor your behavior carefully during marges visit if at the end of it youve toed the line and kept to the story ill sign your ruddy formhe wheeled around pulled open the front door and slammed it so hard that one of the little panes of glass at the top fell outharry didnt return to the kitchen he went back upstairs to his bedroom if he was going to act like a real muggle hed better start now slowly and sadly he gathered up all his presents and his birthday cards and hid them under the loose floorboard with his homework then he went to hedwigs cage errol seemed to have recovered he and hedwig were both asleep heads under their wings harry sighed then poked them both awakehedwig he said gloomily youre going to have to clear off for a week go with errol ronll look after you ill write him a note explaining and dont look at me like that hedwigs large amber eyes were reproachful its not my fault its the only way ill be allowed to visit hogsmeade with ron and hermioneten minutes later errol and hedwig who had a note to ron bound to her leg soared out of the window and out of sight harry now feeling thoroughly miserable put the empty cage away inside the wardrobebut harry didnt have long to brood in next to no time aunt petunia was shrieking up the stairs for harry to come down and get ready to welcome their guestdo something about your hair aunt petunia snapped as he reached the hallharry couldnt see the point of trying to make his hair lie flat aunt marge loved criticizing him so the untidier he looked the happier she would beall too soon there was a crunch of gravel outside as uncle vernons car pulled back into the driveway then the clunk of the car doors and footsteps on the garden pathget the door aunt petunia hissed at harrya feeling of great gloom in his stomach harry pulled the door openon the threshold stood aunt marge she was very like uncle vernonlarge beefy and purple faced she even had a mustache though not as bushy as his in one hand she held an enormous suitcase and tucked under the other was an old and evil tempered bulldogwheres my dudders roared aunt marge wheres my neffy poodudley came waddling down the hall his blond hair plastered flat to his fat head a bow tie just visible under his many chins aunt marge thrust the suitcase into harrys stomach knocking the wind out of him seized dudley in a tight one armed hug and planted a large kiss on his cheekharry knew perfectly well that dudley only put up with aunt marges hugs because he was well paid for it and sure enough when they broke apartdudley had a crisp twenty pound note clutched in his fat fistpetunia shouted aunt marge striding past harry as though he was a hat stand aunt marge and aunt petunia kissed or rather aunt marge bumped her large jaw against aunt petunias bony cheekboneuncle vernon now came in smiling jovially as he shut the doortea marge he said and what will ripper takeripper can have some tea out of my saucer said aunt marge as they all proceeded into the kitchen leaving harry alone in the hall with the suitcase but harry wasnt complaining any excuse not to be with aunt marge was fine by him so he began to heave the case upstairs into the spare bedroom taking as long as he couldby the time he got back to the kitchen aunt marge had been supplied with tea and fruitcake and ripper was lapping noisily in the cornerharry saw aunt petunia

have done it myself youd have gone straight to an orphanage if youd been dumped on my doorstepharry was bursting to say that hed rather live in an orphanage than with the dursleys but the thought of the hogsmeade form stopped him he forced his face into a painful smiledont you smirk at me boomed aunt marge i can see you havent improved since i last saw you i hoped school would knock some manners into you she took a large gulp of tea wiped her mustache and saidwhere is it that you send him again vernonst brutuss said uncle vernon promptly its a first rate institution for hopeless casesi see

properly he added all the timeexcellent said aunt marge i wont have this namby pambywishy washy nonsense about not hitting people who deserve it a good thrashing is whats needed in ninety nine cases out of a hundred have you been beaten oftenoh yeah said harry loads of timesaunt marge narrowed her eyesi still dont like your tone boy she said if you can speak of your beatings in that casual way they clearly arent hitting you hard enough petunia id write if i were you make it clear that you approve the use of extreme force in this boys caseperhaps uncle vernon was worried that harry might forget their bargain in any case he changed the subject abruptlyheard the news this morning marge what about that escaped prisoner ehas aunt marge started to make herself at home harry caught himself thinking almost longingly of life at number four without her uncle vernon and aunt petunia usually encouraged harry to stay out of their way which harry was only too happy to do aunt marge on the other hand wanted harry under her eye at all times so that she could boom out suggestions for his improvement she delighted in comparing harry with dudley and took huge pleasure in buying dudley expensive presents while glaring at harry as though daring him to ask why he hadnt got a present too she also kept throwing out dark hints about what made harry such an unsatisfactory personyou mustnt blame yourself for the way the boys turned out vernon she said over lunch on the third day if theres something rotten on the inside theres nothing anyone can do about itharry tried to concentrate on his food but his hands shook and his face was starting to burn with anger remember the form he told himself think about hogsmeade dont say anything dont rise aunt marge reached for her glass of wineits one of the basic rules of breeding she said you see it all the time with dogs if theres something wrong with the bitch therell be something wrong with the pup at that moment the wineglass aunt marge was holding exploded in her hand shards of glass flew in every direction and aunt marge sputtered and blinked her great ruddy face drippingmarge squealed aunt petunia marge are you all rightnot to worry grunted aunt marge mopping her face with her napkinmust have squeezed it too hard did the same thing at colonel fubsters the other day no need to fuss petunia i have a very firm gripbut aunt petunia and uncle vernon were both looking at harry suspiciously so he decided hed better skip dessert and escape from the table as soon as he couldoutside in the hall he leaned against the wall breathing deeply it had been a long time since hed lost control and made something explode he couldnt afford to let it happen again the hogsmeade form wasnt the only thing at stake if he carried on like that hed be in trouble with the ministry of magicharry was still an underage wizard and he was forbidden by wizard law to do magic outside school his record wasnt exactly clean either only last summer hed gotten an official warning that had stated quite clearly that if the ministry got wind of any more magic in privet driveharry would face expulsion from hogwartshe heard the dursleys leaving the table and hurried upstairs out of the wayharry got through the next three days by forcing himself to think about his handbook of do it yourself broomcare whenever aunt marge started on him this worked quite well though it seemed to give him a glazed lookbecause aunt marge started voicing the opinion that he was mentally subnormalat last at long last the final evening of marges stay arrived aunt petunia cooked a fancy dinner and uncle vernon uncorked several bottles of wine they got all the way through the soup and the salmon without a single mention of harrys faults during the lemon meringue pie unclevernon bored them a with a long talk about grunnings his drill making company then aunt petunia made coffee and uncle vernon brought out a bottle of brandycan i tempt you margeaunt marge had already had quite a lot of wine her huge face was very redjust a small one then she chuckled a bit more than that and a bit more thats the ticketdudley was eating his fourth slice of pie aunt petunia was sipping coffee with her little finger sticking out harry really wanted to disappear into his bedroom but he met uncle vernons angry little eyes and knew he would have to sit it outaah said aunt marge smacking her lips and putting the empty brandy glass back down excellent nosh petunia its normally just a fry up for me of an evening with twelve dogs to look after she burped richly and patted her great tweed stomach pardon me but i do like to see a healthy sized boy she went on winking at dudley youll be a proper sized man dudders like your father yes ill have a spot more brandy vernonnow this one here she jerked her head at harry who felt his stomach clench the handbook he thought quicklythis ones got a mean runty look about him you get that with dogs i had colonel fubster drown one last year ratty little thing it was weak underbredharry was trying to remember page twelve of his book a charm to cure reluctant reversers it all comes down to blood as i was saying the other daybad blood will out now im saying nothing against your familypetunia she patted aunt petunias bony hand with her shovellike one but your sister was a bad egg they turn up in the best families then she ran off with a wastrel and heres the result right in front of usharry was staring at his plate a funny ringing in his ears grasp your broom firmly by the tail he thought but he couldnt remember what came next aunt marges voice seemed to be boring into him like one of uncle vernons drillsthis potter said aunt marge loudly seizing the brandy bottle and splashing more into her glass and over the tablecloth you never told me what he diduncle vernon and aunt petunia were looking extremely tense dudley had even looked up from his pie to gape at his parentshe didnt work said uncle vernon with half a glance at harryunemployedas i expected said aunt marge taking a huge swig of brandy and wiping her chin on her sleeve a no account good for nothing lazy scrounger who he was not said harry suddenly the table went very quiet harry was shaking all over he had never felt so angry in his lifemore brandy yelled uncle vernon who had gone very white he emptied the bottle into aunt marges glass you boy he snarled at harry go to bed go on no vernon hiccuped aunt marge holding up a hand her tiny bloodshot eyes fixed on harrys go on boy go on proud of your parents are you they go and get themselves killed in a car crash drunk i expect they didnt die in a car crash said harry who found himself on his feetthey died in a car crash you nasty little liar and left you to be a burden on their decent hardworking relatives screamed aunt marge swelling with fury you are an insolent ungrateful little but aunt marge suddenly stopped speaking for a moment it looked as though words had failed her she seemed to be swelling with inexpressible anger but the swelling didnt stop her great red face started to expand her tiny eyes bulged and her mouth stretched too tightly for speech next second several buttons had just burst from her tweed jacket and pinged off the walls she was inflating like a monstrous balloon her stomach bursting free of her tweed waistband each of her fingers blowing up like a salami marge yelled uncle vernon and aunt petunia together as aunt marges whole body began to rise off her chair toward the ceiling she was entirely round now like a vast life buoy with piggy eyes and her hands and feet stuck out weirdly as she drifted up into the air making apoplectic popping noises ripper came skidding into the room barking madlynooooooouncle vernon seized one of marges feet and tried to pull her down again but was almost lifted from the floor himself a second laterripper leapt forward and sank his teeth into uncle vernons legharry tore from the dining room before anyone could stop him heading for the cupboard under the stairs the cupboard door burst magically open as he reached it in seconds he had heaved his trunk to the front door he sprinted upstairs and threw himself under the bed wrenching up the loose floorboard and grabbed the pillowcase full of his books and birthday presents he wriggled out seized hedwigs empty cage and dashed back downstairs to his trunk just as uncle vernon burst out of the dining room his trouser leg in bloody tatterscome back in here he bellowed come back and put her rightbut a reckless rage had come over harry he kicked his trunk openpulled out his wand and pointed it at uncle vernonshe deserved it harry said breathing very fast she deserved what she got you keep away from mehe fumbled behind him for the latch on the doorim going harry said ive had enoughand in the next moment he was out in the dark quiet street heaving his heavy trunk behind him hedwigs cage under his armchapter three the knight busharry was several streets away before he collapsed onto a low wall in magnolia crescent panting from the effort of dragging his trunk he sat quite still anger still surging through him listening to the frantic thumping of his heartbut after ten minutes alone in the dark street a new emotion overtook him panic whichever way he looked at it he had never been in a worse fix he was stranded quite alone in the dark muggle world with absolutely nowhere to go and the worst of it was he had just done serious magic which meant that he was almost certainly expelled from hogwarts he had broken the decree for the restriction of underage wizardry so badly he was surprised ministry of magic representatives werent swooping down on him where he satharry shivered and looked up and down magnolia crescentwhat was going to happen to him would he be arrested or would he simply be outlawed from the wizarding world he thought of ron and hermione and his heart sank even lower harry was sure that criminal or not ron and hermione would want to help him now but they were both abroad and with hedwig gone he had no means of contacting themhe didnt have any muggle money either there was a little wizard gold in the money bag at the bottom of his trunk but the rest of the fortune his parents had left him was stored in a vault at gringotts wizarding bank in london hed never be able to drag his trunk all the way to london unlesshe looked down at his wand which he was still clutching in his hand if he was already expelled his heart was now thumping painfully fast a bit more magic couldnt hurt he had the invisibility cloak he had inherited from his father what if he bewitched the trunk to make it feather light tied it to his broomstick covered himself in the cloak and flew to london then he could get the rest of his money out of his vault and begin his life as an outcast it was a horrible prospect but he couldnt sit on this wall forever or hed find himself trying to explain to muggle police why he was out in the dead of night with a trunkful of spellbooks and a broomstickharry opened his trunk again and pushed the contents aside looking for the invisibility cloak but before he had found it he straightened up suddenly looking around him once morea funny prickling on the back of his neck had made harry feel he was being watched but the street appeared to be deserted and no lights shone from any of the large square houseshe bent over his trunk again but almost immediately stood up once more his hand clenched on his wand he had sensed rather than heard it someone or something was standing in the narrow gap between the garage and the fence behind him harry squinted at the black alleyway if only it would move then hed know whether it was just a stray cat or something elselumos harry muttered and a light appeared at the end of his wand almost dazzling him he held it high over his head and the pebble dashed walls of number two suddenly sparkled the garage door gleamed and between them harry saw quite distinctly the hulking outline of something very big with wide gleaming eyesharry stepped backward his legs hit his trunk and he tripped his wand flew out of his hand as he flung out an arm to break his fall and he landed hard in the gutter there was a deafening bang and harry threw up his hands to shield his eyes against a sudden blinding light with a yell he rolled back onto the pavement just in time a second later a gigantic pair of wheels and headlights screeched to a halt exactly where harry had just been lying they belonged as harry saw when he raised his head to a triple decker violently purple bus which had appeared out of thin air gold lettering over the windshield spelled the knight busfor a split second harry wondered if he had been knocked silly by his fall then a conductor in a purple uniform leapt out of the bus and began to speak loudly to the nightwelcome to the knight bus emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard just stick out your wand hand step on board and we can take you anywhere you want to go my name is stan shunpike and i will be your conductor this eve the conductor stopped abruptly he had just caught sight of harry who was still sitting on the ground harry snatched up his wand again and scrambled to his feet close up he saw that stan shunpike was only a few years older than he was eighteen or nineteen at most with large protruding ears and quite a few pimpleswhat were you doin down there said stan dropping his professional mannerfell over said harrychoo fall over for sniggered stani didnt do it on purpose said harry annoyed one of the knees in his jeans was torn and the hand he had thrown out to break his fall was bleeding he suddenly remembered why he had fallen over and turned around quickly to stare at the alleyway between the garage and fencethe knight buss headlamps were flooding it with light and it was emptychoo lookin at said stanthere was a big black thing said harry pointing uncertainly into the gap like a dog but massivehe looked a round at stan whose mouth was slightly open with a feeling of unease harry saw stans eyes move to the scar on harrys foreheadwoss that on your ead said stan abruptlynothing said harry quickly flattening his hair over his scar if the ministry of magic was looking for him he didnt want to make it too easy for themwoss your name stan persistedneville longbottom said harry saying the first name that came into his head so so this bus he went on quickly hoping to distract stan did you say it goes anywhereyep said stan proudly anywhere you like longs its on land cant do nuffink underwater ere he said looking suspicious again you did flag us down dincha stuck out your wand and dinchayes said harry quickly listen how much would it be to get to londoneleven sickles said stan but for fifteen you get or chocolate and for fifteen you get an ot water bottle an a toofbrush in the color of your choiceharry rummaged once more in his trunk extracted his money bag and shoved some gold into stans hand he and stan then lifted his trunk with hedwigs cage balanced on top up the steps of the busthere were no seats instead half a dozen brass bedsteads stood beside the curtained windows candles were burning in brackets beside each bed illuminating the wood paneled walls a tiny wizard in a nightcap at the rear of the bus muttered not now thanks im pickling some slugs and rolled over in his sleepyou ave this one stan whispered shoving harrys trunk under the bed right behind the driver who was sitting in an armchair in front of the steering wheel this is our driver ernie prang this is neville longbottom ern ernie prang an elderly wizard wearing very thick glasses nodded to harry who nervously flattened his bangs again and sat down on his bedtake er away ern said stan sitting down in the armchair next to erniesthere was another tremendous bang and the next moment harry found himself flat on his bed thrown backward by the speed of the knight buspulling himself up harry stared out of the dark window and saw that they were now bowling along a completely different street stan was watching harrys stunned face with great enjoymentthis is where we was before you flagged us down he said where are we ern somewhere in walesar said erniehow come the muggles dont hear the bus said harrythem said stan contemptuously don listen properly do they don look properly either never notice nuffink they donbest go wake up madam marsh stan said ern well be in abergavenny in a minutestan passed harrys bed and disappeared up a narrow wooden staircaseharry was still looking out of the window feeling increasingly nervousernie didnt seem to have mastered the use of a steering wheel the knight bus kept mounting the pavement but it didnt hit anything lines of lampposts mailboxes and trash cans jumped out of its way as it approached and back into position once it had passedstan came back downstairs followed by a faintly green witch wrapped in a traveling cloakere you go madam marsh said stan happily as ern stamped on the brake and the beds slid a foot or so toward the front of the bus madam marsh clamped a handkerchief to her mouth and tottered down the stepsstan threw her bag out after her and rammed the doors shut there was another loud bang and they were thundering down a narrow country lane trees leaping out of the wayharry wouldnt have been able to sleep even if he had been traveling on a bus that didnt keep banging loudly and jumping a hundred miles at a time his stomach churned as he fell back to wondering what was going to happen to him and whether the dursleys had managed to get aunt marge off the ceiling yetstan had unfurled a copy of the daily prophet and was now reading with his tongue between his teeth a large photograph of a sunken faced man with long matted hair blinked slowly at harry from the front page he looked strangely familiarthat man harry said forgetting his troubles for a moment he was on the muggle newsstanley turned to the front page and chuckledsirius black he said nodding course e was on the muggle newsneville where you beenhe gave a superior sort of chuckle at the blank look on harrys face removed the front page and handed it to harryyou oughta read the papers more nevilleharry held the paper up to the candlelight and readblack still at large

use to kill each other the magical community lives in fear of a massacre like that of twelve years ago when black murdered thirteen people with a single curseharry looked into the shadowed eyes of sirius black the only part of the sunken face that seemed alive harry had never met a vampire but he had seen pictures of them in his defense against the dark arts classes and black with his waxy white skin looked just like onescary lookin fing inee said stan who had been watching harry readhe murdered thirteen people said harry handing the page back to stan with one curseyep said stan in

few nights timeear about that arry potter blew up is aunt we ad im ere on the knight bus dint we ern e was tryin i to run for ithe harry had broken wizard law just like sirius black was inflating aunt marge bad enough to land him in azkaban harry didnt know anything about the wizard prison though everyone hed ever heard speak of it did so in the same fearful tone hagrid the hogwarts gamekeeper had spent two months there only last year harry wouldnt soon forget the look of terror on hagrids face when he had been told where he was going and hagrid was one of the bravest people harry knewthe knight bus rolled through the darkness scattering bushes and wastebaskets telephone booths and trees and harry lay restless and miserable on his feather bed after a while stan remembered that harry had paid for hot chocolate but poured it all over harrys pillow when the bus moved abruptly from anglesea to aberdeen one by one wizards and witches in dressing gowns and slippers descended from the upper floors to leave the bus they all looked very pleased to gofinally harry was the only passenger leftright then neville said stan clapping his hands where abouts in londondiagon alley said harryrighto said stan old tight thenbangthey were thundering along charing cross road harry sat up and watched buildings and benches squeezing themselves out of the knight buss waythe sky was getting a little lighter he would lie low for a couple of hours go to gringotts the moment it opened then set off where he didnt knowern slammed on the brakes and the knight bus skidded to a halt in front of a small and shabby looking pub the leaky cauldron behind which lay the magical entrance to diagon alleythanks harry said to ernhe jumped down the steps and helped stan lower his trunk and hedwigs cage onto the pavementwell said harry bye thenbut stan wasnt paying attention still standing in the doorway to the bus he was goggling at the shadowy entrance to the leaky cauldronthere you are harry said a voicebefore harry could turn he felt a hand on his shoulder at the same time stan shouted blimey ern come ere come ere iharry looked up at the owner of the hand on his shoulder and felt a bucketful of ice cascade into his stomach he had walked right into cornelius fudge the minister of magic himselfstan leapt onto the pavement beside themwhat didja call neville minister he said excitedlyfudge a portly little man in a long pinstriped cloak looked cold and exhaustedneville he repeated frowning this is harry potteri knew it stan shouted gleefully ern ern guess oo neville isern es arry potter i can see is scaryes said fudge testily well im very glad the knight bus picked harry up but he and i need to step inside the leaky cauldron nowfudge increased the pressure on harrys shoulder and harry found himself being steered inside the pub a stooping figure bearing a lantern appeared through the door behind the bar it was tom the wizened toothless landlordyouve got him minister said tom will you be wanting anythingbeer brandyperhaps a pot of tea said fudge who still hadnt let go of harrythere was a loud scraping and puffing from behind them and stan and ern appeared carrying harrys trunk and hedwigs cage and looking around excitedlyow come you dint tell us oo you are eh neville said stan beaming at harry while ernies owlish face peered interestedly over stans shoulderand a private parlor please tom said fudge pointedlybye harry said miserably to stan and ern as tom beckoned fudge toward the passage that led from the barbye neville called stanfudge marched harry along the narrow passage after toms lantern and then into a small parlor tom clicked his fingers a fire burst into life in the grate and he bowed himself out of the roomsit down harry said fudge indicating a chair by the fireharry sat down feeling goose bumps rising up his arms despite the glow of the fire fudge took off his pinstriped cloak and tossed it aside then hitched up the trousers of his bottle green suit and sat down opposite harryi am cornelius fudge harry the minister of magicharry already knew this of course he had seen fudge once before but as he had been wearing his fathers invisibility cloak at the timefudge wasnt to know thattom the innkeeper reappeared wearing an apron over his nightshirt and bearing a tray of tea and crumpets he placed the tray on a table between fudge and harry and left the parlor closing the door behind himwell harry said fudge pouring out tea youve had us all in a right flap i dont mind telling you running away from your aunt and uncles house like that id started to think but youre safe and thats what mattersfudge buttered himself a crumpet and pushed the plate toward harryeat harry you look dead on your feet now then you will be pleased to hear that we have dealt with the unfortunate blowing up of miss marjorie dursley two members of the accidental magic reversal department were dispatched to privet drive a few hours ago miss dursley has been punctured and her memory has been modified she has no recollection of the incident at all so thats that and no harm donefudge smiled at harry over the rim of his teacup rather like an uncle surveying a favorite nephew harry who couldnt believe his ears opened his mouth to speak couldnt think of anything to say and closed it againah youre worrying about the reaction of your aunt and uncle said fudge well i wont deny that they are extremely angry harry but they are prepared to take you back next summer as long as you stay at hogwarts for the christmas and easter holidaysharry unstuck his throati always stay at hogwarts for the christmas and easter holidays he said and i dont ever want to go back to privet drivenow now im sure youll feel differently once youve calmed down said fudge in a worried tone they are your family after all and im sure you are fond of each other er very deep downit didnt occur to harry to put fudge right he was still waiting to hear what was going to happen to him nowso all that remains said fudge now buttering himself a second crumpet is to decide where youre going to spend the last two weeks of your vacation i suggest you take a room here at the leaky cauldron and hang on blurted harry what about my punishmentfudge blinked punishmenti broke the law harry said the decree for the restriction of underage wizardryoh my dear boy were not going to punish you for a little thing like that cried fudge waving his crumpet impatiently it was an accidentwe dont send people to azkaban just for blowing up their auntsbut this didnt tally at all with harrys past dealings with the ministry of magiclast year i got an official warning just because a house elf smashed a pudding in my uncles house he told fudge frowning the ministry of magic said id be expelled from hogwarts if there was any more magic thereunless harrys eyes were deceiving him fudge was suddenly looking awkwardcircumstances change harry we have to take into account in the present climate surely you dont want to be expelledof course i dont said harrywell then whats a the fuss about laughed fudge now have a crumpet harry while i go and see if toms got a room for youfudge strode out of the parlor and harry stared after him there was something extremely odd going on why had fudge been waiting for him at the leaky cauldron if not to punish him for what hed done and now harry came to think of it surely it wasnt usual for the minister of magic himself to get involved in matters of underage magicfudge came back accompanied by tom the innkeeperroom elevens free harry said fudge i think youll be very comfortable just one thing and im sure youll understand i dont want you wandering off into muggle london all right keep to diagon alley and youre to be back here before dark each night sure youll understand tom will be keeping an eye on you for meokay said harry slowly but whydont want to lose you again do we said fudge with a hearty laughno no best we know where you are i meanfudge cleared his throat loudly and picked up his pinstriped cloakwell ill be off plenty to do you knowhave you had any luck with black yet harry askedfudges finger slipped on the silver fastenings of his cloakwhats that oh youve heard well no not yet but its only a matter of time the azkaban guards have never yet failed and they are angrier than ive ever seen themfudge shuddered slightlyso ill say good byehe held out his hand and harry shaking it had a sudden ideaer minister can i ask you somethingcertainly said fudge with a smilewell third years at hogwarts are allowed to visit hogsmeade but my aunt and uncle didnt sign the permission form dyou think you could fudge was looking uncomfortableah he said no no im very sorry harry but as im not your parent or guardian but you i re the minister of magic said harry eagerly if you gave me permissionno im sorry harry but rules are rules said fudge flatlyperhaps youll be able to visit hogsmeade next year in fact i think its best if you dont yes well ill be off enjoy your stayharryand with a last smile and shake of harrys hand fudge left the roomtom now moved forward beaming at harryif youll follow me mr potter he said ive already taken your things upharry followed tom up a handsome wooden staircase to a door with a brass number eleven on it which tom unlocked and opened for himinside was a very comfortable looking bed some highly polished oak furniture a cheerfully crackling fire and perched on top of the wardrobe hedwig harry gaspedthe snowy owl clicked her beak and fluttered down onto harrys armvery smart owl youve got there chuckled tom arrived about five minutes after you did if theres anything you need mr potter dont hesitate to askhe gave another bow and leftharry sat on his bed for a long time absentmindedly stroking hedwigthe sky outside the window was changing rapidly from deep velvety blue to cold steely gray and then slowly to pink shot with gold harry could hardly believe that hed left privet drive only a few hours agothat he wasnt expelled and that he was now facing two completely dursley free weeksits been a very weird night hedwig he yawnedand without even removing his glasses he slumped back onto his pillows and fell asleepchapter four the leaky cauldronit took harry several days to get used to his strange new freedom never before had he been able to get up whenever he wanted or eat whatever he fancied he could even go wherever he pleased as long as it was in diagon alley and as this long cobbled street was packed with the most fascinating wizarding shops in the world harry felt no desire to break his word to fudge and stray back into the muggle worldharry ate breakfast each morning in the leaky cauldron where he liked watching the other guests funny little witches from the country up for a days shopping venerable looking wizards arguing over the latest article in transfiguration today wild looking warlocks raucous dwarfs and once what looked suspiciously like a hag who ordered a plate of raw liver from behind a thick woollen balaclavaafter breakfast harry would go out into the backyard take out his wand tap the third brick from the left above the trash bit and stand back as the archway into diagon alley opened in the wallharry spent the long sunny days exploring the shops and eating under the brightly colored umbrellas outside cafes where his fellow diners were showing one another their purchases it s a lunascope old boy no more messing around with moon charts see or else discussing the case of sirius black personalty i wont let any of the children out alone until hes back in azkaban harry didnt have to do his homework under the blankets by flashlight anymore now he could sit in the bright sunshine outside florean fortescues ice cream parlor finishing all his essays with occasional help from florean fortescue himself who apart from knowing a great deal about medieval witch burnings gave harry free sundaes every half an houronce harry had refilled his money bag with gold galleons silver sickles and bronze knuts from his vault at gringotts he had to exercise a lot of self control not to spend the whole lot at once he had to keep reminding himself that he had five years to go at hogwarts and how it would feel to ask the dursleys for money for spellbooks to stop himself from buying a handsome set of solid gold gobstones a wizarding game rather like marbles in which the stones squirt a nasty smelling liquid into the other players face when they lose a point he was sorely tempted too by the perfect moving model of the galaxy in a large glass ball which would have meant he never had to take another astronomy lesson but the thing that tested harrys resolution most appeared in his favorite shop quality quidditch supplies a week after hed arrived at the leaky cauldroncurious to know what the crowd in the shop was staring at harry edged his way inside and squeezed in among the excited witches and wizards until he glimpsed a newly erected podium on which was mounted the most magnificent broom he had ever seen in his lifejust come out prototype a square jawed wizard was telling his companionits the fastest broom in the world isnt it dad squeaked a boy younger than harry who was swinging off his fathers armirish international sides just put in an order for seven of these beauties the proprietor of the shop told the crowd and theyre favorites for the world cupa large witch in front of harry moved and he was able to read the sign next to the broomthe firebolt this state of the art pacing broom sports a stream linedsuperfine handle of ash treated with a diamond hard polish and hand numbered with its own registration number each individually selected birch twig in the broomtail has been honed to aerodynamic perfection giving the firebolt unsurpassable balance and pinpoint precisionthe firebolt has an acceleration of miles an hour in ten seconds and incorporates an unbreakable braking charm price on requestprice on request harry didnt like to think how much gold the firebolt would cost he had never wanted anything as much in his whole life but he had never lost a quidditch match on his nim bus two thousand and what was the point in emptying his gringotts vault for the firebolt when he had a very good broom already harry didnt ask for the price but he returned almost every day after that just to look at the fireboltthere were however things that harry needed to buy he went to the apothecary to replenish his store of potions ingredients and as his school robes were now several inches too short in the arm and leg he visited madam malkins robes for all occasions and bought new ones most important of all he had to buy his new schoolbooks which would include those for his two new subjects care of magical creatures and divinationharry got a surprise as he looked in at the bookshop window instead of the usual display of gold embossed spellbooks the size of paving slabs there was a large iron cage behind the glass that held about a hundred copies of the monster book of monsters torn pages were flying everywhere as the books grappled with each other locked together in furious wrestling matches and snapping aggressivelyharry pulled his booklist out of his pocket and consulted it for the first time the monster book of monsters was listed as the required book for care of magical creatures now harry understood why hagrid had said it would come in useful he felt relieved he had been wondering whether hagrid wanted help with some terrifying new petas harry entered flourish and blotts the manager came hurrying toward himhogwarts he said abruptly come to get your new booksyes said harry i need get out of the way said the manager impatiently brushing harry aside he drew on a pair of very thick gloves picked up a large knobbly walking stick and proceeded toward the door of the monster books cagehang on said harry quickly ive already got one of thosehave you a look of enormous relief spread over the managers facethank heavens for that ive been bitten five times already this morning a loud ripping noise rent the air two of the monster books had seized a third and were pulling it apartstop it stop it cried the manager poking the walking stick through the bars and knocking the books apart im never stocking them again never its been bedlam i thought wed

corner devoted to fortune telling a small table was stacked with volumes such as predicting the unpredictable insulate yourself against shocks and broken balls when fortunes turn foulhere you are said the manager who had climbed a set of steps to take down a thick black bound book unfogging the future very good guide to all your basic fortune telling methods palmistry crystal balls bird entrailsbut

the manager lightly looking to see what harry was staring at youll start seeing death omens everywhere its enough to frighten anyone to death but harry continued to stare at the front cover of the book it showed a black dog large as a bear with gleaming eyes it looked oddly familiarthe manager pressed unfogging the future into harrys handsanything else he saidyes said harry tearing his eyes away from the dogs and dazedly consulting his booklist er i need intermediate transfiguration and the standard book of spells grade threeharry emerged from flourish and blotts ten minutes later with his new books under his arms and made his way back to the leaky cauldron hardly noticing where he was going and bumping into several peoplehe tramped up the stairs to his room went inside and tipped his books onto his bed somebody had been in to tidy the windows were open and sun was pouring inside harry could hear the buses rolling by in the unseen muggle street behind him and the sound of the invisible crowd below in diagon alley he caught sight of himself in the mirror over the basinit cant have been a death omen he told his reflection defiantly i was panicking when i saw that thing in magnolia crescent it was probably just a stray doghe raised his hand automatically and tried to make his hair lie flat youre fighting a losing battle there dear said his mirror in a vvheezy voiceas the days slipped by harry started looking wherever he went for a sign of ron or hermione plenty of hogwarts students were arriving in diagon alley now with the start of term so near harry met seamus finnigan and dean thomas his fellow gryffindors in quality quidditch supplies where they too were ogling the firebolt he also ran into the real neville longbottom a round faced forgetful boy outside flourish and blotts harry didnt stop to chat neville appeared to have mislaid his booklist and was being told off by his very formidable looking grandmother harry hoped she never found out that hed pretended to be neville while on the run from the ministry of magicharry woke on the last day of the holidays thinking that he would at least meet ron and hermione tomorrow on the hogwarts express he got up dressed went for a last look at the firebolt and was just wondering where hed have lunch when someone yelled his name and he turnedharry harrythey were there both of them sitting outside florean fortescues ice cream parlor ron looking incredibly freckly herone very brown both waving frantically at himfinally said ron grinning at harry as he sat down we went to the leaky cauldron but they said youd left and we went to flourish and blotts and madam malkins and i got all my school stuff last week harry explained and how come you knew im staying at the leaky cauldron dad said ron simplymr weasley who worked at the ministry of magic would of course have heard the whole story of what had happened to aunt margedid you really blow up your aunt harry said hermione in a very serious voicei didnt mean to said harry while ron roared with laughter i just lost controlits not funny ron said hermione sharply honestly im amazed harry wasnt expelledso am i admitted harry forget expelled i thought i was going to be arrested he looked at ron your dad doesnt know why fudge let me off does heprobably cause its you isnt it shrugged ron still chucklingfamous harry potter and all that id

cauldron tonight too so you can come to kings cross with us tomorrow hermiones there as wellhermione nodded beaming mum and dad dropped me off this morning with all my hogwarts thingsexcellent said harry happily so have you got all your new books and stufflook at this said ron pulling a long thin box out of a bag and opening it brand new wand fourteen inches willow containing one unicorn tail hair and weve got all our books he pointed at a large bag under his chair what about those monster books eh the assistant nearly cried when we said we wanted twowhats all that hermione harry asked pointing at not one but three bulging bags in the chair next to herwell im taking more new subjects than you arent i said hermionethose are my books for arithmancy care of magical creatures divination the study of ancient runes muggle studies what are you doing muggle studies for said ron rolling his eyes at harry youre muggle born your mum and dad are muggles you already know all about mugglesbut itll be fascinating to study them from the wizarding point of view said hermione earnestlyare you planning to eat or sleep at all this year hermione asked harry while ron sniggered hermione ignored themive still got ten galleons she said checking her purse its my birthday in september and mum and dad gave me some money to get myself an early birthday presenthow about a nice book said ron innocentlyno i dont think so said hermione composedly i really want an owli mean harrys got hedwig and youve got errol i havent said ron errols a family owl all ive got is scabbershe pulled his pet rat out of his pocket and i want to get him checked over he added placing scabbers on the table in front of them i dont think egypt agreed with himscabbers was looking thinner than usual and there was a definite droop to his whiskerstheres a magical creature shop just over there said harry who knew diagon alley very well by now you could see if theyve got anything for scabbers and hermione can get her owlso they paid for their ice cream and crossed the street to the magical menageriethere wasnt much room inside every inch of wall was hidden by cagesit was smelly and very noisy because the occupants of these cages were all squeaking squawking jabbering or hissing the witch behind the counter was already advising a wizard on the care of double ended newts so harry ron and hermione waited examining the cagesa pair of enormous purple toads sat gulping wetly and feasting on dead blowflies a gigantic tortoise with a jewel encrusted shell was glittering near the window poisonous orange snails were oozing slowly up the side of their glass tank and a fat white rabbit kept changing into a silk top hat and back again with a loud popping noise then there were cats of every color a noisy cage of ravens a basket of funny custard colored furballs that were humming loudly and on the counter a vast cage of sleek black rats that were playing some sort of skipping game using their long bald tailsthe double ended newt wizard left and ron approached the counterits my rat he told the witch he been a bit off color ever since i brought him back from egyptbang him on the counter said the witch pulling a pair of heavy black spectacles out of her pocketron lifted scabbers out of his inside pocket and placed him next to the cage of his fellow rats who stopped their skipping tricks and scuffled to the wire for a better tooklike nearly everything ron owned scabbers the rat was secondhand he had once belonged to rons brother percy and a bit battered next to the glossy rats in the cage he looked especially woebegonehm said the witch picking up scabbers how old is this ratdunno said ron quite old he used to belong to my brotherwhat powers does he have said the witch examining scabbers closelyer the truth was that scabbers had never shown the faintest trace of interesting powers the witchs eyes moved from scabberss tatteredleft ear to his front paw which had a toe missing and tutted loudlyhes been through the mill this one she saidhe was like that when percy gave him to me said ron defensivelyan ordinary common or garden rat like this cant be expected to live longer than three years or so said the witch now if you were looking for something a bit more hard wearing you might like one of these she indicated the black rats who promptly started skipping again ron muttered show offswell if you dont want a replacement you can try this rat tonicsaid the witch reaching under the counter and bringing out a small red bottleokay said ron how much ouchron buckled as something huge and orange came soaring from the top of the highest cage landed on his head and then propelled itselfspitting madly at scabbersno crookshanks no cried the witch but scabbers shot from between her hands like a bar of soap landed splay legged on the floor and then scampered for the doorscabbers ron shouted racing out of the shop after him harry followedit took them nearly ten minutes to catch scabbers who had taken refuge under a wastepaper bin outside quality quidditch supplies ron stuffed the trembling rat back into his pocket and straightened up massaging his headwhat was thatit was either a very big cat or quite a small tiger said harrywheres hermioneprobably getting her owl they made their way back up the crowded street to the magical menagerieas they reached it hermione came out but she wasnt carrying an owlher arms were clamped tightly around the enormous ginger catyou bought that monster said ron his mouth hanging openhes gorgeous isnt he said hermione glowingthat was a matter of opinion thought harry the cats ginger fur was thick and fluffy but it was definitely a bit bowlegged and its face looked grumpy and oddly squashed as though it had run headlong into a brick wall now that scabbers was out of sight however the cat was purring contentedly in hermiones armsherinione that thing nearly scalped me said ronhe didnt mean to did you crookshanks said hermioneand what about scabbers said ron pointing at the lump in his chest pocket he needs rest and relaxation hows he going to get it with that thing aroundthat reminds me you forgot your rat tonic said hermione slapping the small red bottle into rons hand and stop worrying crookshanks will be sleeping in my dormitory and scabbers in yours whats the problem poor crookshanks that witch said hed been in there for ages no one wanted himwonder why said ron sarcastically as they set off toward the leaky cauldronthey found mr weasley sitting in the bar reading the daily prophetharry he said smiling as he looked up how are youfine thanks said harry as he ron and hermione joined mr weasley with a their shoppingmr weasley put down his paper and harry saw the now familiar picture of sirius black staring up at himthey still havent caught him then he askedno said mr weasley looking extremely grave theyve pulled us all off our regular jobs at the ministry to try and find him but no luck so farwould we get a reward if we caught him asked ron itd be good to get some more money dont be ridiculous ron said mr weasley who on closer inspection looked very strained blacks not going to be caught by a thirteen year old wizard its the azkaban guards wholl get him backyou mark my wordsat that moment mrs weasley entered the bar laden with shopping bags and followed by the twins fred and george who were about to start their fifth year at hogwarts the newly elected head boy percy and the weasleys youngest child and only girl ginnyginny who had always been very taken with harry seemed even more heartily embarrassed than usual when she saw him perhaps because he had saved her life during their previous year at hogwarts she went very red and muttered hello without looking at him percy however held out his hand solemnly as though he and harry had never met and said harryhow nice to see youhello percy said harry trying not to laughi hope youre well said percy pompously shaking hands it was rather like being introduced to the mayorvery well thanks harry said fred elbowing percy out of the way and bowing deeplysimply splendid to see you old boy marvelous said george pushing fred aside and seizing harrys hand in turn absolutely spiffingpercy scowledthats enough now said mrs weasleymum said fred as though hed only just spotted her and seizing her hand too how really corking to see you i said thats enough said mrs weasley depositing her shopping in an empty chair hello harry dear i suppose youve heard our exciting news she pointed to the brand new silver badge on percys chestsecond head boy in the family she said swelling with prideand last fred muttered under his breathi dont doubt that said mrs weasley frowning suddenly i notice they havent made you two prefectswhat do we want to be prefects for said george looking revolted at the very idea itd take all the fun out of lifeginny giggledyo u want to set a better example for your sister snapped mrsweasleyginnys got other brothers to set her an example mother said percy loftily im going up to change for dinnerhe disappeared and george heaved a sighwe tried to shut him in a pyramid he told harry but mum spotted usdinner that night was a very enjoyable affair tom the innkeeper put three tables together in the parlor and the seven weasleys harry and hermione ate their way through five delicious courseshowre we getting to kings cross tomorrow dad asked fred as they dug into a sumptuous chocolate puddingthe ministrys providing a couple of cars said mr weasleyeveryone looked up at himwhy said percy curiouslyits because of you perce said george seriously and therell be little flags on the hoods with hb on themfor humongous bighead said fredeveryone except percy and mrs weasley snorted into their puddingwhy are the ministry providing cars father percy asked again in a dignified voicewell as we havent got one anymore said mr weasleyand as i work there theyre doing me a favor his voice was casual but harry couldnt help noticing that mrweasleys ears had gone red just like rons did when he was under pressuregood thing too said mrs weasley briskly do you realize how much luggage youve all got between you a nice sight youd be on the muggle underground you are all packed arent youron hasnt put all his new things in his trunk yet said percy in a long suffering voice hes dumped them on my bedyoud better go and pack properly ron because we wont have much time in the morning mrs weasley called down the table ron scowled at percyafter dinner everyone felt very full and sleepy one by one they madetheir way upstairs to their rooms to check their things for the next day ron and percy were next door to harry he had just closed and locked his own trunk when he heard angry voices through the wall and went to see what was going onthe door of number twelve was ajar and percy was shoutingit was here on the bedside table i took it off for polishing i havent touched it all right ron roared backwhats up said harrymy head boy badge is gone said percy rounding on harrysos scabberss rat tonic said ron throwing things out of his trunk to look i think i mightve left it in the bar youre not going anywhere till youve found my badge yelled percyill get scabberss stuff im packed harry said to ron and he went downstairsharry was halfway along the passage to the bar which was now very darkwhen he heard another pair of angry voices coming from the parlor a second later he recognized them as mr and mrsweasleys he hesitated not wanting them to know hed heard them arguing when the sound of his own name made him stop then move closer to the parlor doormakes no sense not to tell him mr weasley was saying heatedlyharrys got a right to know ive tried to tell fudge but he insists on treating harry like a child hes thirteen years old and arthur the truth would terrify him said mrs weasley shrilly do you really want to send harry back to school with that hanging over himfor heavens sake hes happy not knowingi dont want to make him miserable i want to put him on his guardretorted mr weasley you know what harry and ron are like wandering off by themselves theyve ended up in the forbidden forest twice but harry mustnt do that this year when i think what could have happened to him that night he ran away from home if the knight bus hadnt picked him up im prepared to bet he would have been dead before the ministry found himbut hes not dead hes fine so whats the point molly they say sirius blacks mad and maybe he is but he was clever enough to escape from azkaban and thats supposed to be impossibleits been three weeks and no ones seen hide nor hair of him and i dont care what fudge keeps telling the daily prophet were no nearer catching black than inventing self spelling wands the only thing we know for sure is what blacks after but harry will be perfectly safe at hogwartswe thought azkaban was perfectly safe if black can break out of azkaban he can break into hogwartsbut no ones really sure that blacks after harry there was a thud on wood and harry was sure mr weasley had banged his fist on the tablemolly how many times do i have to tell you they didnt report it in the press because fudge wanted it kept quiet but fudge went out to azkaban the night black escaped the guards told fudge that blacks been talking in his sleep for a while now always the same words hes at hogwarts hes at hogwarts black is deranged molly and he wants harry dead if you ask me he thinks murdering harry will bring you know who back to pow er black lost everything the night harry stopped you know who and hes had twelve years alone in azkaban to brood on thatthere was a silence harry leaned still closer to the door desperate to hear morewell arthur you must do what you think is right but youreforgetting albus dumbledore i dont think anything could hurt harry at hogwarts while dumbledores headmaster i suppose he knows about all thisof course he knows we had to ask him if he minds the azkaban guards stationing themselves around the entrances to the school grounds he wasnt happy about it but he agreednot happy why shouldnt he be happy if theyre there to catch blackdumbledore isnt fond of the azkaban guards said mr weasley heavilynor am if it comes to that but when youre dealing with a wizard like black you sometimes have to join forces with those youd rather avoidif they save harry then i will never say another word against themsaid mr weasley wearily its late molly wed better go upharry heard chairs move as quietly as he could he hurried down the passage to the bar and out of sight the parlor door opened and a few seconds later footsteps told him that mr and mrs weasley were climbing the stairsthe bottle of rat tonic was lying under the table they had sat at earlier harry waited until he heard mr and mrs weasleys bedroom door close then headed back upstairs with the bottlefred and george were crouching in the shadows on the landing heaving with laughter as they listened to percy dismantling his and rons room in search of his badgeweve got it fred whispered to harry weve been improving itthe badge now read bighead boyharry forced a laugh went to give ron the rat tonic then shut himself in his room and lay down on his bedso sirius black was after him this explained everything fudge had been lenient with him because he was so relieved to find him alive hed madeharry promise to stay in diagon alley where there were plenty of wizards to keep an eye on him and he was sending two ministry cars to take them all to the station tomorrow so that the weasleys could look after harry until he was on the trainharry lay listening to the muffled shouting next door and wondered why he didnt feel more scared sirius black had murdered thirteen people with one curse mr and mrs weasley obviously thought harry would be panic stricken if he knew the truth but harry happened to agree wholeheartedly with mrs weasley that the safest place on earth was wherever albus dumbledore happened to be didnt people always say that dumbledore was the only person lord voldemort had ever been afraid ofsurely black as voldemorts right hand man would be just as frightened of himand then there were these azkaban guards everyone kept talking aboutthey seemed to scare most people senseless and if they were stationed all around the school blacks chances of getting inside seemed very remoteno all in all the thing that bothered harry most was the fact that his chances of visiting hogsmeade now looked like zero nobody would want harry to leave the safety of the castle until black was caught in factharry suspected his every move would be carefully watched until the danger had passedhe scowled at the dark ceiling did they think he couldnt look after himself hed escaped lord voldemort three times he wasnt completely uselessunbidden the image of the beast in the shadows of magnolia crescent crossed his mind what to do when you know the worst is comingim not going to be murdered harry said out loudthats the spirit dear said his mirror sleepilychapter five the dementortom woke harry the next morning with his usual toothless grin and a cup of tea harry got dressed and was just persuading a disgruntled hedwig to get back into her cage when ron banged his way into the room pulling a sweatshirt over his head and looking irritablethe sooner we get on the train the better he said at least i can get away from percy at hogwarts now hes accusing me of dripping tea on his photo of penelope clearwater you know ron grimaced his girlfriend shes hidden her face under the frame because her nose has gone all blotchyive got something to tell you harry began but they were interrupted by fred and george who had looked in to congratulate ron on infuriating percy againthey headed down to breakfast where mr weasley was reading the front page of the daily prophet with a furrowed brow and mrs weasley was telling hermione and ginny about a love potion shed made as a young girl all three of them were rather gigglywhat were you saying ron asked harry as they sat downlater harry muttered as percy stormed inharry had no chance to speak to ron or hermione in the chaos of leaving they were too busy heaving all their trunks down the leaky cauldrons narrow staircase and piling them up near the door with hedwig and hermes percys screech owl perched on top in their cages a small wickerwork basket stood beside the heap of trunks spitting loudlyits all right crookshanks hermione cooed through the wickerworkill let you out on the trainyou wont snapped ron what about poor scabbers ehhe pointed at his chest where a large lump indicated that scabbers was curled up in his pocketmr weasley who had been outside waiting for the ministry cars stuckhis head insidetheyre here he said harry come onmr weasley marched harry across the short stretch of pavement toward the first of two old fashioned dark green cars each of which was driven by a furtive looking wizard wearing a suit of emerald velvetin you get harry said mr weasley glancing up and down the crowded streetharry got into the back of the car and was shortly joined by hermioneron and to rons disgust percythe journey to kings cross was very uneventful compared with harrys trip on the knight bus the ministry of magic cars seemed almost ordinary though harry noticed that they could slide through gaps that uncle vernons new company car certainly couldnt have managed they reached kings cross with twenty minutes to spare the ministry drivers found them trolleys unloaded their trunks touched their hats in salute to mr weasley and drove away somehow managing to jump to the head of an unmoving line at the traffic lightsmr weasley kept close to harrys elbow all the way into the stationright then he said glancing around them lets do this in pairs as there are so many of us ill go through first with harrymr weasley strolled toward the barrier between platforms nine and tenpushing harrys trolley and apparently very interested in the intercity that had just arrived at platform nine with a meaningful look at harry he leaned casually against the barrier harry imitated himin a moment they had fallen sideways through the solid metal onto platform nine and three quarters and looked up to see the hogwarts express a scarlet steam engine puffing smoke over a platform packed with witches and wizards seeing their children onto the trainpercy and ginny suddenly appeared behind harry they were panting and had apparently taken the barrier at a runah theres penelope said percy smoothing his hair and going pink again ginny caught harrys eye and they both turned away to hide their laughter as percy strode over to a girl with long curly hair walking with his chest thrown out so that she couldnt miss his shiny badgestood back to let him on they leaned out of the window and waved at mrand mrs weasley until the train turned a corner and blocked them from viewi need to talk to you in private harry muttered to ron and hermione as the train picked up speedgo away ginny said ronoh thats nice said ginny huffily and she stalked offharry ron and hermione set off down the corridor looking for an empty compartment but all were full except for the one at the very end of the trainthis had only one occupant a man sitting fast asleep next to the window harry ron and hermione checked on the threshold the hogwarts express was usually reserved for students and they had never seen an adult there before except for the witch who pushed the food cartthe stranger was wearing an extremely shabby set of wizards robes that had been darned in several places he looked ill and exhausted though quite young his light brown hair was flecked with graywho dyou reckon he is ron hissed as they sat down and slid the door shut taking the seats farthest away from the windowprofessor r j lupin whispered hermione at oncehow dyou know thatits on his case she replied pointing at the luggage rack over the mans head where there was a small battered case held together with a large quantity of neatly knotted string the name professor r j lupin was stamped across one corner in peeling letterswonder what he teaches said ron frowning at professor lupins pallid profilethats obvious whispered hermione theres only one vacancy isnt there defense against the dark artsharry ron and hermione had already had two defense against the dark arts teachers both of whom had lasted only one year there were rumors that the job was jinxedwell i hope hes up to it said ron doubtfully he looks like ongood hex would finish him off doesnt he anyway he turned to harry what were you going to tell usharry explained all about mr and mrs weasleys argument and the warning mr weasley had just given him \when hed finished ron looked thunderstruck and hermione had her hands over her mouth she finally lowered them to say sirius black escaped to come after you ohharry youll have to be really really careful dont go looking for trouble harry i dont go looking for trouble said harry nettled trouble usually finds mehow thick would harry have to be to go looking for a nutter who wants to kill him said ron shakilythey were taking the news worse than harry had expected both ron and hermione seemed to be much more frightened of black than he wasno one knows how he got out of azkaban said ron uncomfortably no ones ever done it before and he was a top security prisoner toobut theyll catch him wont they said hermione earnestly i meantheyve got all the muggles looking out for him too whats that noise said ron suddenlya faint tinny sort of whistle was coming from somewhere the looked all around the compartmentits coming from your trunk harry said ron standing up and reaching into the luggage rack a moment later he had pulled the pocket sneakoscope out from between harrys robes it was spinning very fast in the palm of rons hand and glowing brilliantlyis that a sneakoscope said hermione interestedly standing up for a better lookyeah mind you its a very cheap one ron said it went haywire just as i was tying it to errols leg to send it to harrywere you doing anything untrustworthy at the time said hermione shrewdlyno well i wasnt supposed to be using errol you know hes not really up to long journeys but how else was i supposed to get harrys present to himstick it back in the trunk harry advised as the sneakoscope whistled piercingly or itll wake him uphe nodded toward professor lupin ron stuffed the sneakoscope into a particularly horrible pair of uncle vernons old socks which deadened the sound then closed the lid of the trunk on itwe could get it checked in hogsmeade said ron sitting back downthey sell that sort of thing in dervish and banges magical instruments and stuff fred and george told medo you know much about hogsmeade asked hermione keenly ive read its the only entirely non muggle settlement in britain yeah i think it is said ron in an offhand sort of waybut thats not why i want to go i just want to get inside honey dukeswhats that said hermioneits this sweetshop said ron a dreamy look coming over his facewhere theyve got everything pepper imps they make you smoke at the mouth and great fat chocoballs full of strawberry mousse and clotted cream and really excellent sugar quills which you can suck in class and just look like youre thinking what to write next but hogsmeades a very interesting place isnt it hermione pressed on eagerly in sites of historical sorcery it says the inn was the headquarters for the goblin rebellion and the shrieking shades supposed to be the most severely haunted building in britain and massive sherbert balls that make you levitate a few inches off the ground while youre sucking them said ron who was plainly not listening to a word hermione was sayinghermione looked around at harrywont it be nice to get out of school for a bit and explore hogsmeadespect it will said harry heavily youll have to tell me when youve found outwhat dyou mean said roni cant go the dursleys didnt sign my permission form and fudge wouldnt eitherron looked horrifiedyoure not allowed to come but no way mcgonagall or someone will give you permission musclely crabbe was taller with a pudding bowl haircut and a very thick neck goyle had short bristly hair and long gorilla ish armswell look who it is said malfoy in his usual lazy drawl pulling open the compartment door potty and the weaselcrabbe and goyle chuckled trollishlyi heard your father finally got his hands on some gold this summerweasley said malfoy did your mother die of shockron stood up so quickly he knocked crookshankss basket to the floorprofessor lupin gave a snortwhos that said malfoy taking an automatic step backward as he spotted lupinnew teacher said harry who got to his feet too in case he needed to hold ron back what were you saying malfoymalfoys pale eyes narrowed he wasnt fool enough to pick a fight right under a teachers nosecmon he muttered resentfully to crabbe and goyle and they disappearedharry and ron sat down again ron massaging his knucklesim not going to take any crap from malfoy this year he said angrilyi mean it if he makes one more crack about my family im going to get hold of his head and ron made a violent gesture in midairron hissed hermione pointing at professor lupin be carefulbut professor lupin was still fast asleepthe rain thickened as the train sped yet farther north the windows were now a solid shimmering gray which graduily darkened until lanterns flickered into life all along the corridors and over the luggage racksthe train rattled the rain hammered the ind roared but stillprofessor lupin sleptwe must be nearly there said ron leaning forward to look past professor lupin at the now completely black windowthe words had hardly left him when the train started to slow downgreat said ron getting up and walking carefully past professor lupin to try and see outside im starving i want to get to the feastwe cant be there yet said hermione checking her watchso whyre we stoppingthe train was getting slower and slower as the noise of the pistons fell away the wind and rain sounded louder than ever against the windowsharry who was nearest the door got up to look into the corridor all along the carriage heads were sticking curiously out of their compartmentsthe train came to a stop with a jolt and distant thuds and bangs told them that luggage had fallen out of the racks then without warningall the lamps went out and they were plunged into total darknesswhats going on said rons voice from behind harryouch gasped hermione ron that was my footharry felt his way back to his seatdyou think weve broken downdunnothere was a squeaking sound and harry saw the dim black outline of ronwiping a patch clean on the window and peering outtheres something moving out there ron said i think people are coming aboardthe compartment door suddenly opened and someone fell painfully over harrys legssorry dyou know whats going on ouch sorryhullo neville said harry feeling around in the dark and pulling neville up by his cloakharry is that you whats happeningno idea sit down there was a loud hissing and a yelp of pain neville had tried to sit on crookshanksim going to go and ask the driver whats going on came hermiones voice harry felt her pass him heard the door

nevillequiet said a hoarse voice suddenlyprofessor lupin appeared to have woken up at last harry could hear movements in his cornernone of them spokethere was a soft crackling noise and a shivering light filled the compartment professor lupin appeared to be holding a handful of flamesthey illuminated his tired gray face but his eyes looked alert andwarystay where you are he said in the same hoarse voice and he got slowly to his feet with his handful of fire held out in front of himbut the door slid slowly open before lupin could reach itstanding in the doorway illuminated by the shivering flames in lupins hand was a cloaked figure that towered to the ceiling its face was completely hidden beneath its hood harrys eyes darted downward and what he saw made his stomach contract there was a hand protruding from the cloak and it was glistening grayish slimy looking and scabbedlike something dead that had decayed in waterbut it was visible only for a split second as though the creature beneath the cloak sensed harrys gaze the hand was suddenly withdrawn into the folds of its black cloakand then the thing beneath the hood whatever it was drew a long slowrattling breath as though it were trying to suck something more than air from its surroundingsan intense cold swept over them all harry felt his own breath catch in his chest the cold went deeper than his skin it was inside his chestit was inside his very heartharrys eyes rolled up into his head he couldnt see he was drowning in cold there was a rushing in his ears as though of water he was being dragged downward the roaring growing louder and then from far away he heard screaming terrible terrifiedpleading screams he wanted to help whoever it was he tried to move his arms but couldnt a thick white fog was swirling around him inside him harry harry are you all rightsomeone was slapping his facew whatharry opened his eyes there were lanterns above him and the floor was shaking the hogwarts express was moving again and the lights had come back on he seemed to have slid out of his seat onto the floor ron and hermione were kneeling next to him and above them he could see neville and professor lupin watching harry felt very sick when he put up his hand to push his glasses back on he felt cold sweat on his faceron and hermione heaved him back onto his seatare you okay ron asked nervouslyyeah said harry looking quickly toward the door the hooded creature had vanished what happened wheres that that thing who screamedno one screamed said ron more nervously stillharry looked around the bright compartment ginny and neville looked back at him both very palebut i heard screaming a loud snap made them all jump professor lupin was breaking an enormous slab of chocolate into pieceshere he said to harry handing him a particularly large piece eat it itll helpharry took the chocolate but didnt eat itwhat was that thing he asked lupina dementor said lupin who was now giving chocolate to everyone elseone of the dementors of azkabaneveryone stared at him professor lupin crumpled up the empty chocolate wrapper and put it in his pocketeat he repeated itll help i need to speak to the driver excuse mehe strolled past harry and disappeared into the corridorare you sure youre okay harry said hermione watching harry anxiouslyi dont get it what happened said harry wiping more sweat off his facewell that thing the dementor stood there and looked around i mean i think it did i couldnt see its face and you you i thought you were having a fit or something said ron who still looked scared you went sort of rigid and fell out of your seat and started twitching and professor lupin stepped over you and walked toward the dementorand pulled out his wand said hermione and he said none of us is hiding sirius black under our cloaks go but the dementor didnt moveso lupin muttered something and a silvery thing shot out of his wand at it and it turned around and sort of glided away it was horrible said neville in a higher voice than usual did you feel how cold it got when it came ini felt weird said ron shifting his shoulders uncomfortably like id never be cheerful againginny who was huddled in her corner looking nearly as bad as harry felt gave a small sob hermione went over and put a comforting arm around herbut didnt any of you fall off your seats said harry awkwardlyno said ron looking anxiously at harry again ginny was shaking like mad thoughharry didnt understand he felt weak and shivery as though he were recovering from a bad bout of flu he also felt the beginnings of shamewhy had he gone to pieces like that when no one else hadprofessor lupin had come back he paused as he entered looked aroundand said with a small smile i havent poisoned that chocolate you knowharry took a bite and to his great surprise felt warmth spread suddenly to the tips of his fingers and toeswell be at hogwarts in ten minutes said professor lupin are you all right harryharry didnt ask how professor lupin knew his namefine he muttered embarrassedthey didnt talk much during the remainder of the journey at long lastthe train stopped at hogsmeade station and there was a great scramble to get outside owls hooted cats meowed and nevilles pet toad croaked loudly from under his hat it was freezing on the tiny platform rain was driving down in icy sheetsfirs years this way called a familiar voice harry ron and hermione turned and saw the gigantic outline of hagrid at the other end of the platform beckoning the terrified looking new students forward for their traditional journey across the lakeall right you three hagrid yelled over the heads of the crowd they waved at him but had no chance to speak to him because the mass of people around them was shunting them away along the platform harryron and hermione followed the rest of the school along the platform and out onto a rough mud track where at least a hundred stagecoaches awaited the remaining students each pulled harry could only assume by an invisible horse because when they climbed inside and shut the doorthe coach set off all by itself bumping and swaying in processionthe coach smelled faintly of mold and straw harry felt better since the chocolate but still weak ron and hermione kept looking at him sideways as though frightened he might collapse againas the carriage trundled toward a pair of magnificent wrought irongates flanked with stone columns topped with winged boarsharry saw two more towering hooded dementors standing guard on either side a wave of cold sickness threatened to engulf him again he leaned back into the lumpy seat and closed his eyes until they had passed the gates the carriage picked up speed on the long sloping drive up to the castle hermione was leaning out of the tiny window watching the many turrets and towers draw nearer at last the carriage swayed to a haltand hermione and ron got outas harry stepped down a drawling delighted voice sounded in his earyou fainted potter is longbottorn telling the truth you actualy faintedmalfoy elbowed past hermione to block harrys way up the stone steps to the castle his face gleeful and his pale eyes glinting maliciouslyshove off malfoy said ron whose jaw was clencheddid you faint as well weasley said malfoy loudly did the scary old dementor frighten you too weasleyis there a problem said a mild voice professor lupin had just gotten out of the next carriagemalfoy gave professor lupin an insolent stare which took in the patches on his robes and the delapidated suitcase with a tiny hint of sarcasm in his voice he said oh no er professor then he smirked at crabbe and goyle and led them up the steps into the castlehermione prodded ron in the back to make him hurry and the three of them joined the crowd swarming up the steps through the giant oak front doors into the cavernous entrance hall which was lit with flaming torches and housed a magnificent marble staircase that led to the upper floorsthe door into the great hall stood open at the right harry followed the crowd toward it but had barely glimpsed the enchanted ceiling which was black and cloudy tonight when a voice called potter granger i want to see you bothharry and hermione turned around surprised professor mcgonagalltransfiguration teacher and head of gryffindor house was calling over the heads of the crowd she was a sternlooking witch who wore her hair in a tight bun her sharp eyes were framed with square spectacles harry fought his way over to her with a feeling of foreboding professor mcgonagall had a way of making him feel he must have done something wrongtheres no need to look so worried i just want a word in my officeshe told them move along there weasleyron stared as professor mcgonagall ushered harry and hermione away from the chattering crowd they accompanied her across the entrance hall up the marble staircase and along a corridoronce they were in her office a small room with a large welcoming fireprofessor mcgonagall motioned harry and hermione to sit down she settled herself behind her desk and said abruptly professor lupin sent an owl ahead to say that you were taken ill on the train potterbefore harry could reply there was a soft knock on the door and madam pomfrey the nurse came bustling inharry felt himself going red in the face it was bad enough that hed passed out or whatever he had done without everyone making all this fussim fine he said i dont need anything oh its you is it said madam pomfrey ignoring this and bending down to stare closely at him i suppose youve been doing something dangerous againit was a dementor poppy said professor mcgonagallthey exchanged a dark look and madam pomfrey clucked disapprovinglysetting dementors around a school she muttered pushing back harrys hair and feeling his forehead he wont be the last one who collapsesyes hes all clammy terrible things they are and the effect they have on people who are already delicate im not delicate said harry crosslyof course youre not said madam pomfrey absentmindedly now taking his pulsewhat does he need said professor mcgonagall crisply bed restshould he perhaps spend tonight in the hospital wingim fine said harry jumping up the thought of what draco malfoy would say if he had to go to the hospital wing was torturewell he should have some chocolate at the very least said madam pomfrey who was now trying to peer into harrys eyesive already had some said harry professor lupin gave me some he gave it to all of usdid he now said madam pomfrey approvingly so weve finally got a defense against the dark arts teacher who knows his remediesare you sure you feel all right potter professor mcgonagall said sharplyyes said harryvery well kindly wait outside while i have a quick word with miss granger about her course schedule then we can go down to the feast togetherharry went back into the corridor with madam pomfrey who left for the hospital wing muttering to herself he had to wait only a few minutes then hermione emerged looking very happy about something followed by professor mcgonagall and the three of them made their way back down the marble staircase to the great hallit was a sea of pointed black hats each of the long house tables was lined with students their faces glimmering by the light of thousands ofcandles which were floating over the tables in midair professor flitwick who was a tiny little wizard with a shock of white hair was carrying an ancient hat and a three legged stool out of the halloh said hermione softly weve missed the sortingnew students at hogwarts were sorted into houses by trying on the sorting hat which shouted out the house they were best suited to gryffindor ravenclaw hufflepuff or slytherin professor mcgonagall strode off toward her empty seat at the staff table and harry and hermione set off in the other direction as quietly as possible toward the gryffindor table people looked around at them as they passed along the back of the hall and a few of them pointed at harry had the story of his collapsing in front of the dementor traveled that fasthe and hermione sat down on either side of ron who had saved them seatswhat was all that about he muttered to harryharry started to explain in a whisper but at that moment the headmaster stood up to speak and he broke offprofessor dumbledore though very old always gave an impression of great energy he had several feet of long silver hair and beardhalf moon spectacles and an extremely crooked nose he was often described as the greatest wizard of the age but that wasnt why harry respected him you couldnt help trusting albus dumbledore and as harry watched him beaming around at the students he felt really calm for the first time since the dementor had entered the train compartmentwelcome said dumbledore the candlelight shimmering on his beardwelcome to another year at hogwarts i have a few things to say to you all and as one of them is very serious i think it best to get it out of the way before you become befuddled by our excellent feastdumbledore cleared his throat and continued as you will all be aware after their search of the hogwarts express our school is presently playing host to some of the dementors of azkaban who are here on ministry of magic businesshe paused and harry remembered what mr weasley had said about dumbledore not being happy with the dementors guarding the schoolthey are stationed at every entrance to the grounds dumbledore continued and while they are with us i must make it plain that nobody is to leave school without permission dementors are not to be fooled by tricks or disguises or even invisibility cloaks he added blandlyand harry and ron glanced at each other it is not in the nature of a dementor to understand pleading or excuses i therefore warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you i look to the prefects and our new head boy and girl to make sure that no student runs afoul of the dementors he saidpercy who was sitting a few seats down from harry puffed out his chest again and stared around impressively dumbledore paused again he looked very seriously around the hall and nobody moved or made a soundon a happier note he continued i am pleased to welcome two new teachers to our ranks this yearfirst professor lupin who has kindly consented to fill the post of defense against the dark arts teacherthere was some scattered rather unenthusiastic applause only those who had been in the compartment on the train with professor lupin clapped hard harry among them professor lupin looked particularly shabby next to all the other teachers in their best robeslook at snape ron hissed in harrys earprofessor snape the potions master was staring along the staff table at professor lupin it was common knowledge that snape anted the defense against the dark arts job but even harry who hated snape was startled at the expression twisting his thin sallow face it was beyond anger it was loathing harry knew that expression only too well it was the look snape wore every time he set eyes on harryas to our second new appointment dumbledore continued as the lukewarm applause for professor lupin died away well i am sorry to tell youthat professor kettleburn our care of magical creatures teacherretired at the end of last year in order to enjoy more time with his remaining limbs however i am delighted to say that his place will be filled by none other than rubeus hagrid who has agreed to take on this teaching job in addition to his gamekeeping dutiesharry ron and hermione stared at one another stunned then they joined in with the applause which was tumultuous at the gryffindor table in particular harry leaned forward to see hagrid who was ruby red in the face and staring down at his enormous hands his wide grin hidden in the tangle of his black beardwe shouldve known ron roared pounding the table who else would have assigned us a biting bookharry ron and hermione were the last to stop clapping and as professor dumbledore started speaking again they saw that hagrid was wiping his eyes on the tableclothwell i think thats everything of importance said dumbledore let the feast beginthe golden plates and goblets before them filled suddenly with food and drink harry suddenly ravenous helped himself to everything he could reach and began to eatit was a delicious feast the hall echoed with talk laughter and the clatter of knives and forks harry ron and hermione however were eager for it to finish so that they could talk to hagrid they knew how much being made a teacher would mean to him hagrid wasnt a fully qualified wizard he had been expelled from hogwarts in his third year for a crime he had not committed it had been harry ron and hermione who had cleared hagrids name last yearat long last when the last morsels of pumpkin tart had melted from the golden platters dumbledore gave the word that it was time for them all to go to bed and they got their chancecongratulations hagrid hermione squealed as they reached the teachers tableall down ter you three said hagrid wiping his shining face on his napkin as he looked up at them can believe it great mandumbledore came straight down to me hut after professor kettleburn said hed had enough its what i always wanted overcome with emotion he buried his face in his napkin and professor mcgonagall shooed them awayharry ron and hermione joined the gryffindors streaming up the marble staircase and very tired now along more corridors up more and more stairs to the hidden entrance to gryffindor towers large portrait of a fat lady in a pink dress asked them passwordcoming through coming through percy called from behind the crowdthe new passwords fortuna majoroh no said neville longbottom sadly he always had trouble remembering the passwordsthrough the portrait hole and across the common room the girls and boys divided toward their separate staircases harry climbed the spiral stair with no thought in his head except how glad he was to be back they reached their familiar circular dormitory with its five four poster beds and harry looking around felt he was home at lastchapter six talons and tea leaveswhen harry ron and hermione entered the great hall for breakfast the next day the first thing they saw was draco malfoy who seemed to be entertaining a large group of slytherins with a very funny story as they passed malfoy did a ridiculous impression of a swooning fit and there was a roar of laughterignore him said hermione who was right behind harry just ignore him its not worth ithey potter shrieked pansy parkinson a slytherin girl with a facelike a pug potter the dementors are coming potter wooooooooooharry dropped into a seat at the gryffindor table next to george weasleynew third year course schedules said george passing then overwhats up with you harrymalfoy said ron sitting down on georges other side and glaring over at the slytherin tablegeorge looked up in time to see malfoy pretending to faint with terror againthat little git he said calmly he wasnt so cocky last night when the dementors were down at our end of the train came runing into our compartment didnt he frednearly wet himself said fred with a contemptuous glance at malfoyi wasnt too happy myself said george theyre horrible thingsthose dementorssort of freeze your insides dont they said fredyou didnt pass out though did you said harry in a low voiceforget it harry said george bracingly dad had to go out to azkaban one time remember fred and he said it was the worst place hed ever been he came back all weak and shaking they suck the happiness out of a place dementors most of the prisoners go mad in thereanyway well see how happy malfoy looks after our first quidditch match said fred gryffindor versus slytherin first game of the season rememberthe only time harry and malfoy had faced each other in a quidditch match malfoy had definitely come off worse feeling slightly more cheerful harry helped himself to sausages and fried tomatoeshermione was examining her new scheduleooh good were starting some new subjects today she said happilyvillains are these that trespass upon my private lands come i scorn at my fall perchance draw you knaves you dogsthey watched in astonishment as the little knight tugged his sword out of its scabbard and began brandishing it violently hopping up and down in rage but the sword was too long for him a particularly wild swing made him overbalance and he landed facedown in the grassare you all right said harry moving closer to the pictureget back you scurvy braggart back you roguethe knight seized his sword again and used it to push himself back upbut the blade sank deeply into the grass and though he pulled with all his might he couldnt get it out again finally he had to flop back down onto the grass and push up his visor to mop his sweating facelisten said harry taking advantage of the knights exhaustionwere looking for the north tower you dont know the way do youa quest the knights rage seemed to vanish instantly he clanked to his feet and shouted come follow me dear friends and we shall find our goal or else shall perish bravely in the chargehe gave the sword another fruitless tug tried and failed to mount the fat pony gave up and cried on foot then good sirs and gentle ladyon onand he ran clanking loudly into the left side of the frame and out of sightthey hurried after him along the corridor following the sound of his armor every now and then they spotted him running through a picture aheadbe of stout heart the worst is yet to come yelled the knight and they saw him reappear in front of an alarmed group of women incrinolines whose picture hung on the wall of a narrow spiral staircasepuffing loudly harry ron and hermione climbed the tightly spiraling steps getting dizzier and dizzier until at last they heard the murmur of voices above them and knew they had reached the classroomfarewell cried the knight popping his head into a painting of some sinister looking monks farewell my comrades in arms if ever you have need of noble heart and steely sinew call upon sir cadoganyeah well call you muttered ron as the knight disappeared if we ever need someone mentalthey climbed the last few steps and emerged onto a tiny landing where most of the class was already assembled there were no doors off this landing but ron nudged harry and pointed at the ceiling where there was a circular trapdoor with a brass plaque on itsibyll trelawney divination teacher harry read howre we supposed to get up thereas though in answer to his question the trapdoor suddenly opened and a silvery ladder descended right at harrys feet everyone got quietafter you said ron grinning so harry climbed the ladder firsthe emerged into the strangest looking classroom he had ever seen in fact it didnt look like a classroom at all more like a cross between someones attic and an old fashioned tea shop at leasttwenty smallcircular tables were crammed inside it all surrounded by chintz armchairs and fat little poufs everything was lit with a dim crimson light the curtains at the windows were all closed and the many lamps were draped with dark red scarves it was stiflingly warm and the fire that was burning under the crowded mantelpiece was giving off a heavysickly sort of perfume as it heated a large copper kettle the shelves running around the circular walls were crammed with dusty looking feathers stubs of candles many packs of tattered playing cardscountless silvery crystal balls and a huge array of teacupsron appeared at harrys shoulder as the class assembled around them alltalking in whisperswhere is she ron saida voice came suddenly out of the shadows a soft misty sort of voicewelcome it said how nice to see you in the physical world at lastharrys immediate impression was of a large glittering insectprofessor trelawney moved into the firelight and they saw that she was very thin her large glasses magnified her eyes to several times their natural size and she was draped in a gauzy spangled shawl innumerable chains and beads hung around her spindly neck and her arms and hands were encrusted with bangles and ringssit my children sit she said and they all climbed awkwardly into armchairs or sank onto poufs harry ron and hermione sat themselves around the same round tablewelcome to divination said professor trelawney who had seated herself in a winged armchair in front of the fire my name is professor trelawney you may not have seen me before i find that descending too often into the hustle and bustle of the main school clouds my inner eyenobody said anything to this extraordinary pronouncement professor trelawney delicately rearranged her shawl and continued so you have chosen to study divination the most difficult of all magical arts i must warn you at the outset that if you do not have the sight there is very little i will be able to teach you books can take you only so far in this fieldat these words both harry and ron glanced grinning at hermione who looked startled at the news that books wouldnt be much help in this subjectmany witches and wizards talented though they are in the area of loud bangs and smells and sudden disappearings are yet unable to penetrate the veiled mysteries of the future professor trelawney went on her enormous gleaming eyes moving from face to nervous face it is a giftgranted to few you boy she said suddenly to neville who almost toppled off his pouf is your grandmother welli think so said neville tremulouslyi wouldnt be so sure if i were you dear said professor trelawneythe firelight glinting on her long emerald earrings neville gulpedprofessor trelawney continued placidly we will be covering the basic methods of divination this year the first term will be devoted to reading the tea leaves next term we shall progress to palmistry by the way my dear she shot suddenly at parvati patil beware a red haired manparvati gave a startled look at ron who was right behind her and edged her chair away from himin the second term professor trelawney went on we shall progress to the crystal ball if we have finished with fire omens that isunfortunately classes will be disrupted in february by a nasty bout of flu i myself will lose my voice and around easter one of our number will leave us forevera very tense silence followed this pronouncement but professor trelawney seemed unaware of iti wonder dear she said to lavender brown who was nearest and shrank back in her chair if you could pass me the largest silver teapotlavender looking relieved stood up took an enormous teapot from the shelf and put it down on the table in front of professor trelawneythank you my dear incidentally that thing you are dreading it will happen on friday the sixteenth of octoberlavender tremblednow i want you all to divide into pairs collect a teacup from the shelf come to me and i will fill it then sit down and drink drink until only the dregs remain swill these around the cup three times with the left hand then turn the cup upside down on its saucer wait for thelast of the tea to drain away then give your cup to your partner to read you will interpret the patterns using pages five and six of unfogging the future i shall move among you helping and instructingoh and dear she caught neville by the arm as he made to stand up after youve broken your first cup would you be so kind as to select one of the blue patterned ones im rather attached to the pinksure enough neville had no sooner reached the shelf of teacups when there was a tinkle of breaking china professor trelawney swept over to him holding a dustpan and brush and said one of the blue ones thendear if you wouldnt mind thank you when harry and ron had had their teacups filled they went back to their table and tried to drink the scalding tea quickly they swilled the dregs around as professor trelawney had instructed then drained the cups and swapped overright said ron as they both opened their books at pages five and sixwhat can you see in minea load of soggy brown stuff said harry the heavily perfumed smoke in the room was making him feel sleepy and stupidbroaden your minds my dears and allow your eyes to see past the mundane professor trelawney cried through the gloomharry tried to pull himself togetherright youve got a crooked sort of cross he consulted unfogging the future that means youre going to have trials and suffering sorry about that but theres a thing that could be the sun hang on that means great happiness so youre going to suffer but be very happyyou need your inner eye tested if you ask me said ron and they both had to stifle their laughs as professor trelawney gazed in their directionmy turn ron peered into harrys teacup his forehead wrinkled with effort theres a blob a bit like a bowler hat he said maybe youregoing to work for the ministry of magiche turned the teacup the other way upbut this way it looks more like an acorn whats that he scanned his copy of unfogging the future a windfall unexpected gold excellent you can lend me some and theres a thin here he turned the cup again that looks like an animal yeah if that was its head it looks like a hippo no a sheepprofessor trelawney whirled around as harry let out a snort of laughterlet me see that my dear she said reprovingly to ron sweeping over and snatching harrys cup from him everyone went quiet to watchprofessor trelawney was staring into the teacup rotating it counterclockwisethe falcon my dear you have a deadly enemybut everyone knows that said hermione in a loud whisper professor trelawney stared at herwell they do said hermione everybody knows about harry and you know whoharry and ron stared at her with a mixture of amazement and admirationthey had never heard hermione speak to a teacher like that beforeprofessor trelawney chose not to reply she lowered her huge eyes to harrys cup again and continued to turn itthe club an attack dear dear this is not a happy cupi thought that was a bowler hat said ron sheepishlythe skull danger in your path my deareveryone was staring transfixed at professor trelawney who gave the cup a final turn gasped and then screamedthere was another tinkle of breaking china neville had smashed his second cup professor trelawney sank into a vacant armchair her glittering hand at her heart and her eyes closedmy dear boy my poor dear boy no it is kinder not to say nodont ask mewhat is it professor said dean thomas at once everyone had got to their feet and slowly they crowded around harry and rons tablepressing close to professor trelawneys chair to get a good look at harrys cupmy dear professor trelawneys huge eyes opened dramaticallyyou have the grimthe what said harryhe could tell that he wasnt the only one who didnt understand dean thomas shrugged at him and lavender brown looked puzzled but nearly everybody else clapped their hands to their mouths in horrorthe grim my dear the grim cried professor trelawney who looked shocked that harry hadnt understood the giant spectral dog that haunts churchyards my dear boy it is an omen the worst omen of deathharrys stomach lurched that dog on the cover of death omens in flourish and blotts the dog in the shadows of magnolia crescentlavender brown clapped her hands to her mouth too everyone was looking at harry everyone except hermione who had gotten up and moved around to the back of professor trelawneys chairi dont think it looks like a grim she said flatlyprofessor trelawney surveyed hermione with mounting dislikeyoull forgive me for saying so my dear but i perceive very little aura around you very little receptivity to the resonances of thefuture seamus finnigan was tilting his head from side to sideit looks like a grim if you do this he said with his eyes almost shut but it looks more like a donkey from here he said leaning to the leftwhen youve all finished deciding whether im going to die or notsaid harry taking even himself by surprise now nobody seemed to want to look at himi think we will leave the lesson here for today said professor trelawney in her mistiest voice yes please pack away your thingssilently the class took their teacups back to professor trelawneypacked away their books and closed their bags even ron was avoiding harrys eyesuntil we meet again said professor trelawney faintly fair fortune be yours oh and dear she pointed at neville youll be late next time so mind you work extra hard to catch upharry ron and hermione descended professor trelawneys ladder and the winding stair in silence then set off for professor mcgonagalls transfiguration lesson it took them so long to find her classroom thatearly as they had left divination they were only just in timeharry chose a seat right at the back of the room feeling as though he were sitting in a very bright spotlight the rest of the class kept shooting furtive glances at him as though he were about to drop dead at any moment he hardly heard what professor mcgonagall was telling them about animagi wizards who could transform at will into animals and wasnt even watching when she transformed herself in front of their eyes into a tabby cat with spectacle markings around her eyesreally what has got into you all today said professor mcgonagallturning back into herself with a faint pop and staring around at them all not that it matters but thats the first time my transformations not got applause from a classeverybodys heads turned toward harry again but nobody spoke then hermione raised her handplease professor weve just had our first divination class and we were reading the tea leaves and ah of course said professor mcgonagall suddenly frowningthere is no need to say any more miss granger tell me which of you will be dying this yeareveryone stared at herme said harry finallyi see said professor mcgonagall fixing harry with her beady eyesthen you should know potter that sibyll trelawney has predicted the death of one student a year since she arrived at this school none of them has died yet seeing death omens is her favorite way of greeting a new class if it were not for the fact that i never speak ill of my colleagues professor mcgonagall broke off and they saw that her nostrils had gone white she went on more calmly divination is one of the most imprecise branches of magic i shall not conceal from you that i have very little patience with it true seers are very rare and professor trelawney she stopped again and then said in a very matter of fact tone you look in excellent health to me potter so you will excuse me if i dont let you off homework today i assure you that if you die you need not hand it inhermione laughed harry felt a bit better it was harder to feel scared of a lump of tea leaves away from the dim red light and befuddling perfume of professor trelawneys classroom not everyone was convincedhowever ron still looked worried and lavender whispered but what about nevilles cupwhen the transfiguration class had finished they joined the crowdthundering toward the great hall for lunchron cheer up said hermione pushing a dish of stew toward him you heard what professor mcgonagall saidron spooned stew onto his plate and picked up his fork but didnt startharry he said in a low serious voice you havent seen a great black dog anywhere have youyeah i have said harry i saw one the night i left the dursleys ron let his fork fall with a clatterprobably a stray said hermione calmlyron looked at hermione as though she had gone madhermione if harrys seen a grim thats thats bad he said my my uncle bilius saw one and and he died twenty four hours latercoincidence said hermione airily pouring herself some pumpkin juiceyou dont know what youre talking about said ron starting to get angry grims scare the living daylights out of most wizardsthere you are then said hermione in a superior tone they see the grim and die of fright the grims not an omen its the cause of deathand harrys still with us because hes not stupid enough to see one and think right well id better kick the bucket thenron mouthed wordlessly at hermione who opened her bag took out her new arithmancy book and propped it open against the juice jugi think divination seems very woolly she said searching for her page a lot of guesswork if you ask methere was nothing woolly about the grim in that cup said ron hotlyyou didnt seem quite so confident when you were telling harry it was asheep said hermione coollyprofessor trelawney said you didnt have the right aura you just dont like being bad at something for a changehe had touched a nerve hermione slammed her arithmancy book down on the table so hard that bits of meat and carrot flew everywhereif being good at divination means i have to pretend to see death omens in a lump of tea leaves im not sure ill be studying it much longerthat lesson was absolute rubbish compared with my arithmancy classshe snatched up her bag and stalked awayron frowned after herwhats she talking about he said to harry she hasnt been to an arithmancy class yetharry was pleased to get out of the castle after lunch yesterdays rain had cleared the sky was a clear pale gray and the grass was springy and damp underfoot as they set off for their first ever care of magical creatures classron and hermione werent speaking to each other harry walked beside them in silence as they went down the sloping lawns to hagrids hut on the edge of the forbidden forest it was only when he spotted three only too familiar backs ahead of them that he realized they must be having these lessons with the slytherins malfoy was talking animatedly to crabbe and goyle who were chortling harry was quite sure he knew what they were talking abouthagrid was waiting for his class at the door of his hut he stood in his moleskin overcoat with fang the boarhound at his heels looking impatient to startcmon now get a move on he called as the class approached got a real treat for yeh today great lesson comin up everyone here rightfollow mefor one nasty moment harry thought that hagrid was going to lead them into the forest harry had had enough unpleasant experiences in there to last him a lifetime however hagrid strolled off around the edge of the trees and five minutes later they found themselves outside a kind of paddock there was nothing in thereeveryone gather round the fence here he called thats it make sure yeh can see now firs thing yehll want ter do is open yer books how said the cold drawling voice of draco malfoyeh said hagridhow do we open our books malfoy repeated he took out his copy of the monster book of monsters which he had bound shut with a length of ropeother people took theirs out too some like harry had belted their book shut others had crammed them inside tight bags or clamped them together with binder clipshasn hasn anyone bin able ter open their books said hagridlooking crestfallenthe class all shook their headsyehve got ter stroke em said hagrid as though this was the most obvious thing in the world look he took hermiones copy and ripped off the spellotape that bound it the book tried to bite but hagrid ran a giant forefinger down its spineand the book shivered and then fell open and lay quiet in his handoh how silly weve all been malfoy sneered we should have stroked them why didnt we guessi i thought they were funny hagrid said uncertainly to hermioneoh tremendously funny said malfoy really witty giving us books that try and rip our hands offshut up malfoy said harry quietly hagrid was looking downcast and harry wanted hagrids first lesson to be a successrigh then said hagrid who seemed to have lost his thread so so yehve got yer books an an now yeh need the magical creaturesyeah so ill go an get em hang on he strode away from them into the forest and out of sightgod this place is going to the dogs said malfoy loudly that oaf teaching classes my fatherll have a fit when i tell him shut up malfoy harry repeatedcareful potter theres a dementor behind you oooooooh squealed lavender brown pointing toward the opposite side of the paddocktrotting toward them were a dozen of the most bizarre creatures harry had ever seen they had the bodies hind legs and tails of horses but the front legs wings and heads of what seemed to be giant eagles with cruel steel colored beaks and large brilliantly orange eyes the talons on their front legs were half a foot long and deadly lookingeach of the beasts had a thick leather collar around its neck which was attached to a long chain and the ends of all of these were held in the vast hands of hagrid who came jogging into the paddock behind the creaturesgee up there he roared shaking the chains and urging the creatures toward the fence where the class stood everyone drew back slightly as hagrid reached them and tethered the creatures to the fencehippogriffs hagrid roared happily waving a hand at them beauifularen theyharry could sort of see what hagrid meant once you got over the first shock of seeing something that was half horse half bird you started to appreciate the hippogriffs gleaming coats changing smoothly from feather to hair each of them a different color stormy gray bronzepinkish roan gleaming chestnut and inky blackso said hagrid rubbing his hands together and beaming around if yeh wan ter come a bit nearer no one seemed to want to harry ron and hermione however approached the fence cautiouslynow firs thing yeh gotta know abou hippogriffs is theyre proudsaid hagrid easily offended hippogriffs are dont never insult onecause it might be the last thing yeh domalfoy crabbe and goyle werent listening they were talking in an undertone and harry had a nasty feeling they were plotting how best to disrupt the lessonyeh always wait fer the hippogriff ter make the firs move hagrid continued its polite see yeh walk toward him and yeh bow an yeh wait if he bows back yehre allowed ter touch him if he doesn bowthen get away from him sharpish cause those talons hurtright who wants ter go firstmost of the class backed farther away in answer even harry ron and hermione had misgivings the hippogriffs were tossing their fierce heads and flexing their powerful wings they didnt seem to like being tethered like thisno one said hagrid with a pleading lookill do it said harrythere was an intake of breath from behind him and both lavender and parvati whispered oooh no harry remember your tea leavesharry ignored them he climbed over the paddock fencegood man harry roared hagrid right then lets see how yeh get on with buckbeakhe untied one of the chains pulled the gray hippogriff away from its fellows and slipped off its leather collar the class on the other side of the paddock seemed to be holding its breath malfoys eyes were narrowed maliciouslyeasy now harry said hagrid quietly yehve got eye contact now try not ter blink hippogriffs don trust yeh if yeh blink too muchharrys eyes immediately began to water but he didnt shut thernbuckbeak had turned his great sharp head and was staring at harry with one fierce orange eye thas it said hagrid thas it harry nowbowharry didnt feel much like exposing the back of his neck to buckbeakbut he did as he was told he gave a short bow and then looked upthe hippogriff was still staring haughtily at him it didnt moveah said hagrid sounding worried right back away now harryeasy does it but then to harrys enormous surprise the hippogriff suddenly bent its scaly front knees and sank into what was an unmistakable bowwell done harry said hagrid ecstatic right yeh can touch himpat his beak go onfeeling that a better reward would have been to back away harry moved slowly toward the hippogriff and reached out toward it he patted the beak several times and the hippogriff closed its eyes lazily as though enjoying itthe class broke into applause all except for malfoy crabbe and goylewho were looking deeply disappointedrigh then harry said hagrid i reckon he might let yeh ride himthis was more than harry had bargained for he was used to a broomstick but he wasnt sure a hippogriff would be quite the sameyeh climb up there jus behind the wing joint said hagrid an mind yeh don pull any of his feathers out he won like thatharry put his foot on the top of buckbeaks wing and hoisted himself onto its back buckbeak stood up harry wasnt sure where to hold on everything in front of him was covered with feathersgo on then roared hagrid slapping the hippogriffs hindquarterswithout warning twelve foot wings flapped open on either side of harryhe just had time to seize the hippogriff around the neck before he was soaring upward it was nothing like a broomstick and harry knew which one he preferred the hippogriffs wings beat uncomfortably on either side of him catching him under his legs and making him feel he was about to be thrown off the glossy feathers slipped under his fingers and he didnt dare get a stronger grip instead of the smooth action of his nimbus two thousand he now felt himself rocking backward and forward as the hindquarters of the hippogriff rose and fell with its wingsbuckbeak flew him once around the paddock and then headed back to the ground this was the bit harry had been dreading he leaned back as the smooth neck lowered feeling he was going to slip off over the beakthen felt a heavy thud as the four ill assorted feet hit the ground he just managed to hold on and push himself straight againgood work harry roared hagrid as everyone except malfoy crabbe and goyle cheered okay who else wants a goemboldened by harrys success the rest of the class climbed cautiously into the paddock hagrid untied the hippogriffs one by one and soon people were bowing nervously all over the paddock neville ran repeatedly backward from his which didnt seem to want to bend its knees ron and hermione practiced on the chestnut while harry watchedmalfoy crabbe and goyle had taken over buckbeak he had bowed to malfoy who was now patting his beak looking disdainfulthis is very easy malfoy drawled loud enough for harry to hear himi knew it must have been if potter could do it i bet youre not dangerous at all are you he said to the hippogriff are you you great ugly bruteit happened in a flash of steely talons malfoy let out a highpitched scream and next moment hagrid was wrestling buckbeak back into his collar as he strained to get at malfoy who lay curled in the grassblood blossoming over his robesim dying malfoy yelled as the class panicked im dying look at me its killed meyer not dyin said hagrid who had gone very white someone help me gotta get him outta here hermione ran to hold open the gate as hagrid lifted malfoy easily as they passed harry saw that there was a long deep gash on malfoys arm blood splattered the grass and hagrid ran with him up the slope toward the castlevery shaken the care of magical creatures class followed at a walk the slytherins were all shouting about hagridthey should fire him straight away said pansy parkinson who was in tearsit was malfoys fault snapped dean thomas crabbe and goyle flexed their muscles threateninglythey all climbed the stone steps into the deserted entrance hallim going to see if hes okay said pansy and they all watched her run up the marble staircase the slytherins still muttering about hagrid headed away in the direction of their dungeon common room harry ron and hermione proceeded upstairs to gryffindor toweryou think hell be all right said hermione nervouslycourse he will madam pomfrey can mend cuts in about a second said harry who had had far worse injuries mended magically by the nursethat was a really bad thing to happen in hagrids first class thoughwasnt it said ron looking worried trust malfoy to mess things up for himthey were among the first to reach the great hall at dinnertime hoping to see hagrid but he wasnt therethey wouldnt fire him would they said hermione anxiously not touching her steak and kidney puddingtheyd better not said ron who wasnt eating eitherharry was watching the slytherin table a large group including crabbe and goyle was huddled together deep in conversation harry was sure they were cooking up their own version of how malfoy had been injuredwell you cant say it wasnt an interesting first day back said ron gloomilythey went up to the crowded gryffindor common room after dinner and tried to do the homework professor mcgonagall had given them but all three of them kept breaking off and glancing out of the tower windowtheres a light on in hagrids window harry said suddenlyron looked at his watchif we hurried we could go down and see him its still quite earlyi dont know hermione said slowly and harry saw her glance at himim allowed to walk across the grounds he said pointedly sirius black hasnt got past the dementors yet has heso they put their things away and headed out of the portrait hole glad to meet nobody on their way to the front doors as they werent entirely sure they were supposed to be outthe grass was still wet and looked almost black in the twilight whenthey reached hagrids hut they knocked and a voice growled cminhagrid was sitting in his shirtsleeves at his scrubbed wooden table his boarhound fang had his head in hagrids lap one look told them that hagrid had been drinking a lot there was a pewter tankard almost as big as a bucket in front of him and he seemed to be having difficulty getting them into focusspect its a record he said thickly when he recognized them don reckon theyve ever had a teacher who lasted ony a day beforeyou havent been fired hagrid gasped hermionenot yet said hagrid miserably taking a huge gulp of whatever was in the tankard buts only a matter o time i nt it after malfoyhow is he said ron as they all sat

beetle black eyeshe grabbed both harry and ron and pulled them into a bone breaking hugi think youve had enough to drink hagrid said hermione firmly she took the tankard from the table and went outside to empty itat maybe shes right said hagrid letting go of harry and ron who both staggered away rubbing their ribs hagrid heaved himself out of his chair and followed hermione unsteadily outside they heard a loud splashwhats he done said harry nervously as hermione came back in with the empty tankardstuck his head in the water barrel said hermione putting the tankard awayhagrid came back his long hair and beard sopping wet wiping the water out of his eyesthats better he said shaking his head like a dog and drenching them all listen it was good of yeh ter come an see me i really hagrid stopped dead staring at harry as though hed only just realized he was therewhat dyeh think youre doin eh he roared so suddenly that they jumped a foot in the air yehre not to go wanderin around after darkharry an you two lettin himhagrid strode over to harry grabbed his arm and pulled him to the doorcmon hagrid said angrily im takin yer all back up ter schoolan don let me catch yeh walkin down ter see me after dark again im not worth thatchapter seven the boggart in the wardrobemalfoy didnt reappear in classes until late on thursday morning when the slytherins and gryffindors were halfway through double potions he swaggered into the dungeon his right arm covered in bandages and bound up in a sling acting in harrys opinion as though he were the heroic survivor of some dreadful battlehow is it draco simpered pansy parkinson does it hurt muchyeah said malfoy putting on a brave sort of grimace but harry saw him wink at crabbe and goyle when pansy had looked awaysettle down settle down said professor snape idlyharry and ron scowled at each other snape wouldnt have said settle down if theyd walked in late hed have given them detention but malfoy had always been able to get away with anything in snapes classes snape was head of slytherin house and generality favored his own students above all othersthey were making a new potion today a shrinking solution malfoy set up his cauldron right next to harry and ron so that they were preparing their ingredients on the same tablesir malfoy called sir ill need help cutting up these daisy rootsbecause of my arm weasley cut up malfoys roots for him said snape without looking upron went brick redtheres nothing wrong with your arm he hissed at malfoymalfoy smirked across the tableweasley you heard professor snape cut up these rootsron seized his knife pulled malfoys roots toward him and began to chop them roughly so that they were all different sizesprofessor drawled malfoy weasleys mutilating my roots sitsnape approached their table stared down his hooked nose at the rootsthen gave ron an unpleasant smile from beneath his long greasy black hairchange roots with malfoy weasleybut sit ron had spent the last quarter of an hour carefully shredding his own roots into exactly equal piecesnow said snape in his most dangerous voiceron shoved his own beautifully cut roots across the table a malfoythen took up the knife againand sir ill need this shrivelfig skinned said malfoy his voice full of malicious laughterpotter you can skin malfoys shrivelfig said snape giving harry the look of loathing he always reserved just for himharry took malfoys shrivelfig as ron began trying to repair the damage to the roots he now had to use harry skinned the shrivelfig as fast as he could and flung it back across the table at malfoy without speakingmalfoy was smirking more broadly than everseen your pal hagrid lately he asked them quietlynone of your business said ron jerkily without looking upim afraid he wont be a teacher much longer said malfoy in a tone of mock sorrow fathers not very happy about my injury keep talking malfoy and ill give you a real injury snarled ronhes complained to the school governors and to the ministry of magic fathers got a lot of influence you know and a lasting injury like this he gave a huge fake sigh who knows if my armll everbe the same againso thats why youre putting it on said harry accidentally beheading a dead caterpillar because his hand was shaking in anger to try to get hagrid firedwell said malfoy lowering his voice to a whisper partly potterbut there are other benefits too weasley slice my caterpillars for mea few cauldrons away neville was in trouble neville regularly went to pieces in potions lessons it was his worst subject and his great fear of professor snape made things ten times worse his potion which was supposed to be a bright acid green had turned orange longbottom said snape ladling some up and allowing to splash back into the cauldron so that everyone could seeorange tell me boy does anything penetrate that thick skull of yours didnt you hear me say quite clearly that only one tat spleen was needed didnt i state plainly that a dash of leech juice would suffice what do i have to do to make you understand longbottomneville was pink and trembling he looked as though he was on the verge of tearsplease sir said hermione please i could help neville put it right i dont remember asking you to show off miss granger said snape coldly and hermione went as pink as neville longbottom at the end of this lesson we will feed a few drops of this potion to your toad and see what happens perhaps that will encourage you to do it properlysnape moved away leaving neville breathless with fearhelp me he moaned to hermionehey harry said seamus finnigan leaning over to borrow harrys brass scales have you heard daily prophet this morning they reckonsirius blacks been sightedwhere said harry and ron quickly on the other side of the tablemalfoy looked up listening closelynot too far from here said seamus who looked excited it was a muggle who saw him course she didnt really understand the muggles think hes just an ordinary criminal dont they so she phoned the telephone hot line by the time the ministry of magic got there he was gonenot too far from here ron repeated looking significantly at harry he turned around and saw malfoy watching closely what malfoyneed something else skinnedbut malfoys eyes were shining malevolently and they were fixed harryhe leaned across the tableblack single handed potterthinking of trying to catch yeah thats right said harry offhandedlymalfoys thin mouth was curving in a mean smileof course if it was me he said quietly id have done something before now i wouldnt be staying in school like a good boy id be out there looking for himwhat are you talking about malfoy said ron roughlydont you know potter breathed malfoy his pate eyes narrowedknow whatmalfoy let out a low sneering laughmaybe youd rather not risk your neck he said want to leave it to the dementors do you but if it was me id want revenge id hunt himdown myselfwhat are you talking about said harry angrily but at that moment snape called you should have finished adding your ingredients by now this potion needs to stew before it can be drunk so clear away while it simmers and then well test longbottoms crabbe and goyle laughed openly watching neville sweat as he stirred his potion feverishly hermione was muttering instructions to him out of the corner of her mouth so that snape wouldnt see harry and ron packed away their unused ingredients and went to wash their hands and ladles in the stone basin in the cornerwhat did malfoy mean harry muttered to ron as he stuck his hands under the icy jet that poured from the gargoyles mouth why would i want revenge on black he hasnt done anything to me yethes making it up said ron savagely hes trying to make you do something stupidthe end of the lesson in sight snape strode over to neville who was cowering by his cauldroneveryone gather round said snape his black eyes glittering and watch what happens to longbottoms toad if he has managed to produce a shrinking solution it will shrink to a tadpole if as i dont doubthe has done it wrong his toad is likely to be poisonedthe gryffindors watched fearfully the slytherins looked excited snape picked up trevor the toad in his left hand and dipped a small spoon into nevilles potion which was now green he trickled a few drops down trevors throatthere was a moment of hushed silence in which trevor gulped then there was a small pop and trevor the tadpole was wriggling in snapes palmthe gryffindors burst into applause snape looking sour pulled a small bottle from the pocket of his robe poured a few drops on top of trevorand he reappeared suddenly fully grownfive points from gryffindor said snape which wiped the smiles from every face i told you not to help him miss granger class dismissedharry ron and hermione climbed the steps to the entrance hall harry was still thinking about what malfoy had said while ron was seething about snapefive points from gryffindor because the potion was all rightwhy didnt you lie hermione you shouldve said neville did it all by himselfhermione didnt answer ron looked aroundwhere is sheharry turned too they were at the top of the steps now watching the rest of the class pass them heading for the great hall and lunchshe was right behind us said ron frowningmalfoy passed them walking between crabbe and goyle he smirked at harry and disappearedthere she is said harryhermione was panting slightly hurrying up the stairs one hand clutched her bag the other seemed to be tucking something down the front of her robeshow did you do that said ronwhat said hermione joining themone minute you were right behind us the next moment you were back at the bottom of the stairs againwhat hermione looked slightly confused oh i had to go back for something oh no a seam had split on hermiones bag harry wasnt surprised he could see that it was crammed with at least a dozen large and heavy bookswhy are you carrying all these around with you ron asked heryou know how many subjects im taking said hermione breathlesslycouldnt hold these for me could youbut ron was turning over the books she had handed him looking at the covers you havent got any of these subjects today its only defense against the dark arts this afternoonoh yes said hermione vaguely but she packed all the books back into her bag just the same i hope theres something good for lunch im starving she added and she marched off toward the great halldyou get the feeling hermiones not telling us somethingron asked harryprofessor lupin wasnt there when they arrived at his first defense against the dark arts lesson they all sat down took out their booksquills and parchment and were talking when he finally entered the room lupin smiled vaguely and placed his tatty old briefcase on the teachers desk he was as shabby as ever but looked healthier than he had on the train as though he had had a few square mealsgood afternoon he said would you please put all your books back in your bags todays will be a practical lesson you will need only your wandsa few curious looks were exchanged as the class put away their booksthey had never had a practical defense against the dark arts beforeunless you counted the memorable class last year when their old teacher had brought a cageful of pixies to class and set them looseright then said professor lupin when everyone was ready if youd follow mepuzzled but interested the class got to its feet and followed professor lupin out of the classroom he led them along the deserted corridor andaround a corner where the first thing they saw was peeves the poltergeist who was floating upside down in midair and stuffing the nearest keyhole with chewing gumpeeves didnt look up until professor lupin was two feet away hen he wiggled his curly toed feet and broke into songloony loopy lupin peeves sang loony loopy lupin loony loopy lupin rude and unmanageable as he almost always was peeves usually showed some respect toward the teachers everyone looked quickly at professor lupin to see how he would take this to their surprise he was still smilingid take that gum out of the keyhole if i were you peeves he said pleasantly mr filch wont be able to get in to his broomsfilch was the hogwarts caretaker a bad tempered failed wizard who waged a constant war against the students and indeed peeves howeverpeeves paid no attention to professor lupins words except to blow a loud wet raspberryprofessor lupin gave a small sigh and took out his wandthis is a useful little spell he told the class over his shoulderplease watch closelyhe raised the wand to shoulder height said waddiwasi and pointed it at peeveswith the force of a bullet the wad of chewing gum shot out of the keyhole and straight down peevess left nostril he whirled upright and zoomed away cursingcool sit said dean thomas in amazementthank you dean said professor lupin putting his wand away againshall we proceedthey set off again the class looking at shabby professor lupin with increased respect he led them down a second corridor and stopped right outside the staffroom doorinside please said professor lupin opening it and standing backthe staffroom a long paneled room full of old mismatched chairs was empty except for one teacher professor snape was sitting in a low armchair and he looked around as the class filed in his eyes were glittering and there was a nasty sneer playing around his mouth as professor lupin came in and made to close the door behind him snape said leave it open lupin id rather not witness thishe got to his feet and strode past the class his black robes billowing behind him at the doorway he turned on his heel and said possibly no ones warned you lupin but this class contains neville longbottom i would advise you not to entrust him with anything difficult not unless miss granger is hissing instructions in his earneville went scarlet harry glared at snape it was bad enough that he bullied neville in his own classes let alone doing it in front of other teachersprofessor lupin had raised his eyebrowsi was hoping that neville would assist me with the first stage of the operation he said and i am sure he will perform it admirablynevilles face went if possible even redder snapes lip curled but he left shutting the door with a snapnow then said professor lupin beckoning the class toward the end of the room where there was nothing but an old wardrobe where the teachers kept their spare robes as professor lupin went to stand next to it the wardrobe gave a sudden wobble banging off the wallnothing to worry about said professor lupin calmly because a few people had jumped backward in alarm theres a boggart in theremost people seemed to feel that this was something to worry aboutneville gave professor lupin a look of pure terror and seamus finnigan eyed the now rattling doorknob apprehensivelyboggarts like dark enclosed spaces said professor lupin wardrobesthe gap beneath beds the cupboards under sinks ive even met one that had lodged itself in a grandfather clock this one moved in yesterday afternoon and i asked the headmaster if the staff would leave it to give my third years some practiceso the first question we must ask ourselves is what is a boggarthermione put up her handits a shape shifter she said it can take the shape of whatever it thinks will frighten us mostcouldnt have put it better myself said professor lupin and hermione glowed so the boggart sitting in the darkness within has not yet assumed a form he does not yet know what will frighten the person on the other side of the door nobody knows what a boggart looks like when he is alone but when i let him out he will immediately become whatever each of us most fearsthis means said professor lupin choosing to ignore nevilles mall sputter of terror that we have a huge advantage over the boggart before we begin have you spotted it harrytrying to answer a question with hermione next to him bobbing up and down on the balls of her feet with her hand in the air was very off putting but harry had a goer because there are so many of us it wont know what shape it should beprecisely said professor lupin and hermione put her hand downlooking a little disappointed its always best to have com pany when youre dealing with a boggart he becomes confused which should he become a headless corpse or a flesh eating slug i once saw a boggart make that very mistake tried to frighten two people at once and turned himself into half a slug not remotely frighteningthe charm that repels a boggart is simple yet it requires force of mind you see the thing that really finishes a boggart is laughterwhat you need to do is force it to assume a shape that you find amusingwe will practice the charm without wands first after me please riddikulusriddikulus said the class togethergood said professor lupin very good but that was the easy partim afraid you see the word alone is not enough and this is where you come in nevillethe wardrobe shook again though not as much as neville who walked forward as though he were heading for the gallowsright neville said professor lupin first things first what would you say is the thing that frightens you most in the worldnevilles lips moved but no noise came outdidnt catch that neville sorry said professor lupin cheerfullyneville looked around rather wildly as though begging someone to help him then said in barely more than a whisper professor snapenearly everyone laughed even neville grinned apologetically professor lupin however looked thoughtfulprofessor snape hmmm neville i believe you live with your grandmotherer yes said neville nervously but i dont want the boggart to turn into her eitherno no you misunderstand me said professor lupin now smiling i wonder could you tell us what sort of clothes your grandmother usually wearsneville looked startled but said well always the same hat a tall one with a stuffed vulture on top and a long dress greennormally and sometimes a fox fur scarfand a handbag prompted professor lupina big red one said nevilleright then said professor lupin can you picture those clothes very clearly neville can you see them in your minds eyeyes said neville uncertainty plainly wondering what was coming nextwhen the boggart bursts out of this wardrobe neville and sees you it will assume the form of professor snape said lupin and you will raise your wand thus and cry riddikulus and concentrate hard on your grandmothers clothes if all goes well professor boggart snape will be forced into that vulture topped hat and that green dress with that big red handbagthere was a great shout of laughter the wardrobe wobbled more violentlyif neville is successful the boggart is likely to shift his attention to each of us in turn said professor lupin i would like all of you to take a moment now to think of the thing that scares you most and imagine how you might force it to look comicalthe room went quiet harry thought what scared him most in the worldhis first thought was lord voldemort a voldemort returned to full strength but before he had even started to plan a possible counterattack on a boggart voldemort a horrible image came floating to the surface of his minda rotting glistening hand slithering back beneath a black cloak a long rattling breath from an unseen mouth then a cold so penetrating it felt like drowningharry shivered then looked around hoping no one had noticed many people had their eyes shut tight ron was muttering to himself take its legs off harry was sure he knew what that was about rons greatest fear was spiderseveryone ready said professor lupinharry felt a lurch of fear he wasnt ready how could you make a dementor less frightening but he didnt want to ask for more time everyone else was nodding and rolling up their sleevesneville were going to back away said professor lupin let you have a clear field all right ill call the next person forward everyone back now so neville can get a clear shot they all retreated backed against the walls leaving neville alone beside the wardrobe he looked pale and frightened but he had pushed up the sleeves of his robes and was holding his wand readyon the count of three neville said professor lupin who was pointing his own wand at the handle of the wardrobe one two three nowa jet of sparks shot from the end of professor lupins wand and hit the doorknob the wardrobe burst open hook nosed and menacing professor snape stepped out his eyes flashing at nevilleneville backed away his wand up mouthing wordlessly snape was bearing down upon him reaching inside his robesr r riddikulus squeaked nevillethere was a noise like a whip crack snape stumbled he was wearing a long lace trimmed dress and a towering hat topped with a moth eaten vulture and he was swinging a huge crimson handbagthere was a roar of laughter the boggart paused confused and professor lupin shouted parvati forwardparvati walked forward her face set snape rounded on her there was another crack and where he had stood was a bloodstained bandaged mummy its sightless face was turned to parvati and it began to walk toward her very slowly dragging its feet its stiff arms rising riddikulus cried parvatia bandage unraveled at the mummys feet it became entangled fell face forward and its head rolled offseamus roared professor lupinseamus darted past parvaticrack where the mummy had been was a woman with floorlength black hair and a skeletal green tinged face a banshee she opened her mouth wide and an unearthly sound filled the room a long wailing shriek that made the hair on harrys head stand on end riddikulus shouted seamusthe banshee made a rasping noise and clutched her throat her voice was gonecrack the banshee turned into a rat which chased its tail in a circlethen crack became a rattlesnake which slithered and writhed before crack becoming a single bloody eyeballits confused shouted lupin were getting there deandean hurried forwardcrack the eyeball became a severed hand which flipped over and began to creep along the floor like a crabriddikulus yelled deanthere was a snap and the hand was trapped in a mousetrapexcellent ron you nextron leapt forwardcrackquite a few people screamed a giant spider six feet tall and covered in hair was advancing on ron clicking its pincers menacingly for a moment harry thought ron had frozen then riddikulus bellowed ron and the spiders legs vanished it rolled over and over lavender brown squealed and ran out of its way and it came to a halt at harrys feet he raised his wand ready but here shouted professor lupin suddenly hurrying forward crackthe legless spider had vanished for a second everyone looked wildly around to see where it was then they saw a silvery white orb hanging in the air in front of lupin who said riddikulus almosi lazilycrackforward neville and finish him off said lupin as the boggart landed on the floor as a cockroach crack snape was back this time neville charged forward looking determinedriddikulus he shouted and they had a split seconds view of snape in his lacy dress before neville let out a great ha of laughter and the boggart exploded burst into a thousand tiny wisps of smoke and was goneexcellent cried professor lupin as the class broke into applauseexcellent neville well done everyone let me see five points to gryffindor for every person to tackle the boggart ten for neville because he did it twice and five each to hermione and harrybut i didnt do anything said harryyou and hermione answered my questions correctly at the start of the class harry lupin said lightly very well everyone an excellent lesson homework kindly read the chapter on boggarts and summarize it for me to be handed in on monday that will be alltalking excitedly the class left the staffroom harry however wasnt feeling cheerful professor lupin had deliberately stopped him from tackling the boggart why was it because hed seen harry collapse on the train and thought he wasnt up to much had he thought harry would pass out againbut no one else seemed to have noticed anythingdid you see me take that banshee shouted seamus and the hand said dean waving his own aroundand snape in that hat and my mummyi wonder why professor lupins frightened of crystal balls said lavender thoughtfullythat was the best defense against the dark arts lesson weve ever hadwasnt it said ron excitedly as they made their way back to the classroom to get their bagshe seems like a very good teacher said hermione approvingly but i wish i could have had a turn with the boggart what would it have been for you said ron sniggering a piece of homework that only got nine out of tenchapter eight flight of the fat fadyin no time at all defense against the dark arts had become most peoples favorite class only draco malfoy and his gang of slytherins had anything bad to say about professor lupinlook at the state of his robes malfoy would say in a loud whisper as professor lupin passed he dresses like our old houseelf but no one else cared that professor lupins robes were patched and frayed his next few lessons were just as interesting as the firstafter boggarts they studied red caps nasty little goblin like creatures that lurked wherever there had been bloodshed in the dungeons of castles and the potholes of deserted battlefields waiting to bludgeon those who had gotten lost from red caps they moved on to kappas creepy water dwellers that looked like scaly monkeys with webbed hands itching to strangle unwitting waders in their pondsharry only wished he was as happy with some of his other classes worst of all was potions snape was in a particularly vindictive mood these days and no one was in any doubt why the story of the boggart assuming snapes shape and the way that neville had dressed it in his grandmothers clothes had traveled through the school like wildfiresnape didnt seem to find it funny his eyes flashed menacingly at the very mention of professor lupins name and he was bullying neville worse than everharry was also growing to dread the hours he spent in professor trelawneys stifling tower room deciphering lopsided shapes and symbols trying to ignore the way professor trelawneys enormous eyes filled with tears every time she looked at him he couldnt like professer trelawney even though she was treated with respect bordering on reverence by many of the class parvati patil and lavender brown had taken to haunting professor trelawneys tower room at lunch times and always returned with annoyingly superior looks on their faces as though they knew things the others didnt they had also started using hushed voices whenever they spoke to harry as though he were on his deathbednobody really liked care of magical creatures which after the action packed first class had become extremely dull hagrid seemed to have lost his confidence they were now spending lesson after lesson learning how to look after flobberworms which had to be some of the most boring creatures in existencewhy would anyone bother looking after them said ron after yet another hour of poking shredded lettuce down the flobberworms throatsat the start of october however harry had something else to occupy him something so enjoyable it more than made up for his unsatisfactory classes the quidditch season was approaching and oiver wood captain of the gryffindor team called a meeting on thursday evening to discusstactics for the new seasonthere were seven people on a quidditch team three chasers whose job it was to score goals by putting the quaffle a red soccer sized ball through one of the fifty foot high hoops at each end of the field two beaters who were equipped with heavy bats to repel the bludgers two heavy black balls that zoomed around trying to attack the players a keeper who defended the goal posts and the seeker who had the hardest job of all that of catching the golden snitch a tiny winged walnut sized ball whose capture ended the game and earned the seekers team an extra one hundred and fifty pointsoliver wood was a burly seventeen year old now in his seventh and final year at hogwarts there was a quiet sort of desperation in his voice as he addressed his six fellow team members in the chilly locker rooms on the edge of the darkening quidditch fieldthis is our last chance my last chance to win the quidditch cuphe told them striding up and down in front of them ill be leaving at the end of this year ill never get another shot at itgryffindor hasnt won for seven years now okay so weve had the worst luck in the world injuries then the tournamentgetting called off last year wood swallowed as though the memory still brought a lump to his throat but we also know weve got the best ruddy team in the school he said punching a fist into his other hand the old manic glint back in his eye weve got three superb chaserswood pointed at alicia spinner angelina johnson and katie bellweve got two unbeatable beatersstop it oliver youre embarrassing us said fred and george weasley together pretending to blushand weve got a seeker who has never failed to win us a match woodrumbled glaring at harry with a kind of furious pride and me he added as an afterthoughtwe think youre very good too oliver said georgespanking good keeper said fredthe point is wood went on resuming his pacing the quidditch cup should have had our name on it these last two years ever since harry joined the team ive thought the thing was in the bag but we havent got it and this years the last chance well get to finally see our name on the thingwood spoke so dejectedly that even fred and george looked sympatheticoliver this years our year said fredwell do it oliver said angelinadefinitely said harryfull of determination the team started training sessions three evenings a week the weather was getting colder and wetter the nights darker but no amount of mud wind or rain could tarnish harrys wonderful vision of finally winning the huge silver quidditch cupharry returned to the gryffindor common room one evening after trainingcold and stiff but pleased with the way practice had gone to find the room buzzing excitedlywhats happened he asked ron and hermione who were sitting in two of the best chairs by the fireside and completing some star charts for astronomyfirst hogsmeade weekend said ron pointing at a notice that had appeared on the battered old bulletin board end of octoberhalloweenexcellent said fred who had followed harry through the portrait hole i need to visit zonkos im nearly out of stink pelletsharry threw himself into a chair beside ron his high spirits ebbing away hermione seemed to read his mindharry im sure youll be able to go next time she said theyre bound to catch black soon hes been sighted once alreadyblacks not fool enough to try anything in hogsmeade said ron ask mcgonagall if you can go this time harry the next one might not be for ages ron said hermione harrys supposed to stay in school he cant be the only third year left behind said ron ask mcgonagall go on harry yeah i think i will said harry making up his mindhermione opened her mouth to argue but at that moment crookshanks leapt lightly onto her lap a large dead spider was dangling from his mouthdoes he have to eat that in front of us said ron scowlingclever crookshanks did you catch that all by yourself said hermionecrookshanks slowly chewed up the spider his yellow eyes fixed insolently on ronjust keep him over there thats all said ron irritably turning back to his star chart ve got scabbers asleep in my bagharry yawned he really wanted to go to bed but he still had his own star chart to complete he pulled his bag toward him took out parchment ink and quill and started workyou can copy mine if you like said ron labeling his last star with a flourish and shoving the chart toward harryhermione who disapproved of copying pursed her lips but didnt say anything crookshanks was still staring unblinkingly at ron flickingthe end of his bushy tail then without warning he pouncedoy ron roared seizing his bag as crookshanks sank four sets of claws deep inside it and began tearing ferociously get off you stupid animalron tried to pull the bag away from crookshanks but crookshanks clung on spitting and slashingron dont hurt him squealed hermione the whole common room was watching ron whirled the bag around crookshanks still clinging to itand scabbers came flying out of the top catch that car ron yelled as crookshanks freed himself from the remnants of the bag sprang over the table and chased after the terrified scabbersgeorge weasley made a lunge for crookshanks but missed scabbers streaked through twenty pairs of legs and shot beneath an old chest of drawers crookshanks skidded to a halt crouched low on his bandy legsand started making furious swipes beneath it with his front pawron and hermione hurried over hermione grabbed crookshanks around the middle and heaved him away ron threw himself onto his stomach and with great difficulty pulled scabbers out by the taillook at him he said furiously to hermione dangling scabbers in front of her hes skin and bone you keep that cat away from himcrookshanks doesnt understand its wrong said hermione her voice shaking all cats chase rats rontheres something funny about that animal said ron who was trying to persuade a frantically wiggling scabbers back into his pocket it heard me say that scabbers was in my bagoh what rubbish said hermione impatiently crookshanks could smell him ron how else dyou think that cats got it in for scabbers said ron ignoring the peoplearound him who were starting to giggle and scabbers was here firstand hes illron marched through the common room and out of sight up the stairs to the boys dormitoriesron was still in a bad mood with hermione next day he barely talked to her all through herbology even though he harry and hermione were working together on the same puffapodhows scabbers hermione asked timidly as they stripped fat pink pods from the plants and emptied the shining beans into a wooden pailhes hiding at the bottom of my bed shaking said ron angrilymissing the pail and scattering beans over the greenhouse floorcareful weasley careful cried professor sprout as the beans burst into bloom before their very eyesthey had transfiguration next harry who had resolved to ask professor mcgonagall after the lesson whether he could go into hogsmeade with the rest joined the line outside the class trying to decide how he was going to argue his case he was distracted however by a disturbance at the front of the linelavender brown seemed to be crying parvati had her arm around her and was explaining something to seamus finnigan and dean thomas who were looking very seriouswhats the matter lavender said hermione anxiously as she harryand ron went to join the groupshe got a letter from home this morning parvati whispered its her rabbit binky hes been killed by a foxoh said hermione im sorry lavenderi should have known said lavender tragically you know what day it iser the sixteenth of october that thing youre dreading it will happen on the sixteenth of october remember she was right she was rightthe whole class was gathered around lavender now seamus shook his head seriously hermione hesitated then she said you you were dreading binky being killed by a foxwell not necessarily by a fox said lavender looking up at hermione with streaming eyes but i was obviously dreading him dying wasnt loh said hermione she paused again then was binky an old rabbitn no sobbed lavender h he was only a babyparvati tightened her arm around lavenders shouldersbut then why would you dread him dying said hermioneparvati glared at herwell look at it logically said hermione turning to the rest of the group i mean binky didnt even die today did he lavender just got the news today lavender wailed loudly and she cant have been dreading it because its come as a real shock dont mind hermione lavender said ron loudly she doesnt think other peoples pets matter very muchprofessor mcgonagall opened the classroom door at that moment which was perhaps lucky hermione and ron were looking daggers at each other and when they got into class they seated themselves on either side of harry and didnt talk to each other for the whole classharry still hadnt decided what he was going to say to professor mcgonagall when the bell rang at the end of the lesson but it was she who brought up the subject of hogsmeade firstone moment please she called as the class made to leave as youre all in my house you should hand hogsmeade permission forms to me before halloween no form no visiting the village so dont forgetneville put up his handplease professor i i think ive lost your grandmother sent yours to me directly longbottom said professor mcgonagall she seemed to think it was safer well thats all you may leaveask her now ron hissed at harryoh but hermione begango for it harry said ron stubbornlyharry waited for the rest of the class to disappear then headed nervously for professor mcgonagalls deskyes potter harry took a deep breathprofessor my aunt and uncle er forgot to sign my form he saidprofessor mcgonagall looked over her square spectacles at him but didnt say anythingso er dyou think it would be all right mean will it be okay if i if i go to hogsmeadeprofessor mcgonagall looked down and began shuffling papers on her deskim afraid not potter she said you heard what i said no form no visiting the village thats the rulebut professor my aunt and uncle you know theyre muggles they dont really understand about about hogwarts forms and stuff harry said while ron egged him on with vigorous nods if you said i could gobut i dont say so said professor mcgonagall standing up and piling her papers neatly into a drawer the form clearly states that the parent or guardian must give permission she turned to look at himwith an odd expression on her face was it pity im sorry potter but thats my final word you had better hurry or youll be late for your next lessonthere was nothing to be done ron called professor mcgonagall a lot of names that greatly annoyed hermione hermione assumed an all for the best expression that made ron even angrier and harry had to endure everyone in the class talking loudly and happily about what they were going to do first once they got into hogsmeadetheres always the feast said ron in an effort to cheer harry upyou know the halloween feast in the eveningyeah said harry gloomily greatthe halloween feast was always good but it would taste a lot better if he was coming to it after a day in hogsmeade with everyone else nothing anyone said made him feel any better about being left behind dean thomas who was good with a quill had offered to forge uncle vernons signature on the form but as harry had already told professor mcgonagall he hadnt had it signed that was no good ron halfheartedly suggested the invisibility cloak but hermione stamped on that onereminding ron what dumbledore had told them about the dementors being able to see through them percy had what were possibly the least helpful words of comfortthey make a fuss about hogsmeade but i assure you harry its not all its cracked up to be he said seriously all right the sweetshops rather good and zonkos joke shops frankly dangerous and yes the shrieking shacks always worth a visit but really harry apart from that youre not missing anythingon halloween morning harry awoke with the rest and went down to breakfast feeling thoroughly depressed though doing his best to act normallywell bring you lots of sweets back from honeydukes said hermionelooking desperately sorry for himyeah loads said ron he and hermione had finally forgotten their squabble about crookshanks in the face of harrys difficultiesdont worry about me said harry in what he hoped was at offhand voice ill see you at the feast have a good timehe accompanied them to the entrance hall where filch the caretakerwas standing inside the front doors checking off names against a long list peering suspiciously into every face and making sure that no one was sneaking out who shouldnt be goingstaying here potter shouted malfoy who was standing in line with crabbe and goyle scared of passing the dementorsharry ignored him and made his solitary way up the marble staircasethrough the deserted corridors and back to gryffindor towerpassword said the fat lady jerking out of a dozefortuna major said harry listlesslythe portrait swung open and he climbed through the hole into the common room it was full of chattering first and second years and a few older students who had obviously visited hogsmeade so often the novelty had worn off harry harry hi harryit was colin creevey a second year who was deeply in awe of harry and never missed an opportunity to speak to himarent you going to hogsmeade harry why not hey colin looked eagerly around at his friends you can come and sit with us if you like harryer no thanks colin said harry who wasnt in the mood to have alot of people staring avidly at the scar on his forehead i ive got to go to the library got to get some work doneafter that he had no choice but to turn right around and head back out of the portrait hole againwhat was the point waking me up the fat lady called grumpily after him as he walked awayharry wandered dispiritedly toward the library but halfway there he changed his mind he didnt feel like working he turned around and came face to face with filch who had obviously just seen off the last of the hogsmeade visitorswhat are you doing filch snarled suspiciouslynothing said harry truthfullynothing spat filch his jowls quivering unpleasantly a likely story sneaking around on your own why arent you in hogsmeade buying stink pellets and belch powder and whizzing worms like the rest of your nasty little friendsharry shruggedwell get back to your common room where you belong snapped filchand he stood glaring until harry had passed out of sightbut harry didnt go back to the common room he climbed a staircasethinking vaguely of visiting the owlery to see hedwig and was walking along another corridor when a voice from inside one of the rooms saidharryharry doubled back to see who had spoken and met professor lupinlooking around his office doorwhat are you doing said lupin though in a very different voice from filch where are ron and hermionehogsmeade said harry in a would be casual voiceah said lupin he considered harry for a moment why dont you come in ive just taken delivery of a grindylow for our next lesson a what said harry i he followed lupin into his office in the corner stood a very large tank of water a sickly green creature with sharp little horns had its face pressed against the glass pulling faces and flexing its long spindly fingerswater demon said lupin surveying the grindylow thoughtfully we shouldnt have much difficulty with him not after the kappas the trick is to break his grip you notice the abnormally long fingers strongbut very brittlethe grindylow bared its green teeth and then buried itself in a tangle of weeds in a cornercup of tea lupin said looking around for his kettle i was just thinking of making oneall right said harry awkwardlylupin tapped the kettle with his wand and a blast of steam issued suddenly from the spoutsit down said lupin taking the lid off a dusty tin ive only got teabags im afraid but i daresay youve had enough of tea leavesharry looked at him lupins eyes were twinklinghow did you know about that harry askedprofessor mcgonagall told me said lupin passing harry a chipped mug of tea youre not worried are youno said harryhe thought for a moment of telling lupin about the dog hed seen in magnolia crescent but decided not to he didnt want lupin to think hewas a coward especially since lupin alreadv seemed to think he couldnt cope with a boggartsomething of harrys thoughts seemed to have shown on his face because lupin said anything worrying you harryno harry lied he drank a bit of tea and watched the grindylow brandishing a fist at him yes he said suddenly putting his tea down on lupins desk you know that day we fought the boggartyes said lupin slowlywhy didnt you let me fight it said harry abruptlylupin raised his eyebrowsi would have thought that was obvious harry he said sounding surprisedharry who had expected lupin to deny that hed done any such thing was taken abackwhy he said againwell said lupin frowning slightly i assumed that if the boggart faced you it would assume the shape of lord voldemortharry stared not only was this the last answer hed expected but lupin had said voldemorts name the only person harry had ever heard say the name aloud apart from himself was professor dumbledoreclearly i was wrong said lupin still frowning at harry but i didnt think it a good idea for lord voldemort to materialize in the staffroom i imagined that people would panici didnt think of voldemort said harry honestly i i remembered those dementorsi see said lupin thoughtfully well well im impressed fie smiled slightly at the look of surprise on harrys face that suggeststhat what you fear most of all is fear very wise harryharry didnt know what to say to that so he drank some mot teaso youve been thinking that i didnt believe you capable of fighting the boggart said lupin shrewdlywell yeah said harry he was suddenly feeling a lot happierprofessor lupin you know the dementors he was interrupted by a knock on the doorcome in called lupinthe door opened and in came snape he was carrying a goblet which was smoking faintly and stopped at the sight of harry his black eyes narrowingah severus said lupin smiling thanks very much could you leave it here on the desk for mesnape set down the smoking goblet his eyes wandering between harry and lupini was just showing harry my grindylow said lupin pleasantly pointing at the tankfascinating said snape without looking at it you should drink that directly lupinyes yes i will said lupini made an entire cauldronful snape continued if you need morei should probably take some again tomorrow thanks very much severusnot at all said snape but there was a look in his eye harry didnt like he backed out of the room unsmiling and watchfulharry looked curiously at the goblet lupin smiledprofessor snape has very kindly concocted a potion for me he said i have never been much of a potion brewer and this one is particularly complex he picked up the goblet and sniffed it pity sugar makes it useless he added taking a sip and shudderingwhy harry began lupin looked at him and answered the unfinished questionive been feeling a bit off color he said this potion is the only thing that helps i am very lucky to be working alongside professor snape there arent many wizards who are up to making itprofessor lupin took another sip and harry had a crazy urge to knock the goblet out of his handsprofessor snapes very interested in the dark arts he blurted outreally said lupin looking only mildly interested as he took another gulp of potionsome people reckon harry hesitated then plunged recklessly onsome people reckon hed do anything to get the defense against the dark arts joblupin drained the goblet and pulled a facedisgusting he said well harry id better get back to work see you at the feast laterright said harry putting down his empty teacupthe empty goblet was still smokingthere you go said ron we got as much as we could carrya shower of brilliantly colored sweets fell into harrys lap it was dusk and ron and hermione had just turned up in the common roompink faced from the cold wind and looking as though theyd had the time of their livesthanks said harry picking up a packet of tiny black pepper impswhats hogsmeade like where did you goby the sound of it everywhere dervish and banges the wizarding equipment shop zonkos joke shop into the three broomsticks for foaming mugs of hot butterbeer and many places besidesthe post office harry about two hundred owls all sitting on shelvesall color coded depending on how fast you want your letter to get therehoneydukes has got a new kind of fudge they were giving out free samples theres a bit look we think we saw an ogre honestly they get all sorts at the three broomsticks wish we could have brought you some butterbeer really warms you up what did you do said hermione looking anxious did you get any work doneno said harry lupin made me a cup of tea in his office and then snape came inhe told them all about the goblet rons mouth fell openlupin drank it he gasped is he madhermione checked her watchwed better go down you know the feastll be starting in fiveminutes they hurried through the portrait hole and into the crowd still discussing snapebut if he you know hermione dropped her voice glancing nervously around if he was trying to to poison lupin he wouldnt have done it in front of harryyeah maybe said harry as they reached the entrance hall and crossed into the great hall it had been decorated with hundreds and hundreds of candle filled pumpkins a cloud of fluttering live bats and many flaming orange streamers which were swimming lazily across the stormy ceiling like brilliant watersnakesthe food was delicious even hermione and ron who were full to bursting with honeydukes sweets managed second helpings of everything harry kept glancing at the staff table professor lupin looked cheerful and as well as he ever did he was talking animatedly to tiny little professor flitwick the charms teacher harry moved his eyes along the table to the place where snape sat was he imagining it or were snapes eyes flickering toward lupin more often than was naturalthe feast finished with an entertainment provided by the hogwarts ghosts they popped out of the walls and tables to do a bit of formation gliding nearly headless nick the gryffindor ghost had a great success with a reenactment of his own botched beheadingit had been such a pleasant evening that harrys good mood couldnt even be spoiled by malfoy who shouted through the crowd as they all left the hall the dementors send their love potterharry ron and hermione followed the rest of the gryffindors along the usual path to gryffindor tower but when they reached the corridor that ended with the portrait of the fat lady they found it jammed with studentswhy isnt anyone going in said ron curiouslyharry peered over the heads in front of him the portrait seemed to be closedlet me through please came percys voice and he came bustling importantly through the crowd whats the holdup here you cant all have forgotten the password excuse me im head boy and then a silence fell over the crowd from the front first so that a chill seemed to spread down the corridor they heard percy say in asuddenly sharp voice somebody get professor dumbledore quickpeoples heads turned those at the back were standing on tiptoewhats going on said ginny who had just arriveda moment later professor dumbledore was there sweeping toward the portrait the gryffindors squeezed together to let him through and harry ron and hermione moved closer to see what the trouble wasoh my hermione grabbed harrys armthe fat lady had vanished from her portrait which had been slashed so viciously that strips of canvas littered the floor great chunks of it had been torn away completelydumbledore took one quick look at the ruined painting and turned his eyes somber to see professors mcgonagall lupin and snape hurrying toward himwe need to find her said dumbledore professor mcgonagall please go to mr filch at once and tell him to search every painting in the castle for the fat ladyyoull be lucky said a cackling voiceit was peeves the poltergeist bobbing over the crowd and looking delighted as he always did at the sight of wreckage or worrywhat do you mean peeves said dumbledore calmly and peevess grin faded a little he didnt dare taunt dumbledore instead he adopted an oily voice that was no better than his cackle ashamed your headshipsit doesnt want to be seen shes a horrible mess saw her running through the landscape up on the fourth floor sir dodging between the trees crying something dreadful he said happily poor thing he added unconvincinglydid she say who did it said dumbledore quietlyoh yes professorhead said peeves with the air of one cradling alarge bombshell in his arms he got very angry when she wouldnt let him in you see peeves flipped over and grinned at dumbledore from between his own legs nasty temper hes got that sirius blackchapter nine grim defeatprofessor dumbledore sent all the gryffindors back to the great hallwhere they were joined ten minutes later by the students from hufflepuff ravenclaw and slytherin who all looked extremely confusedthe teachers and i need to conduct a thorough search of the castleprofessor dumbledore told them as professors mcgonagall and flitwick closed all doors into the hall im afraid that for your own safetyyou will have to spend the night here i want the prefects to stand guard over the entrances to the hall and i am leaving the head boy and girl in charge any disturbance should be reported to me immediatelyhe added to percy who was looking immensely proud and important send word with one of the ghostsprofessor dumbledore paused about to leave the hall and said ohyes youll be needingone casual wave of his wand and the long tables flew to the edges of the hall and stood themselves against the walls another wave and the floor was covered with hundreds of squashy purple sleeping bagssleep well said professor dumbledore closing the door behind himthe hall immediately began to buzz excitedly the gryffindors were telling the rest of the school what had just happenedeveryone into their sleeping bags shouted percy come on now no more talking lights out in ten minutescmon ron said to harry and hermione they seized three sleeping bags and dragged them into a cornerdo you think blacks still in the castle hermione whisperedanxiouslydumbledore obviously thinks he might be said ronits very lucky he picked tonight you know said hermione as they climbed fully dressed into their sleeping bags and propped themselves on their elbows to talk the one night we werent in the toweri reckon hes lost track of time being on the run said ron didnt realize it was halloween otherwise hed have come bursting in herehermione shudderedall around them people were asking one another the same question how did he get inmaybe he knows how to apparate said a ravenclaw a few feet awayjust appear out of thin air you knowdisguised himself probably said a hufflepuff fifth year he couldve flown in suggested dean thomashonestly am i the only person whos ever bothered to read hogwarts a history said hermione crossly to harry and ronprobably said ron whybecause the castles protected by more than walls you know said hermione there are all sorts of enchantments on it to stop people entering by stealth you cant just apparate in here and id like to see the disguise that could fool those dementors theyre guarding every single entrance to the grounds theyd have seen him fly in too and fitch knows all the secret passages theyll have them coveredthe lights are going out now percy shouted i want everyone in their sleeping bags and no more talkingthe candles all went out at once the only light now came from the silvery ghosts who were drifting about talking seriously to the prefects and the enchanted ceiling which like the sky outside wasscattered with stars what with that and the whispering that still filled the hall harry felt as though he were sleeping outdoors in a light windonce every hour a teacher would reappear in the hall to check that everything was quiet around three in the morning when many students had finally fallen asleep professor dumbledore came in harry watched him looking around for percy who had been prowling between the sleeping bags telling people off for talking percy was only a short way away from harry ron and hermlone who quickly pretended to be asleep as dumbledores footsteps drew nearerany sign of him professor asked percy in a whisperno all well hereeverything under control sirgood theres no point moving them all now ive found a temporary guardian for the gryffindor portrait hole youll be able to move them back in tomorrowand the fat lady sirhiding in a map of argyllshire on the second floor apparently she refused to let black in without the password so he attacked shes still very distressed but once shes calmed down ill have mr filch restore herharry heard the door of the hall creak open again and more footstepsheadmaster it was snape harry kept quite still listening hard the whole of the third floor has been searched hes not there and filch has done the dungeons nothing there eitherwhat about the astronomy tower professor trelawneys room the owleryall searchedvery well severus i didnt really expect black to lingerhave you any theory as to how he got in professor asked snapeharry raised his head very slightly off his arms to free his other earmany severus each of them as unlikely as the nextharry opened his eyes a fraction and squinted up to where they stood dumbledores back was to him but he could see percys face rapt with attention and snapes profile which looked angryyou remember the conversation we had headmaster just before ah the start of term said snape who was barely opening his lips as though trying to block percy out of the conversationi do severus said dumbledore and there was something like warning in his voiceit seems almost impossible that black could have entered the school without inside help i did express my concerns whet you appointed i do not believe a single person inside this castle would have helped black enter it said dumbledore and his tone made it so clear that the subject was closed that snape didnt reply i must go down to the dementors said dumbledore i said i would inform them when our search was completedidnt they want to help sit said percyoh yes said dumbledore coldly but im afraid no dementor will cross the threshold of this castle while i am headmasterpercy looked slightly abashed dumbledore left the hall walking quickly and quietly snape stood for a moment watching the headmaster with an expression of deep resentment on his face then he too leftharry glanced sideways at ron and hermione both of them had their eyes open too reflecting the starry ceilingwhat was all that about ron mouthedthe school talked of nothing but sirius black for the next few days the theories about how he had entered the castle became wilder and wilder hannah abbott from hufflepuff spent much of their next herbology class telling anyone whod listen that black could turn into a flowering shrubthe fat ladys ripped canvas had been taken off the wall and replaced with the portrait of sir cadogan and his fat gray pony nobody was very happy about this sir cadogan spent half his time challenging people to duels and the rest thinking up ridiculously complicated passwords which he changed at least twice a dayhes a complete lunatic said seamus finnigan angrily to percy cant we get anyone elsenone of the other pictures wanted the job said percy frightened of what happened to the fat lady sir cadogan was the only one brave enough to volunteersir cadogan however was the least of harrys worries he was now being closely watched teachers found excuses to walk along corridors with him and percy weasley acting harry suspected on his mothers orders was tailing him everywhere like an extremely pompous guard dog to cap it all professor mcgonagall summoned harry into her office with such a somber expression on her face harry thought someone must have diedtheres no point hiding it from you any longer potter she said in a very serious voice i know this will come as a shock to you but sirius black i know hes after me said harry wearily i heard rons dad telling his mum mr weasley works for the ministry of magicprofessor mcgonagall seemed very taken aback she stared at harry for a moment or two then said i see well in that case potter youll understand why i dont think its a good idea for you to be practicingquidditch in the evenings out on the field with only your team membersits very exposed potter weve got our first match on saturday said harry outraged ive got to train professorprofessor mcgonagall considered him intently harry knew she was deeply interested in the gryffindor teams prospects it had been she after all whod suggested him as seeker in the first place he waitedholding his breathhmm professor mcgonagall stood up and stared out of the window at the quidditch field just visible through the rain well goodness knows id like to see us win the cup at last but all the samepotter id be happier if a teacher were present ill ask madam hooch to oversee your training sessionsthe weather worsened steadily as the first quidditch match drew nearerundaunted the gryffindor team was training harder than ever under the eye of madam hooch then at their final training session before saturdays match oliver wood gave his team some unwelcome newswere not playing slytherin he told them looking very angryflints just been to see me were playing hufflepuff insteadwhy chorused the rest of the teamflints excuse is that their seekers arms still injured said woodgrinding his teeth furiously but its obvious why theyre doing itdont want to play in this weather think itll damage their chancesthere had been strong winds and heavy rain all day and as wood spokethey heard a distant rumble of thundertheres nothing wrong with malfoys arm said harry furiously hes faking iti know that but we cant prove it said wood bitterly and weve been practicing all those moves assuming were playing slytherin andinstead its hufflepuff and their styles quite different theyve got a new captain and seeker cedric diggory angelina alicia and katie suddenly giggledwhat said wood frowning at this lighthearted behaviorhes that tall good looking one isnt he said angelinastrong and silent said katie and they started to giggle againhes only silent because hes too thick to string two words togethersaid fred impatiently i dont know why youre worried oliverhufflepuff is a pushover last time we played them harry caught the snitch in about five minutes rememberwe were playing in completely different conditions wood shouted his eyes bulging slightly diggorys put a very strong side together hes an excellent seeker i was afraid youd take it like this we mustnt relax we must keep our focus slytherin is trying to wrong foot us we must winoliver calm down said fred looking slightly alarmed were taking hufflepuff very seriously seriouslythe day before the match the winds reached howling point and the rain fell harder than ever it was so dark inside the corridors and classrooms that extra torches and lanterns were lit the slytherin team was looking very smug indeed and none more so than malfoyah if only my arm was feeling a bit better he sighed as the gale outside pounded the windowsharry had no room in his head to worry about anything except the match tomorrow oliver wood kept hurrying up to him between classes and giving him tips the third time this happened wood talked for so long that harry suddenly realized he was ten minutes late for defense against the dark arts and set off at a run with wood shouting after him diggorys got a very fast swerve harry so you might want to try looping him harry skidded to a halt outside the defense against the dark arts classroom pulled the door open and dashed insidesorry im late professor lupin i but it wasnt professor lupin who looked up at him from the teachers desk it was snapethis lesson began ten minutes ago potter so i think well make it ten points from gryffindor sit downbut harry didnt movewheres professor lupin he saidhe says he is feeling too ill to teach today said snape with a twisted smile i believe i told you to sit downbut harry stayed where he waswhats wrong with himsnapes black eyes glitterednothing life threatening he said looking as though he wished it were five more points from gryffindor and if i have to ask you to sit down again it will be fiftyharry walked slowly to his seat and sat down snape looked around at the classas i was saying before potter interrupted professor lupin has not left any record of the topics you have covered so far please sir weve done boggarts red caps kappas and grindylowssaid hermione quickly and were just about to start be quiet said snape coldly i did not ask for information i was merely commenting on professor lupins lack of organizationhes the best defense against the dark arts teacher weve ever hadsaid dean thomas boldly and there was a murmur of agreement from the rest of the class snape looked more menacing than everyou are easily satisfied lupin is hardly overtaxing you i would expect first years to be able to deal with red caps and grindylowstoday we shall discuss harry watched him flick through the textbook to the very back chapterwhich he must know they hadnt coveredwerewolves said snapebut sir said hermione seemingly unable to restrain herself were not supposed to do werewolves yet were due to start hinkypunks miss granger said snape in a voice of deadly calm i was under the impression that i am teaching this lesson not you and i am telling you all to turn to page he glanced around again all of you nowwith many bitter sidelong looks and some sullen muttering the class opened their bookswhich of you can tell me how we distinguish between the werewolf and the true wolf said snapeeveryone sat in motionless silence everyone except hermione whose hand as it so often did had shot straight into the airanyone snape said ignoring hermione his twisted smile was backare you telling me that professor lupin hasnt even taught you the basic distinction between we told you said parvati suddenly we havent got as far as werewolves yet were still on silence snarled snape well well well i never thought id meet a third year class who wouldnt even recognize a werewolf when they saw one i shall make a point of informing professor dumbledore how very behind you all areplease sir said hermione whose hand was still in the air the werewolf differs from the true wolf in several small ways the snout of the werewolf that is the second time you have spoken out of turn miss grangersaid snape coolly five more points from gryffindor for being an insufferable know it allhermione went very red put down her hand and stared at the floor with her eyes full of tears it was a mark of how much the class loathed snape that they were all glaring at him because every one of them had called hermione a know it all at least once and ron who told hermione she was a know it all at least twice a week said loudly you asked us a question and she knows the answer why ask if you dont want to be toldthe class knew instantly hed gone too far snape advanced on ron slowly and the room held its breathdetention weasley snape said silkily his face very close to ronsand if i ever hear you criticize the way i teach a class again you will be very sorry indeedno one made a sound throughout the rest of the lesson they sat and made notes on werewolves from the textbook while snape prowled up and down the rows of desks examining the work they had been doing with professor lupinvery poorly explained that is incorrect the kappa is more commonly found in mongolia professor lupin gave this eight out of ten i wouldnt have given it threewhen the bell rang at last snape held them backyou will each write an essay to be handed in to me on the ways you recognize and kill werewolves i want two rolls of parchment or the subject and i want them by monday morning it is time somebody took this class in hand weasley stay behind we need to arrange your detentionharry and hermione left the room with the rest of the class who waited until they were well out of earshot then burst into a furious tirade about snapesnapes never been like this with any of our other defense against the dark arts teachers even if he did want the job harry said to hermione whys he got it in for lupin dyou think this is all because of the boggarti dont know said hermione pensively but i really hope professor lupin gets better soonron caught up with them five minutes later in a towering ragedyou know what that he called snape something that made hermione say ron is making me do ive got to scrub out the bedpans in the hospital wing without magic he was breathing deeply his fists clenched why couldnt black have hidden in snapes office eh he could have finished him off for usharry woke extremely early the next morning so early that it was till dark for a moment he thought the roaring of the wind had woken himthen he felt a cold breeze on the back of his neck and sat bolt upright peeves the poltergeist had been floating next to him blowing hard in his earwhat did you do that for said harry furiously peeves puffed out his cheeks blew hard and zoomed backward out of the room cacklingharry fumbled for his alarm clock and looked at it it was half past four cursing peeves he rolled over and tried to get back to sleep but it was very difficult now that he was awake to ignore the sounds of the thunder rumbling overhead the pounding of the wind against the castle walls and the distant creaking of the trees in the forbidden forest in a few hours he would be out on the quidditch field battling through that gale finally he gave up any thought of more sleep got up dressed picked up his nimbus two thousand and walked quietly out of the dormitoryas harry opened the door something brushed against his leg he bent down just in time to grab crookshanks by the end of his bushy tail and drag him outsideyou know i reckon ron was right about you harry told crookshanks suspiciously there are plenty of mice around this place go and chase them go on he added nudging crookshanks down the spiral staircase with his foot leave scabbers alonethe noise of the storm was even louder in the common roorn harry knew better than to think the match would be canceled quidditch matches werent called off for trifles like thunderstorms nevertheless he was starting to feel very apprehensive wood had pointed out cedric diggory to him in the corridor diggory was a fifth year and a lot bigger than harry seekers were usually light and speedy but diggorys weight would be an advantage in this weather because he was less likely to be blown off courseharry whiled away the hours until dawn in front of the fire getting up every now and then to stop crookshanks from sneaking up the boys staircase again at long last harry thought it must be time for breakfast so he headed through the portrait hole alonestand and fight you mangy cur yelled sir cadoganoh shut up harry yawnedhe revived a bit over a large bowl of porridge and by the time hed started on toast the rest of the team had turned upits going to be a tough one said wood who wasnt eating anythingstop worrying oliver said alicia soothingly we dont mind a bit of rainbut it was considerably more than a bit of rain such was the popularity of quidditch that the whole school turned out to watch the match as usual but they ran down the lawns toward the quidditch field headsbowed against the ferocious wind umbrellas being whipped out of their hands as they went just before he entered the locker room harry saw malfoy crabbe and goyle laughing and pointing at him from under an enormous umbrella on their way to the stadiumthe team changed into their scarlet robes and waited for woods usual pre match pep talk but it didnt come he tried to speak several timesmade an odd gulping noise then shook his head hopelessly and beckoned them to follow himthe wind was so strong that they staggered sideways as they walked out onto the field if the crowd was cheering they couldnt hear it over the fresh rolls of thunder rain was splattering over harrys glasseshow on earth was he going to see the snitch in thisthe hufflepuffs were approaching from the opposite side of the fieldwearing canary yellow robes the captains walked up to eacb other and shook hands diggory smiled at wood but wood no looked as though he had lockjaw and merely nodded harry saw madam hoochs mouth form the wordsmount your brooms he pulled his right foot out of the mud with a squelch and swung it over his nimbus two thousand madam hooch put her whistle to her lips and gave it a blast that sounded shrill and distant they were off harry rose fast but his nimbus was swerving slightly with the wind he held it as steady as he could and turned squinting into the rainwithin five minutes harry was soaked to his skin and frozen hardly able to see his teammates let alone the tiny snitch he flew backward and forward across the field past blurred red and yellow shapes with no idea of what was happening in the rest of the game he couldnt hear the commentary over the wind the crowd was hidden beneath a sea of cloaks and battered umbrellas twice harry came very close to being unseated by a bludger his vision was so clouded by the rain on his glasses he hadnt seen them cominghe lost track of time it was getting harder and harder to hold his broom straight the sky was getting darker as though night had decided to come early twice harry nearly hit another player without knowing whether it was a teammate or opponent everyone was now so wet and therain so thick he could hardly tell them apartwith the first flash of lightning came the sound of madam hoochs whistle harry could just see the outline of wood through the thick rain gesturing him to the ground the whole team splashed down into the mudi called for time out wood roared at his team come on under here they huddled at the edge of the field under a large umbrella harry took off his glasses and wiped them hurriedly on his robeswhats the scorewere fifty points up said wood but unless we get the snitch soonwell be playing into the nightive got no chance with these on harry said exasperatedly waving his glassesat that very moment hermione appeared at his shoulder she was holding her cloak over her head and was inexplicably beamingive had an idea harry give me your glasses quickhe handed them to her and as the team watched in amazement hermione tapped them with her wand and said imperviusthere she said handing them back to harry theyll repel waterwood looked as though he could have kissed herbrilliant he called hoarsely after her as she disappeared into the crowd okay team lets go for ithermiones spell had done the trick harry was still numb with coldstill wetter than hed ever been in his life but he could see full of fresh determination he urged his broom through the turbulent airstaring in every direction for the snitch avoiding a bludger duckingbeneath diggory who was streaking in the opposite directionthere was another clap of thunder followed immediately by forked lightning this was getting more and more dangerous harry needed to get the snitch quickly he turned intending to head back toward the middle of the field but at that moment another flash of lightning illuminated the stands and harry saw something that distracted him completely the silhouette of an enormous shaggy black dog clearly imprinted against the skymotionless in the topmost empty row of seatsharrys numb hands slipped on the broom handle and his nimbus dropped a few feet shaking his sodden bangs out of his eyes he squinted back into the stands the dog had vanishedharry came woods anguished yell from the gryffindor goal postsharry behind youharry looked wildly around cedric diggory was pelting up the field and a tiny speck of gold was shimmering in the rain filled air between them with a jolt of panic harry threw himself flat to the broornhandle and zoomed toward the snitchcome on he growled at his nimbus as the rain whipped his facetasterbut something odd was happening an eerie silence was falling across the stadium the wind though as strong as ever was forgetting to roar it was as though someone had turned off the sound as though harry had gone suddenly deaf what was going onand then a horribly familiar wave of cold swept over him inside himjust as he became aware of something moving on the field belowbefore hed had time to think harry had taken his eyes off the snitch and looked downat least a hundred dementors their hidden faces pointing up at himwere standing beneath him it was as though freezing water were rising in his chest cutting at his insides and then he heard it againsomeone was screaming screaming inside his head a womannot harry not harry please not harrystand aside you silly girl stand aside nownot harry please no take me kill me instead numbing swirling white mist was filling harrys brain what was he doing why was he flying he needed to help her she was going to die she was going to be murderedhe was falling falling through the icy mistnot harry please have mercy have mercya shrill voice was laughing the woman was screaming and harry knew no morelucky the ground was so softi thought he was dead for surebut he didnt even break his glassesharry could hear the voices whispering but they made no sense whatsoever he didnt have a clue where he was or how hed got thereor what hed been doing before he got there all he knew was that every inch of him was aching as though it had been beatenthat was the scariest thing ive ever seen in my lifescariest the scariest thing hooded black figures cold screamingharrys eyes snapped open he was lying in the hospital wing the gryffindor quidditch team spattered with mud from head to foot wasgathered around his bed ron and hermione were also there looking as though theyd just climbed out of a swimming poolharry said fred who looked extremely white underneath the mudhowre you feelingit was as though harrys memory was on fast forward the lightning the grim the snitch and the dementorswhat happened he said sitting up so suddenly they all gaspedyou fell off said fred mustve been what fifty feetwe thought youd died said alicia who was shakinghermione made a small squeaky noise her eyes were extremely bloodshotbut the match said harry what happened are we doing a replayno one said anything the horrible truth sank into harry like a stonewe didnt losediggory got the snitch said george just after you fell he didnt realize what had happened when he looked back and saw you on the ground he tried to call it off wanted a rematch but they won fair and square even wood admits itwhere is wood said harry suddenly realizing he wasnt therestill in the showers said fred we think hes trying to drown himselfharry put his face to his knees his hands gripping his hair fred grabbed his shoulder and shook it roughlycmon harry youve never missed the snitch beforethere had to be one time you didnt get it said georgeits not over yet said fred we lost by a hundred pointsright so if hufflepuff loses to ravenclaw and we beat ravenclaw and slytherin hufflepuffll have to lose by at least two hundred points said georgebut if they beat ravenclawno way ravenclaw is too good but if slytherin loses against hufflepuffit all depends on the points a margin of a hundred either wayharry lay there not saying a word they had lost for the first time ever he had lost a quidditch matchafter ten minutes or so madam pomfrey came over to tell the team to leave him in peacewell come and see you later fred told him dont beat yourself upharry youre still the best seeker weve ever hadthe team trooped out trailing mud behind them madam pomfrey shut the door behind them looking disapproving ron and hermione moved nearer to harrys beddumbledore was really angry hermione said in a quaking voice ive never seen him like that before he ran onto the field as you fellwaved his wand and you sort of slowed down before you hit the groundthen he whirled his wand at the dementors shot silver stuff at themthey left the stadium right away he was furious theyd come onto the grounds we heard him then he magicked you onto a stretcher said ron and walked up to school with you floating on it everyone thought you were his voice faded but harry hardly noticed he was thinking about what the dementors had done to him about the screaming voice he looked upand saw ron and hermione lookin at him so anxiously that he quickly cast around for something matter of fact to saydid someone get my nimbusron and hermione looked quickly at each otherer what said harry looking from one to the otherwell when you fell off it got blown away said hermione hesitantlyandand it hit it hit oh harry it hit the whomping willowharrys insides lurched the whomping willow was a very violent tree that stood alone in the middle of the groundsand he said dreading the answerwell you know the whomping willow said ron it it doesnt like being hitprofessor flitwick brought it back just before you came around said hermione in a very small voiceslowly she reached down for a bag at her feet turned it upside downand tipped a dozen bits of splintered wood and twig onto the bed the only remains of harrys faithful finally beaten broomstickchapter ten the marauders mapmadam pomfrey insisted on keeping harry in the hospital wing for the rest of the weekend he didnt argue or complain but he wouldnt let her throw away the shattered remnants of his nimbus two thousand heknew he was being stupid knew that the nimbus was beyond repair but harry couldnt help it he felt as though hed lost one of his best friendshe had a stream of visitors all intent on cheering him up hagrid sent him a bunch of earwiggy flowers that looked like yellow cabbages and ginny weasley blushing furiously turned up with a get well card she had made herself which sang shrilly unless harry kept it shut under his bowl of fruit the gryffindor team visited again on sunday morning this time accompanied by wood who told harry in a hollow dead sort of voice that he didnt blame him in the slightest ron and hermione left harrys bedside only at night but nothing anyone said or did could make harry feel any betterbecause they knew only half of what was troubling himhe hadnt told anyone about the grim not even ron and hermionebecause he knew ron would panic and hermione would scoff the fact remained however that it had now appeared twice and both appearances had been followed by near fatal accidents the first time he had nearly been run over by the knight bus the second fallen fifty feet from his broomstick was the grim going to haunt him until he actually died was he going to spend the rest of his life looking over his shoulder for the beastand then there were the dementors harry felt sick and humiliated every time he thought of them everyone said the dementors were horrible but no one else collapsed every time they went near one no one else heard echoes in their head of their dying parentsbecause harry knew who that screaming voice belonged to now he had heard her words heard them over and over again during the night hours in the hospital wing while he lay awake staring at the strips of moonlight on the ceiling when the dementors approached him he heard the last moments of his mothers life her attempts to protect himharry from lord voldemort and voldemorts laughter before he murdered her harry dozed fitfully sinking into dreams full of clammy rotted hands and petrified pleading jerking awake to dwell again on hismothers voiceit was a relief to return to the noise and bustle of the main school on monday where he was forced to think about other things eve if he had to endure draco malfoys taunting malfoy was almost beside himself with glee at gryffindors defeat he had finally taken off his bandages and celebrated having the full use of both arms again by doing spirited imitations of harry falling off his broom malfoy spent much of their next potions class doing dementor imitations across the dungeon ron finally cracked and flung a large slippery crocodile heart at malfoywhich hit him in the face and caused snape to take fifty points from gryffindorif snapes teaching defense against the dark arts again im skiving off said ron as they headed toward lupins classroom after lunchcheck whos in there hermionehermione peered around the classroom doorits okayprofessor lupin was back at work it certainly looked as though he had been ill his old robes were hanging more loosely on him and there were dark shadows beneath his eyes nevertheless he smiled at the class as they took their seats and they burst at once into an explosion of complaints about snapes behavior while lupin had been illits not fair he was only filling in why should he give us homeworkwe dont know anything about werewolves two rolls of parchmentdid you tell professor snape we havent covered them yet lupin askedfrowning slightlythe babble broke out againyes but he said we were really behind he wouldnt listen two rolls of parchmentprofessor lupin smiled at the look of indignation on every facedont worry ill speak to professor snape you dont have to do the essayoh no said hermione looking very disappointed ive already finished itthey had a very enjoyable lesson professor lupin had brought along a glass box containing a hinkypunk a little one legged creature who looked as though he were made of wisps of smoke rather frail and harmless lookinglures travelers into bogs said professor lupin as they took notesyou notice the lantern dangling from his hand hops ahead people follow the light then the hinkypunk made a horrible squelching noise against the glasswhen the bell rang everyone gathered up their things and headed for the door harry among them but wait a moment harry lupin called id like a wordharry doubled back and watched professor lupin covering the hinkypunks box with a clothi heard about the match said lupin turning back to his desk and starting to pile books into his briefcase and im sorry about your broomstick is there any chance of fixing itno said harry the tree smashed it to bitslupin sighedthey planted the whomping willow the same year that i arrived at hogwarts people used to play a game trying to get near enough to touch the trunk in the end a boy called davey gudgeon nearly lost an eyeand we were forbidden to go near it no broomstick would have a chancedid you hear about the dementors too said harry with difficultylupin looked at him quicklyyes i did i dont think any of us have seen professor dumbledore that angry they have been growing restless for some time furious at his refusal to let them inside the grounds i suppose they were the reason you fellyes said harry he hesitated and then the question he had to ask burst from him before he could stop himself why why do they affect me like that am i just it has nothing to do with weakness said professor lupin sharply as though he had read harrys mind the dementors affect you worse than the others because there are horrors in your past that the others dont havea ray of wintery sunlight fell across the classroom illuminating lupins gray hairs and the lines on his young facedementors are among the foulest creatures that walk this earth they infest the darkest filthiest places they glory in decay and despairthey drain peace hope and happiness out of the air around them even muggles feel their presence though they cant see them get too near a dementor and every good feeling every happy memory will be sucked out of you if it can the dementor will feed on you long enough to reduce you to something like itself soul less and evil youll be left with nothing but the worst experiences of your life and the worst that happened to you harry is enough to make anyone fall off their broomyou have nothing to feel ashamed ofwhen they get near me harry stared at lupins desk his throat tight i can hear voldemort murdering my mumlupin made a sudden motion with his arm as though to grip harrys shoulder but thought better of it there was a moments silence then why did they have to come to the match said harry bitterlytheyre getting hungry said lupin coolly shutting his briefcase with a snap dumbledore wont let them into the school so their supply of human prey has dried up i dont think they could resist the large crowd around the quidditch field all that excitement emotions running high it was their idea of a feastazkaban must be terrible harry muttered lupin nodded grimlythe fortress is set on a tiny island way out to sea but they dont need walls and water to keep the prisoners in not when theyre all trapped inside their own heads incapable of a single cheery thoughtmost of them go mad within weeksbut sirius black escaped from them harry said slowly he got awaylupins briefcase slipped from the desk he had to stoop quickly to catch ityes he said straightening up black must have found a way to fight them i wouldnt have believed it possible dementors are supposed to drain a wizard of his powers if he is left with them too longyou made that dementor on the train back off said harry suddenlythere are certain defenses one can use said lupin but there was only one dementor on the train the more there are the more difficult it becomes to resistwhat defenses said harry at once can you teach mei dont pretend to be an expert at fighting dementors harry quite the contrarybut if the dementors come to another quidditch match i need to be able to fight them lupin looked into harrys determined face hesitated then saidwell all right ill try and help but itll have to wait until nextterm im afraid i have a lot to do before the holidays i chose a very inconvenient time to fall illwhat with the promise of anti dementor lessons from lupin the thought that he might never have to hear his mothers death again and the fact that ravenclaw flattened hufflepuff in their quidditch match at the end of november harrys mood took a definite upturn gryffindor were not out of the running after all although they could not afford to lose another match wood became repossessed of his manic energy and worked his team as hard as ever in the chilly haze of rain that persisted into december harry saw no hint of a dementor within the groundsdumbledores anger seemed to be keeping them at their stations at the entrancestwo weeks before the end of the term the sky lightened suddenly to a dazzling opaline white and the muddy grounds were revealed one morning covered in glittering frost inside the castle there was a buzz of christmas in the air professor flitwick the charms teacher had already decorated his classroom with shimmering lights that turned out to be real fluttering fairies the students were all happily discussing their plans for the holidays both ron and hermione had decided to remain at hogwarts and though ron said it was because he couldnt stand two weeks with percy and hermione insisted she needed to use the library harry wasnt fooled they were doing it to keep him companyand he was very gratefulto everyones delight except harrys there was to be another hogsmeade trip on the very last weekend of the termwe can do all our christmas shopping there said hermione mum and dad would really love those toothflossing stringmints from honeydukesresigned to the fact that he would be the only third year staying behind again harry borrowed a copy of which broomstick from wood and decided to spend the day reading up on the different makes he had been riding one of the school brooms at team practice an ancient shooting starwhich was very slow and jerky he definitely needed a new broom of his ownon the saturday morning of the hogsmeade trip harry bid good bye to ronand hermione who were wrapped in cloaks and scarves then turned up the marble staircase alone and headed back toward gryffindor tower snow had started to fall outside the windows and the castle was very still and quietpsst harryhe turned halfway along the third floor corridor to see fred and george peering out at him from behind a statue of a humpbacked one eyed witchwhat are you doing said harry curiously how come youre not going to hogsmeadeweve come to give you a bit of festive cheer before we go said fredwith a mysterious wink come in herehe nodded toward an empty classroom to the left of the one eyed statueharry followed fred and george inside george closed the door quietly and then turned beaming to look at harryearly christmas present for you harry he saidfred pulled something from inside his cloak with a flourish and laid it on one of the desks it was a large square very worn piece of parchment with nothing written on it harry suspecting one of fred and georges jokes stared at itwhats that supposed to bethis harry is the secret of our success said george patting the parchment fondlyits a wrench giving it to you said fred but we decided last night your needs greater than oursanyway we know it by heart said george we bequeath it to you we dont really need it anymoreand what do i need with a bit of old parchment said harrya bit of old parchment said fred closing his eyes with a grimace as though harry had mortally offended him explain georgewell when we were in our first year harry young carefree and innocent harry snorted he doubted whether fred and george had ever been innocentwell more innocent than we are now we got into a spot of bother with filchwe let off a dungbomb in the corridor and it upset him for some reason so he hauled us off to his office and started threatening us with the usual detention disembowelment and we couldnt help noticing a drawer in one of his filing cabinets marked confiscated and highly dangerousdont tell me said harry starting to grinwell what would youve done said fred george caused a diversion by dropping another dungbomb i whipped the drawer open and grabbed thisits not as bad as it sounds you know said george we dont reckon filch ever found out how to work it he probably suspected what it wasthough or he wouldnt have confiscated itand you know how to work itoh yes said fred smirking this little beautys taught us more than all the teachers in this schoolyoure winding me up said harry looking at the ragged old bit of parchmentoh are we said georgehe took out his wand touched the parchment lightly and said i solemnly swear that i am up to no goodand at once thin ink lines began to spread like a spiders web from the point that georges wand had touched they joined each other they crisscrossed they fanned into every corner of the parchment then words began to blossom across the top great curly green words that proclaimedmessrs moony wormtail padfoot and prongs purveyors of aids to magical mischief makers are proud to present the marauders map it was a map showing every detail of the hogwarts castle and groundsbut the truly remarkable thing were the tiny ink dots moving around iteach labeled with a name in minuscule writing astounded harry bent over it a labeled dot in the top left corner showed that professor dumbledore was pacing his study the caretakers cat mrs norris was prowling the second floor and peeves the poltergeist was currently bouncing around the trophy room and as harrys eyes traveled up and down the familiar corridors he noticed something elsethis map showed a set of passages he had never entered and many of them seemed to lead right into hogsmeade said fred tracing one of them with his fingerthere are seven in all now filch knows about these four he pointed them out but were sure were the only ones who know about these dont bother with the one behind the mirror on the fourth floorwe used it until last winter but its caved in completely blockedand we dont reckon anyones ever used this one because the whomping willows planted right over the entrance but this one here this one leads right into the cellar of honeydukes weve used it loads of timesand as you mightve noticed the entrance is right outside this roomthrough that one eyed old crones humpmoony wormtaill padfoot and prongs sighed george patting the heading of the map we owe them so muchnoble men working tirelessly to help a new generation of lawbreakerssaid fred solemnlyright said george briskly dont forget to wipe it after youve used it or anyone can read it fred said warninglyjust tap it again and say mischief managed and itll go blankso young harry said fred in an uncanny impersonation of percymind you behave yourselfsee you in honeydukes said george winkingthey left the room both smirking in a satisfied sort of wayharry stood there gazing at the miraculous map he watched the tiny ink mrs norris turn left and pause to sniff at something on the floor if filch really didnt know he wouldnt have to pass the dementors at allbut even as he stood there flooded with excitement something harry had once heard mr weasley say came floating out of his memorynever trust anything that can think for itself if you cant see where it keeps its brainthis map was one of those dangerous magical objects mr weasley had been warning against aids for magical mischief makers but then harry reasoned he only wanted to use it to get into hogsmeade it wasnt as though he wanted to steal anything or attack anyone and fred and george had been using it for years without anything horrible happeningharry traced the secret passage to honeydukes with his fingerthen quite suddenly as though following orders he rolled up the mapstuffed it inside his robes and hurried to the door of the classroomhe opened it a couple of inches there was no one outside very carefully he edged out of the room and behind the statue of theone eyed witchwhat did he have to do he pulled out the map again and saw to his astonishment that a new ink figure had appeared upon it labeled harry potter this figure was standing exactly where the real harry was standing about halfway down the third floor corridorharry watched carefully his little ink self appeared to be tapping the witch with his minute wand harry quickly took out his real wand and tapped the statue nothing happened he looked back at the map the tiniest speech bubble had appeared next to his figure the word inside said dissendiumdissendium harry whispered tapping the stone witch againat once the statues hump opened wide enough to admit a fairly thin person harry glanced quickly up and down the corridor then tucked the map away again hoisted himself into the hole headfirst and pushed himself forwardhe slid a considerable way down what felt like a stone slide then landed on cold damp earth he stood up looking around it was pitch dark he held up his wand muttered lumos and saw that he was in a very narrow low earthy passageway he raised the map tapped it with the tip of his wand and muttered mischief managed the map went blank at once he folded it carefully tucked it inside his robes thenheart beating fast both excited and apprehensive he set offthe passage twisted and turned more like the burrow of a giant rabbit than anything else harry hurried along it stumbling now and then on the uneven floor holding his wand out in front of himit took ages but harry had the thought of honeydukes to sustain himafter what felt like an hour the passage began to rise panting harry sped up his face hot his feet very coldten minutes later he came to the foot of some worn stone steps which rose out of sight above him careful not to make any noise harry began to climb a hundred steps two hundred steps he lost count as heclimbed watching his feet then without warning his head hit something hardit seemed to be a trapdoor harry stood there massaging the top of his head listening he couldnt hear any sounds above him very slowly he pushed the trapdoor open and peered over the edgehe was in a cellar which was full of wooden crates and boxes harry climbed out of the trapdoor and replaced it it blended so perfectly with the dusty floor that it was impossible to tell it was there harry crept slowly toward the wooden staircase that led upstairs now he could definitely hear voices not to mention the tinkle of a bell and the opening and shutting of a doorwondering what he ought to do he suddenly heard a door open much closer at hand somebody was about to come downstairsand get another box of jelly slugs dear theyve nearly cleaned us out said a womans voicea pair of feet was coming down the staircase harry leapt behind an enormous crate and waited for the footsteps to pass he heard the man shifting boxes against the opposite wall he might not get another chance quickly and silently harry dodged out from his hiding place and climbed the stairs looking back he saw an enormous backside and shiny bald head buried in a box harry reached the door at the top of the stairsslipped through it and found himself behind the counter of honeydukes he ducked crept sideways and then straightened uphoneydukes was so crowded with hogwarts students that no one looked twice at harry he edged among them looking around and suppressed a laugh as he imagined the look that would spread over dudleys piggy face if he could see where harry was nowthere were shelves upon shelves of the most succulent looking sweets imaginable creamy chunks of nougat shimmering pink squares of coconut ice fat honey colored toffees hundreds of different kinds of chocolate in neat rows there was a large barrel of every flavor beansand another of fizzing whizbees the levitating sherbert balls that ron had mentioned along yet another wall were special effects sweetsdroobles best blowing gum which filled a room with bluebell colored bubbles that refused to pop for days the strange splintery toothflossing stringmints tiny black pepper imps breathe fire for your friends ice mice hear your teeth chatter and squeakpeppermint creams shaped like toads hop realistically in the stomach fragile sugar spun quills and exploding bonbonsharry squeezed himself through a crowd of sixth years and saw a sign hanging in the farthest corner of the shop unusual tastes ron and hermione were standing underneath it examining a tray of blood flavored lollipops harry sneaked up behind themugh no harry wont want one of those theyre for vampires i expect hermione was sayinghow about these said ron shoving a jar of cockroach clusters under hermiones nosedefinitely not said harryron nearly dropped the jarharry squealed hermione what are you doing here how how did you wow said ron looking very impressed youve learned to apparatecourse i havent said harry he dropped his voice so that none of the sixth years could hear him and told them all about the marauders maphow come fred and george never gave it to me said ron outraged im their brotherbut harry isnt going to keep it said hermione as though the idea were ludicrous hes going to hand it in to professor mcgonagallarent you harryno im not said harryare you mad said ron goggling at hermione hand in something that goodif i hand it in ill have to say where i got it filch would know fred and george had nicked itbut what about sirius black hermione hissed he could be using one of the passages on that map to get into the castle the teachers have got to knowhe cant be getting in through a passage said harry quickly there are seven secret tunnels on the map right fred and george reckon filch already knows about four of them and of the other three one of thems caved in so no one can get through it one of thems got the whomping willow planted over the entrance so you cant get out of itand the one i just came through well its really hard to see the entrance to it down in the cellar so unless he knew it was thereharry hesistated what if black did know the passage was thereron however cleared his throat significantly and pointed to a notice pasted on the inside of the sweetshop doorby order of the ministry of magic customers are reminded that until further notice dementors will be patrolling the streets of hogsmeade every night after sundown this measure has been put in place for the safety of hogsmeade residents and will be lifted upon the recapture of sirius black it is therefore advisable that you complete your shopping well before nightfallmerry christmassee said ron quietly id like to see black

leading him over to their barrel and the jelly slugs and the acid pops fred gave me one of those when i was seven it burnt a hole right through my tongue i remember mum walloping him with her broomstick ron stared broodingly into the acid pop box reckon fredd take a bit of cockroach cluster if i told him they were peanutswhen ron and hermione had paid for all their sweets the three of them left honeydukes for the blizzard outsidehogsmeade looked like a christmas card the little thatched cottages and shops were all covered in a layer of crisp snow there were holly wreaths on the doors and strings of enchanted candles hanging in the treesharry shivered unlike the other two he didnt have his cloak they headed up the street heads bowed against the wind ron and hermione shouting through their scarvesthats the post office zonkos is up there we could go up to the shrieking shacktell you what said ron his teeth chattering shall we go for a butterbeer in the three broomsticksharry was more than willing the wind was fierce and his hands were freezing so they crossed the road and in a few minutes were entering the tiny innit was extremely crowded noisy warm and smoky a curvy sort of woman with a pretty face was serving a bunch of rowdy warlock up at the barthats madam rosmerta said ron ill get the drinks shall i he added going slightly redharry and hermione made their way to the back of the room her there was a small vacant table between the window and a handsome christmas tree which stood next to the fireplace ron came back five minutes later carrying three foaming tankards of hot butterbeermerry christmas he said happily raising his tankardharry drank deeply it was the most delicious thing hed ever tasted and seemed to heat every bit of him from the insidea sudden breeze ruffled his hair the door of the three broomsticks had opened again harry looked over the rim of his tankard and chokedprofessors mcgonagall and flitwick had just entered the pub with a flurry of snowflakes shortly followed by hagrid who was deep in conversation with a portly man in a lime green bowler hat and a pinstriped cloak cornelius fudge minister of magicin an instant ron and hermione had both placed hands on the top of harrys head and forced him off his stool and under the table dripping with butterbeer and crouching out of sight harry clutched his empty tankard and watched the teachers and fudges feet move toward the barpause then turn and walk right toward himsomewhere above him hermione whispered mobiliarbusthe christmas tree beside their table rose a few inches off the grounddrifted sideways and landed with a soft thump right in front of their table hiding them from view staring through the dense lower branchesharry saw four sets of chair legs move back from the table right beside theirs then heard the grunts and sighs if the teachers and minister as they sat downnext he saw another pair of feet wearing sparkly turquoise high heelsand heard a womans voice a small gillywater mine said professor mcgonagalls voicefour pints of mulled mead ta rosmerta said hagrida cherry syrup and soda with ice and umbrella mmm said professor flitwick smacking his lipsso youll be the red currant rum ministerthank you rosmerta mdear said fudges voice lovely to see you again i must say have one yourself wont you come and join uswell thank you very much ministerharry watched the glittering heels march away and back again his heart was pounding uncomfortably in his throat why hadnt it occurred to him that this was the last weekend of term for the teachers to& and how long were they going to sit there he needed time to sneak back into honeydukes if he wanted to return to school tonight hermiones leg gave a nervous twitch next to himso what brings you to this neck of the woods minister came madam rosmertas voiceharry saw the lower part of fudges thick body twist in his chair as though he were checking for eavesdroppers then he said in a quiet voice what else mdear but sirius black i daresay you heard whathappened up at the school at halloweeni did hear a rumor admitted madam rosmertadid you tell the whole pub hagrid said professor mcgonagall exasperatedlydo you think blacks still in the area minister whispered madam rosmertaim sure of it said fudge shortlyyou know that the dementors have searched the whole village twjcesaid madam rosmerta a slight edge to her voice scared all my customers away its very bad for business ministerrosmerta dear i dont like them any more than you do said fudge uncomfortably necessary precaution unfortunate but there you are ive just met some of them theyre in a fury against dumbledore he wont let them inside the castle groundsi should think not said professor mcgonagall sharply how are we supposed to teach with those horrors floating aroundhear hear squeaked tiny professor flitwick whose feet were dangling a foot from the groundall the same demurred fudge they are here to protect you all from something much worse we all know what blacks capable ofdo you know i still have trouble believing it said madam rosmerta thoughtfully of all the people to go over to the dark side sirius black was the last id have thought i mean i remember him when he was a boy at hogwarts if youd told me then what he was going to become id have said youd had too much meadyou dont know the half of it rosmerta said fudge gruffly the worst he did isnt widely knownthe worst said madam rosmerta her voice alive with curiosity worsethan murdering all those poor people you meani certainly do said fudgei caa believe that what could possibly be worse you say you remember him at hogwarts rosmerta mur mured professor mcgonagalldo you remember who his best friend wasnaturally said madam rosmerta with a small laugh never saw one without the other did you the number of times i had them in here ooh they used to make me laugh quite the double act sirius black and james potterharry dropped his tankard with a loud clunk ron kicked himprecisely said professor mcgonagall black and potter ringleaders of their little gang both very bright of course exceptionally bright in fact but i dont think weve ever had such a pair of troublemakers i dunno chuckled hagrid fred and george weasley could give em a run fer their moneyyoud have thought black and potter were brothers chimed in professor flitwick inseparableof course they were said fudge potter trusted black beyond all his other friends nothing changed when they left school black was best man when james married lily then they named him godfather to harry harry has no idea of course you can imagine how the idea would torment himbecause black turned out to be in league with you know who whispered madam rosmertaworse even than that rndear fudge dropped his voice and proceeded in a sort of low rumble not many people are aware that the potters knew you know who was after them dumbledore who was of course working tirelessly against you know who had a number of useful spiesone of them tipped him off and he alerted james and lily at once he advised them to go into hiding well of course you know who wasnt aneasy person to hide from dumbledore told them that their best chance was the fidelius charmhow does that work said madam rosmerta breathless with interestprofessor flitwick cleared his throatan immensely complex spell he said squeakily involving the magical concealment of a secret inside a single living soul the information is hidden inside the chosen person or secret keeper and is henceforth impossible to find unless of course the secret keeper chooses to divulge it as long as the secret keeper refused to speak you know who could search the village where lily and james were staying for years and never find them not even if he had his nose pressed against their sitting room windowso black was the potters secret keeper whispered madam rosmertanaturally said professor mcgonagall james potter told dumbledore that black would die rather than tell where they were that black was planning to go into hiding himself and yet dumbledore remained worried i remember him offering to be the potters secret keeper himselfhe suspected black gasped madam rosmertahe was sure that somebody close to the potters had been keeping you know who informed of their movements said professor mcgonagall darkly indeed he had suspected for some time that someone on our side had turned traitor and was passing a lot of information to you know whobut james potter insisted on using blackhe did said fudge heavily and then barely a week after the fidelius charm had been performed black betrayed them breathed madam rosmertahe did indeed black was tired of his double agent role he was ready to declare his support openly for you know who and he seems to have planned this for the moment of the potters death but as we all knowyou know who met his downfall in little harry potter powers gonehorribly weakened he fled and this left black in a very nasty position indeed his master had fallen at the very moment when he black had shown his true colors as a traitor he had no choice but to run for it filthy stinkin turncoat hagrid said so loudly that half the bar went quietshh said professor mcgonagalli met him growled hagrid i musta bin the last ter see him before he killed all them people it was me what rescued harry from lily an jamess house after they was killed jus got him outta the ruins poor little thing with a great slash across his forehead an his parents dead an sirius black turns up on that flyin motorbike he used ter ride never occurred ter me what he was doin there i didn know hed bin lily an jamess secret keeper thought hed jus heard the news o you know whos attack an come ter see what he could do white an shakin he was an yeh know what i did i comforted the murderin traitor hagrid roaredhagrid please said professor mcgonagall keep your voice downhow was i ter know he wasn upset abou lily an james it was you know who he cared abou an then he says give harry ter mehagrid im his godfather ill look after him ha but id had me orders from dumbledore an i told black no dumbledore said harry was ter go ter his aunt an uncles black argued but in the end he gave in told me ter take his motorbike ter get harry there i wont need it anymore he saysi shoulda known there was somethin fishy goin on then he loved that motorbike what was he givin it ter me for why wouldn he need it anymore fact was it was too easy ter trace dumbledore knew hed bin the potters secret keeper black knew he was goin ter have ter run fer it that night knew it was a matter o hours before the ministry was after himbut what if id given harry to him eh i bet hed ve pitched him offthe bike halfway out ter sea his bes friends son but when a wizard goes over ter the dark side theres nothin and no one that matters to em anymorea long silence followed hagrids story then madam rosmerta said with some satisfaction but he didnt manage to disappear did he the ministry of magic caught up with him next dayalas if only we had said fudge bitterly it was not we who found him it was little peter pettigrew another of the potters friendsmaddened by grief no doubt and knowing that black had been the potters secret keeper he went after black himselfpettigrew that fat little boy who was always tagging around after them at hogwarts said madam rosmertahero worshipped black and potter said professor mcgonagall never quite in their league talent wise i was often rather harp with himyou can imagine how i how i regret that now she sounded as though she had a sudden head coldthere now minerva said fudge kindly pettigrew died a heros death eyewitnesses muggles of course we wiped their memories later told us how pettigrew cornered black they say he was sobbinglily and james sirius how could you and then he went for his wandwell of course black was quicker blew pettigrew to smithereensprofessor mcgonagall blew her nose and said thickly stupid boy foolish boy he was always hopeless at dueling should have left it to the ministryi tell yeh if id got ter black before little pettigrew did i wouldnt ve messed around with wands id ve ripped him limb from limb hagrid growledyou dont know what youre talking about hagrid said fudge sharplynobody but trained hit wizards from the magical law enforcement squad would have stood a chance against black once he was cornered i was junior minister in the department of magical catastrophes at the timeand i was one of the first on the scene after black murdered all thosepeople i i will never forget it i still dream about it sometimes a crater in the middle of the street so deep it had cracked the sewer below bodies everywhere muggles screaming and black standing there laughing with what was left of pettigrew in front of him a heap of bloodstained robes and a few a few fragments fudges voice stopped abruptly there was the sound of five noses being blownwell there you have it rosmerta said fudge thickly black was taken away by twenty members of the magical law enforcement squad and pettigrew received the order of merlin first class which i think was some comfort to his poor mother blades been in azkaban ever sincemadam rosmerta let out a long sighis it true hes mad ministeri wish i could say that he was said fudge slowly i certainly believe his masters defeat unhinged him for a while the murder of pettigrew and all those muggles was the action of a cornered and desperate man cruel pointless yet i met black on my last inspection of azkaban you know most of the prisoners in there sit muttering to themselves in the dark theres no sense in them but i was shocked at how normal black seemed he spoke quite rationally to meit was unnerving youd have thought he was merely bored asked if id finished with my newspaper cool as you please said he missed doing the crossword yes i was astounded at how little effect the dementors seemed to be having on him and he was one of the most heavily guarded in the place you know dementors outside his door day and nightbut what do you think hes broken out to do said madam rosmertagood gracious minister he isnt trying to rejoin you know who is hei daresay that is his er eventual plan said fudge evasivelybut we hope to catch black long before that i must say you know who alone and friendless is one thing but give him back his most devoted servant and i shudder to think how quickly hell rise againthere was a small chink of glass on wood someone had set down their glassyou know cornelius if youre dining with the headmaster hed better head back up to the castle said professor mcgonagallone by one the pairs of feet in front of harry took the weight of their owners once more hems of cloaks swung into sight and madam rosemertas glittering heels disappeared behind the bar the door of the three broomsticks opened again there was another flurry of snow and the teachers had disappearedharryrons and hermiones faces appeared under the table they were both staring at him lost for wordschapter eleven the fireboltharry didnt have a very clear idea of how he had managed to get back into the honeydukes cellar through the tunnel and into the castle once more all he knew was that the return trip seemed to take no time at all and that he hardly noticed what he was doing because his head was still pounding with the conversation he had just heardwhy had nobody ever told him dumbledore hagrid mr weasley cornelius fudge why hadnt anyone ever mentioned the fact that harrys parents had died because their best friend had betrayed themron and herinione watched harry nervously all through dintier not daring to talk about what theyd overheard because percy was sitting close by them when they went upstairs to the crowded common room it was to find fred and george had set off half a dozen dungbombs in a fit of end of term high spirits harry who didnt want fred and george asking him whether hed reached hogsmeade or not sneaked quietly up to the empty dormitory and headed straight for his bedside cabinet he pushed his books aside and quickly found what he was looking for the leather bound photo album hagrid had given him two years ago which wasfull of wizard pictures of his mother and father he sat down on his bed drew the hangings around him and started turning the pagessearching untilhe stopped on a picture of his parents wedding day there was his father waving up at him beaming the untidy black hair harry had inherited standing up in all directions there was his mother alight with happiness arm in arm with his dad and there that must be himtheir best man harry had never given him a thought beforeif he hadnt known it was the same person he would never have guessed it was black in this old photograph his face wasnt sunken and waxybut handsome full of laughter had he already been working for voldemort when this picture had been taken was he already planning the deaths of the two people next to him did he realize he was facing twelve years in azkaban twelve years that would make him unrecognizablebut the dementors dont affect him harry thought staring into the handsome laughing face he doesnt have to hear my min screaming if they get too close harry slammed the album shut reached over and stuffed it back into his cabinet took off his robe and glasses and got into bed making sure the hangings were hiding him from viewthe dormitory door openedharry said rons voice uncertainlybut harry still pretending to be asleep he heard ron leave again and rolled over on his back his eyes wide opena hatred such as he had never known before was coursing through harry like poison he could see black laughing at him through the darkness as though somebody had pasted the picture from the album over his eyes he watched as though somebody was playing him a piece of film sirius black blasting peter pettigrew who resembled neville longbottom into a thousand pieces he could hear though having no idea what blacks voice might sound like a low excited mutter it has happened my lordthe potters have made me their secret keeper and then came another voice laughing shrilly the same laugh that harry heard inside his head whenever the dementors drew nearharry you you look terribleharry hadnt gotten to sleep until daybreak he had awoken to find the dormitory deserted dressed and gone down the spiral staircase to a common room that was completely empty except for ron who was eating a peppermint toad and massaging his stomach and hermione who had spread her homework over three tableswhere is everyone said harrygone its the first day of the holidays remember said ron watching harry closely its nearly lunchtime i was going to come and wake you up in a minuteharry slumped into a chair next to the fire snow was still falling outside the windows crookshanks was spread out in front of the fire like a large ginger rugyou really don look well you know hermione said peering anxiously into his faceim fine said harryharry listen said hermione exchanging a look with ron you must be really upset about what we heard yesterday but the thing is you mustnt go doing anything stupidlike what said harrylike trying to go after black said ron sharplyharry could tell they had rehearsed this conversation while he had been asleep he didnt say anythingyou wont will you harry said hermionebecause blacks not worth dying for said ronharry looked at them they didnt seem to understand at alldyou know what i see and hear every time a dementor gets too near meron and hermione shook their heads looking apprehensive i can hear my mum screaming and pleading with voldemort and if youd heard your mum screaming like that just about to be killed you wouldnt forget it in a hurry and if you found out someone who was supposed to be a friend of hers betrayed her and sent voldemort after her theres nothing you can do said hermione looking stricken the dementors will catch black and hell go back to azkaban and and serve him rightyou heard what fudge said black isnt affected by azkaban like normal people are its not a punishment for him like it is for the othersso what are you saying said ron looking very tense you want to to kill black or somethingdont be silly said herinione in a panicky voice harry doesnt want to kill anyone do you harryagain harry didnt answer he didnt know what he wanted to do all he knew was that the idea of doing nothing while black was at liberty was almost more than he could standmalfoy knows he said abruptly remember what he said to me in potions if it was me id hunt him down myself id want revengeyoure going to take malfoys advice instead of ours said ron furiously listen you know what pettigrews mother got back after black had finished with him dad told me the order of merlin first class and pettigrews finger in a box that was the biggest bit of him they could find blacks a madman harry and hes dangerous malfoys dad must have told him said harry ignoring ron he was right in voldemorts inner circle say you know who will you interjected ron angrilyso obviously the malfoys knew black was working for voldemort and malfoyd love to see you blown into about a million pieces like pettigrew get a grip malfoys just hoping youll get yourself killed before he has to play you at quidditchharry please said hermione her eyes now shining with tears please be sensible black did a terrible terrible thing but d dont put yourself in danger its what black wants oh harry youd be playing right into blacks hands if you went looking for him your mum and dad wouldnt want you to get hurt would they theyd never want you to go looking for blackill never know what theyd have wanted because thanks to black ive never spoken to them said harry shortlythere was a silence in which crookshanks stretched luxuriously flexing his claws rons pocket quiveredlook said ron obviously casting around for a change of subjectits the holidays its nearly christmas lets lets go down and see hagrid we havent visited him for agesno said hermione quickly harry isnt supposed to leave the castleron yeah lets go said harry sitting up and i can ask him how come he never mentioned black when he told me all about my parentsfurther discussion of sirius black plainly wasnt what ron had had in mindor we could have a game of chess he said hastily or gobstones percy left a set no lets visit hagrid said harry firmlyso they got their cloaks from their dormitories and set off through theportrait hole stand and fight you yellow bellied mongrels down through the empty castle and out through the oak front doorsthey made their way slowly down the lawn making a shallow trench in the glittering powdery snow their socks and the hems of their cloaks soaked and freezing the forbidden forest looked as though it had been enchanted each tree smattered with silver and hagrids cabin looked like an iced cakeron knocked but there was no answerhes not out is he said hermione who was shivering under her cloakron had his ear to the doortheres a weird noise he said listen is that fangharry and hermione put their ears to the door too from inside the cabin came a series of low throbbing moansthink wed better go and get someone said ron nervouslyhagrid called harry thumping the door hagrid are you in therethere was a sound of heavy footsteps then the door creaked open hagrid stood there with his eyes red and swollen tears splashing down the front of his leather vestywve heard he bellowed and he flung himself onto harrys neckhagrid being at least twice the size of a normal man this was no laughing matter harry about to collapse under hagrids weight was rescued by ron and hermione who each seized hagrid under an arm and heaved him back into the cabin hagrid allowed himself to be steered into a chair and slumped over the table sobbing uncontrollably his face glazed with tears that dripped down into his tangled beardhagrid what is it said hermione aghastharry spotted an official looking letter lying open on the tablewhats this hagridhagrids sobs redoubled but he shoved the letter toward harry who picked it up and read alouddear mr hagridfurther to our inquiry into the attack by a hippogriff on a student in your class we have accepted the assurances of professor dumbledore that you bear no responsibility for the regrettable incidentwell thats okay then hagrid said ron clapping hagrid oil the shoulder but hagrid continued to sob and waved one of his gigantic hands inviting harry to read onhowever we must register our concern about the hippogriff in questionwe have decided to uphold the official complaint of mr lucius malfoyand this matter will therefore be taken to the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures the hearing will take place on april th and we ask you to present yourself and your hippogriff at the committees offices in london on that date in the meantime the hippogriff should be kept tethered and isolated yours in fellowshipthere followed a list of the school governorsoh said ron but you said buckbeak isnt a bad hippogriff hagrid i bet hell get off yeh don know them gargoyles at the committee fer the disposal o dangerous creatures choked hagrid wiping his eyes on his sleevetheyve got it in fer interestin creaturesa sudden sound from the corner of hagrids cabin made harry ron and hermione whip around buckbeak the hippogriff was lying in the cornerchomping on something that was oozing blood all over the floori couldn leave him tied up out there in the snow choked hagrid all on his own at christmasharry ron and hermione looked at one another they had never seen eye to eye with hagrid about what he called interesting creatures and other people called terrifying monsters or the other hand there didnt seem to be any particular harm in buckbeak in fact by hagrids usual standards he was positively cuteyoull have to put up a good strong defense hagrid said hermionesitting down and laying a hand on hagrids massive forearm im sure you can prove buckbeak is safewont make no diffrence sobbed hagrid

in his armswhat about dumbledore hagrid said harryhes done moren enough fer me already groaned hagrid got enough on his plate what with keepin them dementors outta the castle an sirius black lurkin around ron and hermione looked quickly at harry as though expecting him to start berating hagrid for not telling him the truth about black but harry couldnt bring himself to do it not now that he saw hagrid so miserable and scaredlisten hagrid he said you cant give up hermiones right you just need a good defense you can call us as witnesses im sure ive read about a case of hippogriff baiting said hermione thoughtfully where the hippogriff got off ill look it up for youhagrid and see exactly what happenedhagrid howled still more loudly harry and hermione looked at ron to help themer shall i make a cup of tea said ronharry stared at himits what my mum does whenever someones upset ron mutteredshruggingat last after many more assurances of help with a steaming mug of tea in front of him hagrid blew his nose on a handkerchief the size of a tablecloth and said yer right i can afford to go ter pieces gotta pull meself togetherfang the boarhound came timidly out from under the table and laid his head on hagrids kneeive not bin meself lately said hagrid stroking fang with one hand and mopping his face with the other worried abou buckbeak an no one likin me classes we do like them lied

gotta go inter hidin an an im scared o breakin the law he looked up at them tears leaking down his face again i don ever want ter go back ter azkabanthe trip to hagrids though far from fun had nevertheless had the effect ron and hermione had hoped though harry had by no means forgotten about black he couldnt brood constantly on revenge if he wanted to help hagrid win his case against the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures he ron and hermione went to the library the next day and returned to the empty common room laden with books that might help prepare a defense for buckbeak the three of them sat in front of the roaring fire slowly turning the pages of dusty volumes about famous cases if marauding beasts speaking occasionally when they ran across something relevantheres something there was a case in but the hippogriff was convicted ugh look what they did to it thats disgusting this might help look a manticore savaged someone in and they let the manticore off oh no that was only because everyone wastoo scared to go near itmeanwhile in the rest of the castle the usual magnificent christmas decorations had been put up despite the fact that hardly any of the students remained to enjoy them thick streamers of holly and mistletoe were strung along the corridors mysterious lights shone from inside every suit of armor and the great hall was filled with its usual twelve christmas trees glittering with golden stars a powerful and delicious smell of cooking pervaded the corridors and by christmas eve it had grown so strong that even scabbers poked his nose out of the shelter of rons pocket to sniff hopefully at the airon christmas morning harry was woken by ron throwing his pillow at himoy presentsharry reached for his glasses and put them on squinting through the semi darkness to the foot of his bed where a small heap of parcels had appeared ron was already ripping the paper off his own presentsanother sweater from mum maroon again see if youve got oneharry had mrs weasley had sent him a scarlet sweater with the gryffindor lion knitted on the front also a dozen home baked mince pies some christmas cake and a box of nut brittle as he moved all these things aside he saw a long thin package lying underneathwhats that said ron looking over a freshly unwrapped pair of maroon socks in his handdunnoharry ripped the parcel open and gasped as a magnificent gleaming broomstick rolled out onto his bedspread ron dropped his socks and jumped off his bed for a closer looki dont believe it he said hoarselyit was a firebolt identical to the dream broom harry had gone to see every day in diagon alley its handle glittered as he picked it up hecould feel it vibrating and let go it hung in midair unsupported at exactly the right height for him to mount it his eyes moved from the golden registration number at the top of the handle right down to the perfectly smooth streamlined birch twigs that made up the tailwho sent it to you said ron in a hushed voicelook and see if theres a card said harryron ripped apart the firebolts wrappingsnothing blimey whod spend that much on youwell said harry feeling stunned im betting it wasnt the dursleysi bet it was dumbledore said ron now walking around and around the firebolt taking in every glorious inch he sent you the invisibility cloak anonymouslythat was my dads though said harry dumbledore was just passing it on to me he wouldnt spend hundreds of galleons on me he cant go giving students stuff like this thats why he wouldnt say it was from him said ron in case some git like malfoy said it was favoritism hey harry ron gave a great whoop of laughter malfoy wait till he sees you on this hell be sick as a pig this is an international standard broom this isi cant believe this harry muttered running a hand along the firebolt while ron sank onto harrys bed laughing his head off at the thought of malfoy who i know said ron controlling himself i know who it couldve been lupinwhat said harry now starting to laugh himself lupin listen if he had this much gold hed be able to buy himself some new robesyeah but he likes you said ron and he was away when your nimbusgot smashed and he mightve heard about it and decided to visit diagon alley and get this for you what dyou mean he was away said harry he was ill when i was playing in that matchwell he wasnt in the hospital wing said ron i was there cleaning out the bedpans on that detention from snape rememberharry frowned at roni cant see lupin affording something like thiswhatre you two laughing abouthermione had just come in wearing her dressing gown and carrying crookshanks who was looking very grumpy with a string of tinsel tied around his neckdont bring him in here said ron hurriedly snatching scabbers from the depths of his bed and stowing him in his pajama pocketbut hermione wasnt listening she dropped crookshanks onto seamuss empty bed and stared open mouthed at the fireboltoh harry who sent you thatno idea said harry there wasnt a card or anything with itto his great surprise hermione did not appear either excited or intrigued by the news on the contrary her face fell and she bit her lipwhats the matter with you said roni dont know said hermione slowly but its a bit odd isnt it i mean this is supposed to be quite a good broom isnt itron sighed exasperatedlyits the best broom there is hermione he saidso it mustve been really expensiveprobably cost more than all the slytherins brooms put together said ron happilywell whod send harry something as expensive as that and not even tell him theyd sent it said hermionewho cares said ron impatiently listen harry can i have a go on it can ii dont think anyone should ride that broom just yet said hermione shrillyharry and ron looked at herwhat dyou think harrys going to do with it sweep the floor said ronbut before hermione could answer crookshanks sprang from seamuss bedright at rons chestget him out of here ron bellowed as crookshankss claws ripped his pajamas and scabbers attempted a wild escape over his shoulder ron seized scabbers by the tail and aimed a misjudged kick at crookshanks that hit the trunk at the end of harrys bed knocking it over and causing ron to hop up and down howling with paincrookshankss fur suddenly stood on end a shrill tint whistling was filling the room the pocket sneakoscope had become dislodged from uncle vernons old socks and was whirling and gleaming on the floori forgot about that harry said bending down and picking up the sneakoscope i never wear those socks if i can help itthe sneakoscope whirled and whistled in his palm crookshanks was hissing and spitting at ityoud better take that cat out of here hermione said ron furiouslysitting on harrys bed nursing his toe cant you shut that thing uphe added to harry as hermione strode out of the room crookshankss yellow eyes still fixed maliciously on ronharry stuffed the sneakoscope back inside the socks and threw it back into his trunk all that could be heard now were rons stifled moans of pain and rage scabbers was huddled in rons hands it had been a while since harry had seen him out of rons pocket and he was unpleasantly surprised to see that scabbers once so fat was now very skinny patches of fur seemed to have fallen out too hes not looking too good is he harry saidits stress said ron hed be fine if that big stupid furball left him alonebut harry remembering what the woman at the magical menagerie had said about rats living only three years couldnt help feeling that unless scabbers had powers he had never revealed he was reaching the end of his life and despite rons frequent conplaints that scabbers was both boring and useless he was sure ron would be very miserable if scabbers diedchristmas spirit was definitely thin on the ground in the gryffindor common room that morning hermione had shut crookshanks in her dormitory but was furious with ron for trying to kick him ron was still fuming about crookshankss fresh attempt to eat scabbers harry gave up trying to make them talk to each other and devoted himself to examining the firebolt which he had brought down to the common room with him for some reason this seemed to annoy hermione as well she didnt say anything but she kept looking darkly at the broom as though it too had been criticizing her catat lunchtime they went down to the great hall to find that the house tables had been moved against the walls again and that a single tableset for twelve stood in the middle of the room professors dumbledoremcgonagall snape sprout and flitwick were there along with filchthe caretaker who had taken off his usual brown coat and was wearing a very old and rather moldy looking tailcoat there were only three otherstudents two extremely nervous looking first years and a sullen faced slytherin fifth yearmerry christmas said dumbledore as harry ron and hermione approached the table as there are so few of us it seemed foolish to use the house tables sit down sit downharry ron and hermione sat down side by side at the end of the tablecrackers said dumbledore enthusiastically offering the end of a large silver noisemaker to snape who took it reluctantly and tuggedwith a bang like a gunshot the cracker flew apart to reveal a largepointed witchs hat topped with a stuffed vultureharry remembering the boggart caught rons eye and they both grinned snapes mouth thinned and he pushed the hat toward dumbledore who swapped it for his wizards hat at oncedig in he advised the table beaming aroundas harry was helping himself to roast potatoes the doors of the great hall opened again it was professor trelawney gliding toward them as though on wheels she had put on a green sequined dress in honor of the occasion making her look more than ever like a glittering oversized dragonflysibyll this is a pleasant surprise said dumbledore standing upi have been crystal gazing headmaster said professor trelawney in her mistiest most faraway voice and to my astonishment i saw myself abandoning my solitary luncheon and coming to join you who am i to refuse the promptings of fate i at once hastened from my tower and i do beg you to forgive my latenesscertainly certainly said dumbledore his eyes twinkling let me draw you up a chair and he did indeed draw a chair in midair with his wand which revolved for a few seconds before falling with a thud between professors snape and mcgonagall professor trelawney however did not sit down herenormous eyes had been roving around the table and she suddenly uttered a kind of soft screami dare not headmaster if i join the table we shall be thirteennothing could be more unlucky never forget that when thirteen dine together the first to rise will be the first to diewell risk it sibyll said professor mcgonagall inpatiendy do sit down the turkeys getting stone coldprofessor trelawney hesitated then lowered herself into the empty chair eyes shut and mouth clenched tight as though expecting a thunderbolt to hit the table professor mcgonagall poked a large spoon into the nearest tureentripe sibyllprofessor trelawney ignored her eyes open again she looked around once more and said but where is dear professor lupinim afraid the poor fellow is ill again said dumbledore indicating that everybody should start serving themselves most unfortunate that it should happen on christmas daybut surely you already knew that sibyll said professor mcgonagallher eyebrows raisedprofessor trelawney gave professor mcgonagall a very cold lookcertainly i knew minerva she said quietly but one does not parade the fact that one is all knowing i frequently act as though i am not possessed of the inner eye so as not to make others nervousthat explains a great deal said professor mcgonagall tartlyprofessor trelawneys voice suddenly became a good deal less mistyif you must know minerva i have seen that poor professor lupin will not be with us for very long he seems aware himself that his time is short he positively fled when i offered to crystal gaze for him imagine that said professor mcgonagall drylyi doubt said dumbledore in a cheerful but slightly raised voicewhich put an end to professor mcgonagall and professor trelawneys conversation that professor lupin is in any immediate danger severusyouve made the potion for him againyes headmaster said snape w what said harry scrambling to his feet whyit will need to be checked for jinxes said professor mcgonagall of course im no expert but i daresay madam hooch and professor flitwick will strip it down strip it down repeated ron as though professor mcgonagall was madit shouldnt take more than a few weeks said professor mcgonagallyou will have it back if we are sure it is jinx freetheres nothing wrong with it said harry his voice shaking slightlyhonestly professor you cant know that potter said professor mcgonagall quite kindlynot until youve flown it at any rate and im afraid that is out of the question until we are certain that it has not been tampered with i shall keep you informedprofessor mcgonagall turned on her heel and carried the firebolt out of the portrait hole which closed behind her harry stood staring after her the tin of high finish polish still clutched in his hands ronhowever rounded on hermionewhat did you go running to mcgonagall forhermione threw her book aside she was still pink in the face but stood up and faced ron defiantlybecause i thought and professor mcgonagall agrees with me that that broom was probably sent to harry by sirius blackchapter twelve the patronusharry knew that hermione had meant well but that didnt stop him from being angry with her he had been the owner of the best broom in the world for a few short hours and now because of her interference he didnt know whether he would ever see it again he was positive that there was nothing wrong with the firebolt now but what sort of state would it be in once it had been subjected to all sorts of anti jinx testsron was furious with hermione too as far as he was concerned the stripping down of a brand new firebolt was nothing less than criminal damage hermione who remained convinced that she had acted for the best started avoiding the common room harry and ron supposed she had taken refuge in the library and didnt try to persuade her to come backall in all they were glad when the rest of the school returned shortly after new year and gryffindor tower became crowded and noisy againwood sought harry out on the night before term startedhad a good christmas he said and then without waiting for an answer he sat down lowered his voice and said ive been doing some thinking over christmas harry after last match you know if the dementors come to the next one i mean we cant afford you to well wood broke off looking awkwardim working on it said harry quickly professor lupin said hed train me to ward off the dementors we should be starting this week he said hed have time after christmasah said wood his expression clearing well in that case i really didnt want to lose you as seeker harry and have you ordered a new broom yetno said harrywhat youd better get a move on you know you cant ride that shooting star against ravenclawhe got a firebolt for christmas said rona firebolt no seriously a a real fireboltdont get excited oliver said harry gloomily i havent got it anymore it was confiscated and he explained all about how the firebolt was now being checked for jinxesjinxed how could it be jinxedsirius black harry said wearily hes supposed to be after me so mcgonagall reckons he might have sent itwaving aside the information that a famous murderer was after his seeker wood said but black couldnt have bought a firebolt hes on the run the whole countrys on the lookout for him how could he just walk into quality quidditch supplies and buy a broomsticki know said harry but mcgonagall still wants to strip it down wood went paleill go and talk to her harry he promised ill make her see reason a firebolt a real firebolt on our team she wants gryffindor to win as much as we do ill make her see sense a fireboltclasses started again the next day the last thing anyone felt like doing was spending two hours on the grounds on a raw january morningbut hagrid had provided a bonfire full of salamanders for their enjoyment and they spent an unusually good lesson collecting dry wood and leaves to keep the fire blazing while the flame loving lizards scampered up and down the crumbling white hot logs the first divination lesson of the new term was much less fun professor trelawney was now teaching them palmistry and she lost no time in informing harry that he had the shortest life line she had ever seenit was defense against the dark arts that harry was keen to get to after his conversation with wood he wanted to get started on his anti dementor lessons as soon as possibleah yes said lupin when harry reminded him of his promise at the end of class let me see how about eight oclock on thursday eveningthe history of magic classroom should be large enough ill have to think carefully about how were going to do this we cant bring a real dementor into the castle to practice onstill looks ill doesnt he said ron as they walked down the corridor heading to dinner what dyou reckons the matter with himthere was a loud and impatient tuh from behind them it was hermionewho had been sitting at the feet of a suit of armor repacking her bagwhich was so full of books it wouldnt closeand what are you tutting at us for said ron irritablynothing said hermione in a lofty voice heaving her bag back over her shoulderyes you were said ron i said i wonder whats wrong with lupin and you well isnt it obvious said hermione with a look of maddening superiorityif you dont want to tell us dont snapped ronfine said hermione haughtily and she marched offshe doesnt know said ron staring resentfully after hermione shes just trying to get us to talk to her againat eight oclock on thursday evening harry left gryffindor tower for the history of magic classroom it was dark and empty when he arrivedbut he lit the lamps with his wand and had waited only five minutes when professor lupin turned up carrying a large packing case which he heaved onto professor binns deskwhats that said harryanother boggart said lupin stripping off his cloak ive been combing the castle ever since tuesday and very luckily i found this one lurking inside mr filchs filing cabinet its the nearest well get to a real dementor the boggart will turn into a dementor when he sees you so well be able to practice on him i can store him in my office when were not using him theres a cupboard under my desk hell likeokay said harry trying to sound as though he wasnt apprehensive at all and merely glad that lupin had found such a good substitute for a real dementorso professor lupin had taken out his own wand and indicated that harry should do the same the spell i am going to try and teach you is highly advanced magic harry well beyond ordinary wizarding level it is called the patronus charmhow does it work said harry nervouslywell when it works correctly it conjures up a patronus said lupinwhich is a kind of anti dementor a guardian that acts as a shield between you and the dementorharry had a sudden vision of himself crouching behind a hagridsized figure holding a large club professor lupin continued the patronus is a kind of positive force a projection of the very things that the dementor feeds upon hope happiness the desire to survive but it cannot feel despair as real humans can so the dementors cant hurt itbut i must warn you harry that the charm might be too advanced for you many qualified wizards have difficulty with itwhat does a patronus look like said harry curiouslyeach one is unique to the wizard who conjures itand how do you conjure itwith an incantation which will work only if you are concentratingwith all your might on a single very happy memoryharry cast his mind about for a happy memory certainly nothing that had happened to him at the dursleys was going to do finally he settled on the moment when he had first ridden a broomstickright he said trying to recall as exactly as possible the wonderfulsoaring sensation of his stomachthe incantation is this lupin cleared his throat expecto patronumexpecto patronum harry repeated under his breath expecto patronumconcentrating hard on your happy memoryoh yeah said harry quickly forcing his thoughts back to that first broom ride expecto patrono no patronum sorry expecto patronum expecto patronumsomething whooshed suddenly out of the end of his wand it looked like a wisp of silvery gasdid you see that said harry excitedly something happenedvery good said lupin smiling right then ready to try it on a dementoryes harry said gripping his wand very tightly and moving into the middle of the deserted classroom he tried to keep his mind on flyingbut something else kept intruding any second now he might hear his mother again but he shouldnt think that or he would hear her againand he didnt want to or did helupin grasped the lid of the packing case and pulleda dementor rose slowly from the box its hooded face turned toward harry one glistening scabbed hand gripping its cloak the lamps aroundthe classroom flickered and went out the dementor stepped from the box and started to sweep silently toward harry drawing a deep rattling breath a wave of piercing cold broke over him expecto patronum harry yelled expecto patronum expecto but the classroom and the dementor were dissolving harry was failing again through thick white fog and his mothers voice was louder than ever echoing inside his head not harry not harry please ill do anythingstand aside stand aside girlharryharry jerked back to life he was lying flat on his back on the floorthe classroom lamps were alight again he didnt have to ask what had happenedsorry he muttered sitting up and feeling cold sweat trickling down behind his glassesare you all right said lupinyes harry pulled himself up on one of the desks and leaned against ithere lupin handed him a chocolate frog eat this before we try again i didnt expect you to do it your first time in fact i would have been astounded if you hadits getting worse harry muttered biting off the frogs head i could hear her louder that time and him voldemort lupin looked paler than usual harry if you dont want to continue i will more than understand i do said harry fiercely stuffing the rest of the chocolate frog into his mouth ive got to what if the dementors turn up at our matchagainst ravenclaw i cant afford to fall off again if we lose this game weve lost the quidditch cupall right then said lupin you might want to select other memory a happy memory i mean to concentrate on that one doesnt seem to have been strong enoughharry thought hard and decided his feelings when gryffindor had won the house championship last year had definitely qualified as very happy he gripped his wand tightly again and took up his position in the middle of the classroomready said lupin gripping the box lidready said harry trying hard to fill his head with happy thoughts about gryffindor winning and not dark thoughts about what was going to happen when the box openedgo said lupin pulling off the lid the room went icily cold and dark once more the dementor glided forward drawing its breath one rotting hand was extending toward harry expecto patronum harry yelled expecto patronum expecto pat white fog obscured his senses big blurred shapes were moving around him then came a new voice a mans voice shouting panicking lily take harry and go its him go run ill hold him off the sounds of someone stumbling ftom a room a door bursting open a cackle of high pitched laughter harry harry wake uplupin was tapping harry hard on the face this time it was a minute before harry understood why he was lying on a dusty classroom floori heard my dad harry mumbled thats the first time ive ever heard him he tried to take on voldemort himself to give my mum time to run for itharry suddenly realized that there were tears on his face mingling with the sweat he bent his face as low as possible wiping them off on his robes pretending to do up his shoelace so that lupin wouldnt seeyou heard james said lupin in a strange voiceyeah face dry harry looked up why you didnt know my dad did youi i did as a matter of fact said lupin we were friends at hogwarts listen harry perhaps we should leave it here for tonightthis charm is ridiculously advanced i shoulnt have suggested putting you through thisno said harry he got up again ill have one more go im not thinking of happy enough things thats what it is hang onhe racked his brains a really really happy memory one that he could turn into a good strong patronusthe moment when hed first found out he was a wizard and would be leaving the dursleys for hogwarts if that wasnt a happy memory he didnt know what was concentrating very hard on how he had felt when hed realized hed be leaving privet drive harry got to his feet and faced the packing case once moreready said lupin who looked as though he were doing this against his better judgment concentrating hard all right gohe pulled off the lid of the case for the third time and the dementor rose out of it the room fell cold and dark expecto patronum harry bellowed expecto patronumexpecto patronumthe screaming inside harrys head had started again except this timeit sounded as though it were coming from a badly tuned radio softer and louder and softer again and he could still see the dementor ithad halted and then a huge silver shadow came bursting out of the end of harrys wand to hover between him and the dementor and though harrys legs felt like water he was still on his feet though for how much longer he wasnt sure riddikulus roared lupin springing forwardthere was a loud crack and harrys cloudy patronus vanished along with the dementor he sank into a chair feeling as exhausted as if hed just run a mile and felt his legs shaking out of the corner of his eye he saw professor lupin forcing the boggart back into the packing case with his wand it had turned into a silvery orb againexcellent lupin said striding over to where harry sat excellentharry that was definitely a startcan we have another go just one more gonot now said lupin firmly youve had enough for one night here he handed harry a large bar of honeydukes best chocolateeat the lot or madam pomfrey will be after my blood same time next weekokay said harry he took a bite of the chocolate and watched lupin extinguishing the lamps that had rekindled with the disappearance of the dementor a thought had just occurred to himprofessor lupin he said if you knew my dad you mustve known sirius black as welllupin turned very quicklywhat gives you that idea he said sharplynothing i mean i just knew they were friends at hogwarts toolupins face relaxedyes i knew him he said shortly or i thought i did youd better be off harry its getting lateharry left the classroom walking along the corridor and around a corner then took a detour behind a suit of armor and sank down on its plinth to finish his chocolate wishing he hadnt mentioned black as lupin was obviously not keen on the subject then harrys thoughts wandered back to his mother and fatherhe felt drained and strangely empty even though he was so full of chocolate terrible though it was to hear his parents last moments replayed inside his head these were the only times harry had heard their voices since he was a very small child but hed never be able to produce a proper patronus if he half wanted to hear his parents againtheyre dead he told himself sternly theyre dead and listening to echoes of them wont bring them back youd better get a grip on yourself if you want that quidditch cuphe stood up crammed the last bit of chocolate into his mouth and headed back to gryffindor towerravenclaw played slytherin a week after the start of term slytherin won though narrowly according to wood this was good news for gryffindor who would take second place if they beat ravenclaw too he therefore increased the number of team practices to five a leek this meant that with lupins anti dementor classes which in themselves were more draining than six quidditch practices harry had just one night a week to do all his homework even so he was showing the strain nearly as much as hermione whose immense workload finally seemed to be getting to her every night without fail hermione was to be seen in a corner of the common room several tables spread with books arithmancy chartsrune dictionaries diagrams of muggles lifting heavy objects and file upon file of extensive notes she barely spoke to anybody and snapped when she was interruptedhows she doing it ron muttered to harry one evening as harry sat finishing a nasty essay on undetectable poisons for snape harry looked up hermione was barely visible behind a tottering pile of booksdoing whatgetting to all her classes ron said i heard her talking to professor vector that arithmancy witch this morning they were going on about yesterdays lesson but hermione cant ve been there because she was with us in care of magical creatures and ernie mcmillan told me shes never missed a muggle studies class but half of them are at the same time as divination and shes never missed one of them eitherharry didnt have time to fathom the mystery of hermiones impossible schedule at the moment he really needed to get on with snapes essaytwo seconds later however he was interrupted again this time by woodbad news harry ive just been to see professor mcgonagall about the firebolt she er got a bit shirty with me told m id got my priorities wrong seemed to think i cared more about winning the cup than i do about you staying alive just because i told her i didnt care if it threw you off as long as you caught the snitch first wood shook his head in disbelief honestly the way she was yelling at me youd think id said something terrible then i asked her how much longer she was going to keep it he screwed up his face and imitated professor mcgonagalls severe voice as long as necessary wood i reckon its time you ordered a new broom harry theres an order form at the back of which broomstick you could get a nimbus two thousand and one like malfoys gotim not buying anything malfoy thinks is good said harry flatlyjanuary faded imperceptibly into february with no change in the bitterly cold weather the match against ravenclaw was drawing nearer and nearer but harry still hadnt ordered a new broom he was now asking professor mcgonagall for news of the firebolt after every transfiguration lesson ron standing hopefully at his shoulder hermione rushing past with her face avertedno potter you cant have it back yet professor mcgonagall told him the twelfth time this happened before hed even opened his mouthweve checked for most of the usual curses but professor flitwick believes the broom might be carrying a hurling hex i shall tell youonce weve finished checking it now please stop badgering meto make matters even worse harrys anti dementor lessons were not going nearly as well as he had hoped several sessions on he was able to produce an indistinct silvery shadow every time the boggart dementor approached him but his patronus was too feeble to drive the dementor away all it did was hover like a semitransparent cloud draining harry of energy as he fought to keep it there harry felt angry with himselfguilty about his secret desire to hear his parents voices againyoure expecting too much of yourself said professor lupin sternly in their fourth week of practice for a thirteen year old wizard even an indistinct patronus is a huge achievement you arent passing out anymore are youi thought a patronus would charge the dementors down or somethingsaid harry dispiritedly make them disappear the true patronus does do that said lupin but youve achieved a great deal in a very short space of time if the dementors put in an appearance at your next quidditch match you will be able to keep them at bay long enough to get back to the groundyou said its harder if there are loads of them said harryi have complete confidence in you said lupin smiling here youve earned a drink something from the three broomsticks you wont have tried it before he pulled two bottles out of his briefcasebutterbeer said harry without thinking yeah i like that stufflupin raised an eyebrowoh ron and hermione brought me some back from hogsmeade harry lied quicklyi see said lupin though he still looked slightly suspicious well lets drink to a gryffindor victory against ravenclaw not that imsupposed to take sides as a teacher he added hastily they drank the butterbeer in silence until harry voiced something hed been wondering for a whilewhats under a dementors hoodprofessor lupin lowered his bottle thoughtfullyhmmm well the only people who really know are in no condition to tell us you see the dementor lowers its hood only to use its last and worst weaponwhats thatthey call it the dementors kiss said lupin with a slightly twisted smile its what dementors do to those they wish to destroy utterly i suppose there must be some kind of mouth under there because they clamp their jaws upon the mouth of the victim and and suck out his soulharry accidentally spat out a bit of butterbeerwhat they kill oh no said lupin much worse than that you can exist without your soul you know as long as your brain and heart are still working but youll have no sense of self anymore no memory no anythingtheres no chance at all of recovery youll just exist as an empty shell and your soul is gone forever lostlupin drank a little more butterbeer then said its the fate that awaits sirius black it was in the daily prophet this morning the ministry have given the dementors permission to perform it if they find himharry sat stunned for a moment at the idea of someone having their soul sucked out through their mouth but then he thought of blackhe deserves it he said suddenlyyou think so said lupin lightly do you really think anyone deserves thatyes said harry defiantly for for some thingshe would have liked to have told lupin about the conversation hed overheard about black in the three broomsticks about black betraying his mother and father but it would have involved revealing that hed gone to hogsmeade without permission and he knew lupin wouldnt be very impressed by that so he finished his butterbeer thanked lupin and left the history of magic classroomharry half wished that he hadnt asked what was under a dementors hoodthe answer had been so horrible and he was so lost in unpleasant thoughts of what it would feel like to have your soul sucked out of you that he walked headlong into professor mcgonagall halfway up the stairsdo watch where youre going pottersorry professor ive just been looking for you in the gryffindor common room wellhere it is weve done everything we could think of and there doesnt seem to be anything wrong with it at all youve got a very good friend somewhere potterharrys jaw dropped she was holding out his firebolt and it looked as magnificent as everi can have it back harry said weakly seriouslyseriously said professor mcgonagall and she was actually smiling i daresay youll need to get the feel of it before saturdays match wont you and potter do try and win wont you or well be out of the running for the eighth year in a row as professor snape was kind enough to remind me only last nightspeechless harry carried the firebolt back upstairs toward gryffindor tower as he turned a corner he saw ron dashing toward him grinning from ear to earshe gave it to you excellent listen can i still have a go on ittomorrowyeah anything said harry his heart lighter than it had been in a month you know what we should make up with hermione she was only trying to helpyeah all right said ron shes in the common room how working for a change they turned into the corridor to gryffindor tower and saw neville longbottom pleading with sir cadogan who seemed to be refusing him entrancei wrote them down neville was saying tearfully but i mustve dropped them somewherea likely tale roared sir cadogan then spotting harry and ron good even my fine young yeomen come clap this loon in irons he is trying to force entry to the chambers withinoh shut up said ron as he and harry drew level with nevilleive lost the passwords neville told them miserably i made him tell me what passwords he was going to use this week because he keeps changing them and now i dont know what ive done with themoddsbodikins said harry to sir cadogan who looked extremely disappointed and reluctantly swung forward to let them into the common room there was a sudden excited murmur as every head turned and the next moment harry was surrounded by people exclaiming over his fireboltwhered you get it harrywill you let me have a go have you ridden it yet harryravenclawll have no chance theyre all on cleansweep sevenscan i just hold it harryafter ten minutes or so during which the firebolt was passed around and admired from every angle the crowd dispersed and harry and ron had a clear view of hermione the only person who hadnt rushed over to thembent over her work and carefully avoiding their eyes harry and ron approached her table and at last she looked upi got it back said harry grinning at her and holding up the fireboltsee hermione there wasnt anything wrong with it said ronwell there might have been said hermione i mean at least you know now that its safeyeah i suppose so said harry id better put it upstairsill take it said ron eagerly ive got to give scabbers his rat toniche took the firebolt and holding it as if it were made of glasscarried it away up the boys staircasecan i sit down then harry asked hermionei suppose so said hermione moving a great stack of parchment off a chairharry looked around at the cluttered table at the long arithmancy essay on which the ink was still glistening at the even longer muggle studies essay explain why muggles need electricity and at the rune translation hermione was now poring overhow are you getting through all this stuff harry asked heroh well you know working hard said hermione close up harry saw that she looked almost as tired as lupinwhy dont you just drop a couple of subjects harry asked watchingher lifting books as she searched for her rune dictionaryi couldnt do that said hermione looking scandalizedarithmancy looks terrible said harry picking up a very complicated looking number chartoh no its wonderful said hermione earnestly its my favorite subject its but exactly what was wonderful about arithmancy harry never found outat that precise moment a strangled yell echoed down the boys staircase the whole common room fell silent staring petrified at the entrance then came hurried footsteps growing louder and louder and then ron came leaping into view dragging with him a bedsheetlook he bellowed striding over to hermiones tablelook he yelled shaking the sheets in her faceron what scabbers look scabbershermione was leaning away from ron looking utterly bewildered harry looked down at the sheet ron was holding there was something red on itsomething that looked horribly like blood ron yelled into the stunned silence hes gone and you know what was on the floorn no said hermione in a trembling voiceron threw something down onto hermiones rune translation hermione and harry leaned forward lying on top of the weird spiky shapes were several long ginger cat hairschapter thirteen gryffindor versus ravenclawit looked like the end of ron and hermiones friendship each was so angry with the other that harry couldnt see how theyd ever make upron was enraged that hermione had never taken crookshankss attempts to eat scabbers seriously hadnt bothered to keep a close enough watch on him and was still trying to pretend that crookshanks was innocent by suggesting that ron look for scabbers under all the boys bedshermione meanwhile maintained fiercely that ron had no proof that crookshanks had eaten scabbers that the ginger hairs might have been there since christmas and that ron had been prejudiced against her cat ever since crookshanks had landed on rons head in the magical menageriepersonally harry was sure that crookshanks had eaten scabbers and when he tried to point out to hermione that the evidence all pointed that way she lost her temper with harry toookay side with ron i knew you would she said shrilly first the firebolt now scabbers everythings my fault isnt it just leave me alone harry ive got a lot of work to doron had taken the loss of his rat very hard indeedcome on ron you were always saying how boring scabbers was said fred bracingly and hes been off color for ages he was wasting awayit was probably better for him to snuff it quickly one swallow he probably didnt feel a thingfred said ginny indignantlyall he did was eat and sleep ron you said it yourself said georgehe bit goyle for us once ron said miserably remember harryyeah thats true said harryhis finest hour said fred unable to keep a straight face let the scar on goyles finger stand as a lasting tribute to his memory ohcome on ron get yourself down to hogsmeade and buy a new rat whats the point of moaningin a last ditch attempt to cheer ron up harry persuaded him to come along to the gryffindor teams final practice before the ravenclaw match so that he could have a ride on the firebolt after theyd finished this did seem to take rons mind off scabbers for a moment great can i try and shoot a few goals on it so they set off for the quidditch field togethermadam hooch who was still overseeing gryffindor practices to keep an eye on harry was just as impressed with the firebolt as everyone else had been she took it in her hands before takeoff and gave them the benefit of her professional opinionlook at the balance on it if the nimbus series has a fault its a slight list to the tail end you often find they develop a drag after a few years theyve updated the handle too a bit slimmer than the cleansweeps reminds me of the old silver arrows a pity theyve stopped making them i learned to fly on one and a very fine old broom it was tooshe continued in this vein for some time until wood said er madam hooch is it okay if harry has the firebolt back we need to practiceoh right here you are then potter said madam hooch ill sit over here with weasleyshe and ron left the field to sit in the stadium and the gryffindor team gathered around wood for his final instructions for tomorrows matchharry ive just found out who ravenclaw is playing as seeker its cho chang shes a fourth year and shes pretty good i really hoped she wouldnt be fit shes had some problems with injuries wood scowled his displeasure that cho chang had made a full recovery then said on the other hand she rides a comet two sixty which is going to look like a joke next to the firebolt he gave harrys broom a look of fervent admiration then said okay everyone lets go and at long last harry mounted his firebolt and kicked off from the groundit was better than hed ever dreamed the firebolt turned with the lightest touch it seemed to obey his thoughts rather than his grip it sped across the field at such speed that the stadium turned into a green and gray blur harry turned it so sharply that alicia spinnet screamed then he went into a perfectly controlled dive brushing the grassy field with his toes before rising thirty forty fifty feet into the air againharry im letting the snitch out wood calledharry turned and raced a bludger toward the goal posts he outstripped it easily saw the snitch dart out from behind wood and within ten seconds had caught it tightly in his handthe team cheered madly harry let the snitch go again gave it a minutes head start then tore after it weaving in and out of the others he spotted it lurking near katie bells knee looped her easilyand caught it againit was the best practice ever the team inspired by the presence of the firebolt in their midst performed their best moves faultlessly and by the time they hit the ground again wood didnt have a single criticism to make which as george weasley pointed out was a firsti cant see whats going to stop us tomorrow said wood not unless harry youve sorted out your dementor problem havent youyeah said harry thinking of his feeble patronus and wishing it were strongerthe dementors wont turn up again oliver dumbledored go ballisticsaid fred confidentlywell lets hope not said wood anyway good work everyone lets get back to the tower turn in early im staying out for a bit ron wants a go on the firebolt harry told wood and while the rest of the team headed off to the locker roomsharry strode over to ron who vaulted the barrier to the stands and came to meet him madam hooch had fallen asleep in her seathere you go said harry handing ron the fireboltron an expression of ecstasy on his face mounted the broom and zoomed off into the gathering darkness while harry walked around the edge of the field watching him night had fallen before madam hooch awoke with a start told harry and ron off for not waking her and insisted that they go back to the castleharry shouldered the firebolt and he and ron walked out of the shadowy stadium discussing the firebolts superbly smooth action its phenomenal acceleration and its pinpoint turning they were halfway toward the castle when harry glancing to his left saw something that made his heart turn over a pair of eyes gleaming out of the darknessharry stopped dead his heart banging against his ribswhats the matter said ronharry pointed ron pulled out his wand and muttered lumosa beam of light fell across the grass hit the bottom of a tree and illuminated its branches there crouching among the budding leaves was crookshanksget out of here ron roared and he stooped down and seized a stone lying on the grass but before he could do anything else crookshanks had vanished with one swish of his long ginger tailsee ron said furiously chucking the stone down again shes still letting him wander about wherever he wants probably washing down scabbers with a couple of birds nowharry didnt say anything he took a deep breath as relief seeped through him he had been sure for a moment that those eyes had belongedto the grim they set off for the castle once more slightly ashamed of his moment of panic harry didnt say anything to ron nor did he look left or right until they had reached the well lit entrance hallharry went down to breakfast the next morning with the rest of the boys in his dormitory all of whom seemed to think the firebolt deserved a sort of guard of honor as harry entered the great hall heads turned in the direction of the firebolt and there was a good deal of excited muttering harry saw with enormous satisfaction that the slytherin team were all looking thunderstruckdid you see his face said ron gleefully looking back at malfay he cant believe it this is brilliantwood too was basking in the reflected glory of the fireboltput it here harry he said laying the broom in the middle of the table and carefully turning it so that its name faced upward people from the ravenclaw and hufflepuff tables were soon coming over to lookcedric diggory came over to congratulate harry on having acquired such a superb replacement for his nimbus and percys ravenclaw girlfriendpenelope clearwater asked if she could actually hold the fireboltnow now penny no sabotage said percy heartily as she examined the firebolt closely penelope and i have got a bet on he told the teamten galleons on the outcome of the matchpenelope put the firebolt down again thanked harry and went back to her tableharry make sure you win said percy in an urgent whisper i havent got ten galleons yes im coming penny and he bustled off to join her in a piece of toastsure you can manage that broom potter said a cold drawling voicedraco malfoy had arrived for a closer look crabbe and coyle right behind himyeah reckon so said harry casuallygot plenty of special features hasnt it said malfoy eyes glittering maliciously shame it doesnt come with a parachute in case you get too near a dementorcrabbe and goyle sniggeredpity you cant attach an extra arm to yours malfoy said harry then it could catch the snitch for youthe gryffindor team laughed loudly malfoys pale eyes narrowed and he stalked away they watched him rejoin the rest of the slytherin teamwho put their heads together no doubt asking malfoy whether harrys broom really was a fireboltat a quarter to eleven the gryffindor team set off for the locker rooms the weather couldnt have been more different from their match against hufflepuff it was a clear cool day with a very light breeze there would be no visibility problems this time and harry though nervous was starting to feel the excitement only a quidditch match could bring they could hear the rest of the school moving into the stadium beyond harry took off his black school robes removed his wand from his pocket and stuck it inside the t shirt he was going to wear under his quidditch robes he only hoped he wouldnt need it he wondered suddenly whether professor lupin was in the crowd watchingyou know what weve got to do said wood as they prepared to leave the locker rooms if we lose this match were out of the running just just fly like you did in practice yesterday and well be okaythey walked out onto the field to tumultuous applause the ravenclaw team dressed in blue were already standing in the middle of the fieldtheir seeker cho chang was the only girl on their team she was shorter than harry by about a head and harry couldnt help noticingnervous as he was that she was extremely pretty she smiled at harry as the teams faced each other behind their captains and he felt a slight lurch in the region of his stomach that he didnt think had anything to do with nerveswood davies shake hands madam hooch said briskly and wood shookhands with the ravenclaw captainmount your brooms on my whistle three two one harry kicked off into the air and the firebolt zoomed higher and faster than any other broom he soared around the stadium and began squinting around for the snitch listening all the while to the commentary which was being provided by the weasley twins friend lee jordantheyre off and the big excitement this match is the firebolt that harry potter is flying for gryffindor according to which broomstickthe firebolts going to be the broom of choice for the national teams at this years world championship jordan would you mind telling us whats going on in the matchinterrupted professor mcgonagalls voiceright you are professor just giving a bit of background information the firebolt incidentally has a built in auto brake and jordanokay okay gryffindor in possession katie bell of gryffindor heading for goalharry streaked past katie in the opposite direction gazing around for a glint of gold and noticing that cho chang was tailing him closely she was undoubtedly a very good flier she kept cutting across himforcing him to change directionshow her your acceleration harry fred yelled as he whooshed past in pursuit of a bludger that was aiming for aliciaharry urged the firebolt forward as they rounded the ravenclaw goal posts and cho fell behind just as katie succeeded in scoring the first goal of the match and the gryffindor end of the field went wild he saw it the snitch was close to the ground flitting near one of the barriersharry dived cho saw what he was doing and tore after him harry wasspeeding up excitement flooding him dives were his speciality he was ten feet away then a bludger hit by one of the ravenclaw beaters came pelting out of nowhere harry veered off course avoiding it by an inch and in those few crucial seconds the snitch had vanishedthere was a great ooooooh of disappointment from the gryffindor supporters but much applause for their beater from the ravenclaw endgeorge weasley vented his feelings by hitting the second bludger directly at the offending beater who was forced to roll right over in midair to avoid itgryffindor leads by eighty points to zero and look at that firebolt go potters really putting it through its paces now see it turn changs comet is just no match for it the firebolts precision balance is really noticeable in these long jordan are you being paid to advertise firebolts get on with the commentaryravenclaw was pulling back they had now scored three goals which put gryffindor only fifty points ahead if cho got the snitch before himravenclaw would win harry dropped lower narrowly avoiding a ravenclaw chaser scanning the field frantically a glint of gold a flutter of tiny wings the snitch was circling the gryffindor goal post harry accelerated eyes fixed on the speck of gold ahead but just then cho appeared out of thin air blocking him harry this is no time to be a gentleman wood roared as harry swerved to avoid a collision knock her off her broom if you have toharry turned and caught sight of cho she was grinning the snitch had vanished again harry turned his firebolt upward and was soon twenty feet above the game out of the corner of his eye he saw cho following him shed decided to mark him rather than search for the snitch herself all right then if she wanted to tail him shed have totake the consequenceshe dived again and cho thinking hed seen the snitch tried to follow harry pulled out of the dive very sharply she hurtled downward he rose fast as a bullet once more and then saw it for the third time the snitch was glittering way above the field at the ravenclaw endhe accelerated so many feet below did cho he was winning gaining on the snitch with every second then oh screamed cho pointingdistracted harry looked downthree dementors three tall black hooded dementors were looking up at himhe didnt stop to think plunging a hand down the neck of his robes he whipped out his wand and roared expecto patronumsomething silver white something enormous erupted from the end of his wand he knew it had shot directly at the dementors but didnt pause to watch his mind still miraculously clear he looked ahead he was nearly there he stretched out the hand still grasping his wand and just managed to close his fingers over the small struggling snitchmadam hoochs whistle sounded harry turned around in midair and saw six scarlet blurs bearing down on him next moment the whole team was hugging him so hard he was nearly pulled off his broom down below he could hear the roars of the gryffindors in the crowdthats my boy wood kept yelling alicia angelina and katie had all kissed harry fred had him in a grip so tight harry felt as though his head would come off in complete disarray the team managed to make its way back to the ground harry got off his broom and looked up to see a gaggle of gryffindor supporters sprinting onto the field ron in the lead before he knew it he had been engulfed by the cheering crowdyes ron yelled yanking harrys arm into the air yes yeswell done harry said percy looking delighted ten galleons to memust find penelope excuse me good for you harry roared seamus finniganruddy brilliant boomed hagrid over the heads of the milling gryffindorsthat was quite some patronus said a voice in harrys earharry turned around to see professor lupin who looked both shaken and pleasedthe dementors didnt affect me at all harry said excitedly i didnt feel a thingthat would be because they er werent dementors said professor lupin come and see he led harry out of the crowd until they were able to see the edge of the fieldyou gave mr malfoy quite a fright said lupinharry stared lying in a crumpled heap on the ground were malfoycrabbe goyle and marcus flint the slytherin team captain all struggling to remove themselves from long black hooded robes it looked as though malfoy had been standing on goyles shoulders standing over them with an expression of the utmost fury on her face was professor mcgonagallan unworthy trick she was shouting a low and cowardly attempt to sabotage the gryffindor seeker detention for all of you and fifty points from slytherin i shall be speaking to professor dumbledore about this make no mistake ah here he comes nowif anything could have set the seal on gryffindors victory it was this ron who had fought his way through to harrys side doubled up with laughter as they watched malfoy fighting to extricate himself from the robe goyles head still stuck inside itcome on harry said george fighting his way over party gryffindor common room nowright said harry and feeling happier than he had in ages he and the rest of the team led the way still in their scarlet robes out of the stadium and back up to the castleit felt as though they had already won the quidditch cup the party went on all day and well into the night fred and george weasley disappeared for a couple of hours and returned with armfuls of bottles of butterbeer pumpkin fizz and several bags full of honeydukes sweetshow did you do that squealed angelina johnson as george started throwing peppermint toads into the crowdwith a little help from moony wormtail padfoot and prongs fred muttered in harrys earonly one person wasnt joining in the festivities hermione incrediblywas sitting in a corner attempting to read an enormous book entitled home life and social habits of british muggles harry broke away from the table where fred and george had started juggling butterbeer bottles and went over to herdid you even come to the match he asked herof course i did said hermione in a strangely high pitched voice not looking up and im very glad we won and i think you did really wellbut i need to read this by mondaycome on hermione come and have some food harry said looking over at ron and wondering whether he was in a good enough mood to bury the hatcheti cant harry ive still got four hundred and twenty two pages to read said hermione now sounding slightly hysterical anyway she glanced over at ron too he doesnt want me to join inthere was no arguing with this as ron chose that moment to say loudlyif scabbers hadnt just been eaten he could have had some of those fudge flies he used to really like them hermione burst into tears before harry could say or do anything she tucked the enormous book under her arm and still sobbing ran toward the staircase to the girls dormitories and out of sightcant you give her a break harry asked ron quietlyno said ron flatly if she just acted like she was sorry but shell never admit shes wrong hermione shes still acting like scabbers has gone on vacation or somethingthe gryffindor party ended only when professor mcgonagall turned up in her tartan dressing gown and hair net at one in the morning to insist that they all go to bed harry and ron climbed the stairs to their dormitory still discussing the match at last exhausted harry climbed into bed twitched the hangings of his four poster shut to block out a ray of moonlight lay back and felt himself almost instantly drifting off to sleephe had a very strange dream he was walking through a forest his firebolt over his shoulder following something silvery white it was winding its way through the trees ahead and he could only catch glimpses of it between the leaves anxious to catch up with it he sped up but as he moved faster so did his quarry harry broke into a runand ahead he heard hooves gathering speed now he was running flat outand ahead he could hear galloping then he turned a corner into a clearing and aaarrgghh noooharry woke as suddenly as though hed been hit in the face disoriented in the total darkness he fumbled with his hangings he could hear movements around him and seamus finnigans voice from the other side of the room whats going onharry thought he heard the dormitory door slam at last finding the divide in his curtains he ripped them back and at the same momentdean thomas lit his lampron was sitting up in bed the hangings torn from one side a look of utmost terror on his faceblack sirius black with a knifewhathere just now slashed the curtains woke me upyou sure you werent dreaming ron said deanlook at the curtains i tell you he was herethey all scrambled out of bed harry reached the dormitory door firstand they sprinted back down the staircase doors opened behind them and sleepy voices called after themwho shoutedwhatre you doingthe common room was lit with the glow of the dying fire still littered with the debris from the party it was desertedare you sure you werent dreaming ronim telling you i saw himwhats all the noiseprofessor mcgonagall told us to go to beda few of the girls had come down their staircase pulling or dressing gowns and yawning boys too were reappearingexcellent are we carrying on said fred weasley brightlyeveryone back upstairs said percy hurrying into the common room and pinning his head boy badge to his pajamas as he spokeperce sirius black said ron faintly in our dormitory with a knife woke me upthe common room went very stillnonsense said percy looking startled you had too much to eat ron had a nightmare im telling you now really enoughs enoughprofessor mcgonagall was back she slammed the portrait behind her as she entered the common room and stared furiously aroundi am delighted that gryffindor won the match but this is getting ridiculous percy i expected better of youi certainly didnt authorize this professor said percy puffing himself up indignantly i was just telling them all to get back to bedmy brother ron here had a nightmare it wasnt a nightmare ron yelled professor i woke up and sirius black was standing over me holding a knifeprofessor mcgonagall stared at himdont be ridiculous weasley how could he possibly have gotten through the portrait holeask him said ron pointing a shaking finger at the back of sir cadogans picture ask him if he saw glaring suspiciously at ron professor mcgonagall pushed the portrait back open and went outside the whole common room listened with bated breath sir cadogan did you just let a man enter gryffindor towercertainly good lady cried sir cadoganthere was a stunned silence both inside and outside the common roomyou you did said professor mcgonagall but but the passwordhe had em said sir cadogan proudly had the whole weeks my ladyread em off a little piece of paperprofessor mcgonagall pulled herself back through the portrait hole to face the stunned crowd she was white as chalkwhich person she said her voice shaking which abysmally foolish person wrote down this weeks passwords and left them lying aroundthere was utter silence broken by the smallest of terrified squeaksneville longbottom trembling from head to fluffy slippered toes raised his hand slowly into the airchapter fourteen snapes grudgeno one in gryffindor tower slept that night they knew that the castle was being searched again and the whole house stayed awake in the common room waiting to hear whether black had been caught professor mcgonagall came back at dawn to tell them that he had again escapedthroughout the day everywhere they went they saw signs of tighter security professor flitwick could be seen teaching the front doors to recognize a large picture of sirius black filch was suddenly bustling up and down the corridors boarding up everything from tiny cracks in the walls to mouse holes sir cadogan had been fired his portrait had been taken back to its lonely landing on the seventh floor and the fat lady was back she had been expertly restored but was still extremely nervous and had agreed to return to her job only on condition that she was given extra protection a bunch of surly security trolls had been hired to guard her they paced the corridor in a menacing group talking in grunts and comparing the size of their clubsharry couldnt help noticing that the statue of the one eyed witch on the third floor remained unguarded and unblocked it seemed that fredand george had been right in thinking that they and now harry ronand hermione were the only ones who knew about the hidden passageway within itdyou reckon we should tell someone harry asked ronwe know hes not coming in through honeydukes said ron dismissivelywedve heard if the shop had been broken intoharry was glad ron took this view if the one eyed witch was boarded up too he would never be able to go into hogsmeade againron had become an instant celebrity for the first time in his lifepeople were paying more attention to him than to harry and it was clear that ron was rather enjoying the experience though still severely shaken by the nights events he was happy to tell anyone who asked what had happened with a wealth of detaili was asleep and i heard this ripping noise and i thought it was in my dream you know but then there was this draft i woke up and one side of the hangings on my bed had been pulled down i rolled over and i saw him standing over me like a skeleton with loads of filthy hair holding this great long knife mustve been twelve inches and he looked at me and i looked at him and then i yelledand he scamperedwhy though ron added to harry as the group of secondyear girls who had been listening to his chilling tale departed why did he runharry had been wondering the same thing why had black having got the wrong bed not silenced ron and proceeded to harry black had proved twelve years ago that he didnt mind murdering innocent people and this time he had been facing five unarmed boys four of whom were asleephe mustve known hed have a job getting back out of the castle once youd yelled and woken people up said harry thoughtfully hedve had to kill the whole house to get back through the portrait hole then he would ve met the teachersneville was in total disgrace professor mcgonagall was so furious withhim she had banned him from all future hogsmeade visits given him a detention and forbidden anyone to give him the password into the towerpoor neville was forced to wait outside the common room every night for somebody to let him in while the security trolls leered unpleasantly at him none of these punishments however came close to matching the one his grandmother had in store for him two days after blacks break inshe sent neville the very worst thing a hogwarts student could receive over breakfast a howlerthe school owls swooped into the great hall carrying the mail as usualand neville choked as a huge barn owl landed in front of him a scarlet envelope clutched in its beak harry and ron who were sitting opposite him recognized the letter as a howler at once ron had got one from his mother the year beforerun for it neville ron advisedneville didnt need telling twice he seized the envelope and holding it before him like a bomb sprinted out of the hall while the slytherin table exploded with laughter at the sight of him they heard the howler go off in the entrance hall nevilles grandmothers voice magically magnified to a hundred times its usual volume shrieking about how he had brought shame on the whole familyharry was too busy feeling sorry for neville to notice immediately that he had a letter too hedwig got his attention by nipping him sharply on the wristouch oh thanks hedwigharry tore open the envelope while hedwig helped herself to some of nevilles cornflakes the note inside saiddear harry and ron how abut having tea with me this afternoon round six ill come collect you from the castle wait for me in the entrance hall youre not allowed out on

the top of hagrids wardrobe doorwhat are they for hagrid said harrybuckbeaks case against the committee fer the disposal o dangerous creatures said hagrid this friday him an mell be goin down ter london together ive booked two beds on the knight busharry felt a nasty pang of guilt he had completely forgotten that buckbeaks trial was so near and judging by the uneasy look on rons face he had too they had also forgotten their promise about helping him prepare buckbeaks defense the arrival of the firebolt had driven it clean out of their mindshagrid poured them tea and offered them a plate of bath buns but they knew better than to accept they had had too much experience with hagrids cookingi got somethin ter discuss with you two said hagrid sitting himself between them and looking

up to the castlea large group of people was bunched around the bulletin board when they returned to the common roomhogsmeade next weekend said ron craning over the heads to read the new notice what dyou reckon he added quietly to harry as they went to sit downwell filch hasnt done anything about the passage into honeydukesharry said even more quietlyharry said a voice in his right ear harry started and looked around at hermione who was sitting at the table right behind them and clearing a space in the wall of books that had been hiding herharry if you go into hogsmeade again ill tell professor mcgonagall about that map said hermionecan you hear someone talking harry growled ron not looking at hermioneron how can you let him go with you after what sirius black nearly did to you i

lap hermione took one frightened look at the expression on rons face gathered up crookshanks and hurried away toward the girls dormitoriesso how about it ron said to harry as though there had been no interruption come on last time we went you didnt see anything you havent even been inside zonkos yetharry looked around to check that hermione was well out of earshotokay he said but im taking the invisibility cloak this timeon saturday morning harry packed his invisibility cloak in his bagslipped the marauders map into his pocket and went down to breakfast with everyone else hermione kept shooting suspicious looks down the table at him but he avoided her eye and was careful to let her see him walking back up the marble staircase in the entrance hall as everybody else proceeded to the front doorsbye harry called to ron see you when you get backron grinned and winkedharry hurried up to the third floor slipping the marauders map out of his pocket as he went crouching behind the one eyed witch he smoothed it out a tiny dot was moving in his direction harry squinted at itthe minuscule writing next to it read neville longbottomharry quickly pulled out his wand muttered dissendium and shoved his bag into the statue but before he could climb in himself neville came around the cornerharry i forgot you werent going to hogsmeade eitherhi neville said harry moving swiftly away from the statue and pushing the map back into his pocket what are you up tonothing shrugged neville want a game of exploding snaper not now i was going to go to the library and do that vampire essay for lupin ill come with you said neville brightly i havent done it eitherer hang on yeah i forgot i finished it last nightgreat you can help me said neville his round face anxious i dont understand that thing about the garlic at all do they have to eat itor he broke off with a small gasp looking over harrys shoulderit was snape neville took a quick step behind harryand what are you two doing here said snape coming to a halt and looking from one to the other an odd place to meet to harrys immense disquiet snapes black eyes flicked to the doorways on either side of them and then to the one eyed witchwere not meeting here said harry we just met hereindeed said snape you have a habit of turning up in unexpected places potter and you are very rarely there for no good reason i suggest the pair of you return to gryffindor tower where you belongharry and neville set off without another word as they turned the corner harry looked back snape was running one of his hands over the one eyed witchs head examining it closelyharry managed to shake neville off at the fat lady by telling him the password then pretending hed left his vampire essay in the library and doubling back once out of sight of the security trolls he pulled out the map again and held it close to his nosethe third floor corridor seemed to be deserted harry scanned the map carefully and saw with a leap of relief that the tiny dot labeled severus snape was now back in its officehe sprinted back to the one eyed witch opened her hump heaved himself inside and slid down to meet his bag at the bottom of the stone chutehe wiped the marauders map blank again then set off at a runharry completely hidden beneath the invisibility cloak emerged into the sunlight outside honeydukes and prodded ron in the backits me he mutteredwhat kept you ron hissedsnape was hanging aroundthey set off up the high streetwhere are you ron kept muttering out of the corner of his mouth are you still there this feels weirdthey went to the post office ron pretended to be checking the price of an owl to bill in egypt so that harry could have a good look around the owls sat hooting softly down at him at least three hundred of them from great grays right down to tiny little scops owls local deliveries only which were so small they could have sat in the palm of harrys handthen they visited zonkos which was so packed with students harry had to exercise great care not to tread on anyone and cause a panic there were jokes and tricks to fulfill even freds and georges wildest dreams harry gave ron whispered orders and passed him some gold from under the cloak they left zonkos with their money bags considerably lighter than they had been on entering but their pockets bulging with dungbombs hiccup sweets frog spawn soap and a nose biting teacup apiecethe day was fine and breezy and neither of them felt like staying indoors so they walked past the three broomsticks and climbed a slope to visit the shrieking shack the most haunted dwelling in britain it stood a little way above the rest of the village and even in daylight was slightly creepy with its boarded windows and dank overgrown gardeneven the hogwarts ghosts avoid it said ron as they leaned on the fence looking up at it i asked nearly headless nick he says hes heard a very rough crowd lives here no one can get in fred and george tried obviously but all the entrances are sealed shutharry feeling hot from their climb was just considering taking off the cloak for a few minutes when they heard voices nearby someone was climbing toward the house from the other side of the hill moments later malfoy had appeared followed closely by crabbe and goyle malfoywas speakingshould have an owl from father any time now he had to go to the hearing to tell them about my arm about how i couldnt use it for three monthscrabbe and goyle sniggeredi really wish i could hear that great hairy moron trying to defend himself theres no arm in im onest that hippogriffs as good as dead malfoy suddenly caught sight of ron his pale face split in a malevolent grinwhat are you doing weasleymalfoy looked up at the crumbling house behind ronsuppose youd love to live here wouldnt you weasley dreaming about having your own bedroom i heard your family all sleep in one room is that trueharry seized the back of rons robes to stop him from leaping on malfoyleave him to me he hissed in rons earthe opportunity was too perfect to miss harry crept silently around behind malfoy crabbe and goyle bent down and scooped a large handful of mud out of the pathwe were just discussing your friend hagrid malfoy said to ron just trying to imagine what hes saying to the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures dyou think hell cry when they cut off his hippogriffs splatmalfoys head jerked forward as the mud hit him his silverblond hair was suddenly dripping in muckwhat the ron had to hold onto the fence to keep himself standing he was laughing so hard malfoy crabbe and goyle spun stupidly on the spot staring wildly around malfoy trying to wipe his hair cleanwhat was that who did thatvery haunted up here isnt it said ron with the air of one commenting on the weathercrabbe and goyle were looking scared their bulging muscles were no use against ghosts malfoy was staring madly around at the deserted landscapeharry sneaked along the path where a particularly sloppy puddle yielded some foul smelling green sludgesplattercrabbe and goyle caught some this time goyle hopped furiously on the spot trying to rub it out of his small dull eyesit came from over there said malfoy wiping his face and staring at a spot some six feet to the left of harrycrabbe blundered forward his long arms outstretched like a zombieharry dodged around him picked up a stick and lobbed it at crabbes back harry doubled up with silent laughter as crabbe did a kind of pirouette in midair trying to see who had thrown it as ron was the only person crabbe could see it was ron he started toward but harry stuck out his leg crabbe stumbled and his huge flat foot caught the hem of harrys cloak harry felt a great tug then the cloak slid off his facefor a split second malfoy stared at himaaargh he yelled pointing at harrys head then he turned tail and ran at breakneck speed back down the hill crabbe and goyle behind himharry tugged the cloak up again but the damage was doneharry ron said stumbling forward and staring hopelessly at the point where harry had disappeared youd better run for it if malfoy tells anyone youd better get back to the castle quick see you later said harry and without another word he tore back down the path toward hogsmeadewould malfoy believe what he had seen would anyone believe malfoy nobody knew about the invisibility cloak nobody except dumbledore harrys stomach turned over dumbledore would know exactly what had happened if malfoy said any thing back into honeydukes back down the cellar steps across the stone floor through the trapdoor harry pulled off the cloak tucked it under his arm and ran flat out along the passage malfoy would get back first how long would it take him to find a teacher panting a sharp pain in his side harry didnt slow down until he reached the stone slide he would have to leave the cloak where it was it was too much of a giveaway in case malfoy had tipped off a teacher he hid it in a shadowy corner then started to climb fast as he could his sweaty hands slipping on the sides of the chute he reached the inside of the witchs hump tapped it with his wand stuck his head through and hoisted himself out the hump closed and just as harry jumped out from behind the statue he heard quick footsteps approachingit was snape he approached harry at a swift walk his black robes swishing then stopped in front of himso he saidthere was a look of surpressed triumph about him harry tried to look innocent all too aware of his sweaty face and his muddy hands which he quickly hid in his pocketscome with me potter said snapeharry followed him downstairs trying to wipe his hands clean on theinside of his robes without snape noticing they walked down the stairs to the dungeons and then into snapes officeharry had been in here only once before and he had been in very serious trouble then too snape had aquired a few more slimy horrible things in jars since last time all standing on shelves behind his desk glinting in the firelight and adding to the threatening atmospheresit said snapeharry sat snape however remained standingmr malfoy has just been to see me with a strange story potter said snapeharry didnt say anythinghe tells me that he was up by the shrieking shack when he ran into weasley apparently alonestill harry didnt speakmr malfoy states that he was standing talking to weasley when a large amount of mud hit him in the back of the head how do you think that could have happenedharry tried to look mildly surprisedi dont know professorsnapes eyes were boring into harrys it was exactly like trying to stare down a hippogriff harry tried hard not to blinkmr malfoy then saw an extraordinary apparition can you imagine what it might have been potterno said harry now trying to sound innocently curiousit was your head potter floating in midairthere was a long silencemaybe hed better go to madam pomfrey said harry if hes seeing things like what would your head have been doing in hogsmeade potter said snape softly your head is not allowed in hogsmeade no part of your body has permission to be in hogsmeadei know that said harry striving to keep his face free of guilt or fear it sounds like malfoys having hallucin malfoy is not having hallucinations snarled snape and he bent downa hand on each arm of harrys chair so that their faces were a foot apart if your head was in hogsmeade so was the rest of youive been up in gryffindor tower said harry like you told can anyone confirm thatharry didnt say anything snapes thin mouth curled into a horrible smileso he said straightening up again everyone from the minister of magic downward has been trying to keep famous harry potter safe from sirius black but famous harry potter is a law unto himself let the ordinary people worry about his safety famous harry potter goes where he wants to with no thought for the consequencesharry stayed silent snape was trying to provoke him into telling the truth he wasnt going to do it snape had no proof yethow extraordinarily like your father you are potter snape said suddenly his eyes glinting he too was exceedingly arrogant a small amount of talent on the quidditch field made him think he was a cut above the rest of us too strutting around the place with his friends and admirers the resemblance between you is uncannymy dad didnt strut said harry before he could stop himself and neither do iyour father didnt set much store by rules either snape went onpressing his advantage his thin face full of malice rules were for lesser mortals not quidditch cup winners his head was so swollen shut upharry was suddenly on his feet rage such as he had not felt since his last night in privet drive was coursing through him he didnt care that snapes face had gone rigid the black eyes flashing dangerouslywhat did you say to me potteri told you to shut up about my dad harry yelled i know the truthall right he saved your life dumbledore told me you wouldnt even be here if it wasnt for my dadsnapes sallow skin had gone the color of sour milkand did the headmaster tell you the circumstances in which your father saved my life he whispered or did he consider the details too unpleasant for precious potters delicate earsharry bit his lip he didnt know what had happened and didnt want to admit it but snape seemed to have guessed the truthi would hate for you to run away with a false idea of your fatherpotter he said a terrible grin twisting his face have you been imagining some act of glorious heroism then let me correct you your saintly father and his friends played a highly amusing joke on me that would have resulted in my death if your father hadnt got cold feet at the last moment there was nothing brave about what he did he was saving his own skin as much as mine had their joke succeeded he would have been expelled from hogwartssnapes uneven yellowish teeth were baredturn out your pockets potter he spat suddenlyharry didnt move there was a pounding in his earsturn out your pockets or we go straight to the headmaster pull them out pottercold with dread harry slowly pulled out the bag of zonkos tricks and the marauders mapsnap picked up the zonkos bagron gave them to me said harry praying hed get a chance to tip ron off before snape saw him he brought them back from hogsmeade last time indeed and youve been carrying them around ever since how very touching and what is thissnape had picked up the map harry tried with all his might to keep his face impassivespare bit of parchment he said with a shrugsnape turned it over his eyes on harrysurely you dont need such a very old piece of parchment he saidwhy dont i just throw this awayhis hand moved toward the fireno harry said quicklyso said snape his long nostrils quivering is this another treasured gift from mr weasley or is it something else a letterperhaps written in invisible ink or instructions to get into hogsmeade without passing the dementorsharry blinked snapes eyes gleamedlet me see let me see he muttered taking out his wand and smoothing the map out on his desk reveal your secret he said touching the wand to the parchmentnothing happened harry clenched his hands to stop them from shakingshow yourself snape said tapping the map sharplyit stayed blank harry was taking deep calming breathsprofessor severus snape master of this school commands you to yield the information you conceal snape said hitting the map with his wandas though an invisible hand were writing upon it words appeared on the smooth surface of the mapmooney presents his compliments to professor snape and begs him to keep his abnormally large nose out of other peoples businesssnape froze harry stared dumbstruck at the message but the map didnt stop there more writing was appearing beneath the firstmr prongs agrees with mr moony and would like to add that professor snape is an ugle gitit would have been very funny if the situation hadnt been so seriousand there was moremr padfoot would like to register his astonishment that an idiot like that ever became a professorharry closed his eyes in horror when hed opened them the map had had its last wordmr wormtail bids professor snape good day and advises him to wash his hair the slimeballharry waited for the blow to fallso said snape softly well see about thishe strode across to his fire seized a fistful of glittering powder from a jar on the fireplace and threw it into the flameslupin snape called into the fire i want a wordutterly bewildered harry stared at the fire a large shape had appeared in it revolving very fast seconds later professor lupin was clambering out of the fireplace brushing ash off his shabby robesyou called severus said lupin mildlyi certainly did said snape his face contorted with fury as he strode back to his desk i have just asked potter to empty his pockets he was carrying thissnape pointed at the parchment on which the words of messrs moonywormtail padfoot and prongs were still shining an odd closed expression appeared on lupins facewell said snapelupin continued to stare at the map harry had the impression that lupin was doing some very quick thinkingwell said snape again this parchment is plainly full of dark magicthis is supposed to be your area of expertise lupin where do you imagine potter got such a thinglupin looked up and by the merest half glance in harrys directionwarned him not to interruptfull of dark magic he repeated mildly do you really think soseverus it looks to me as though it is merely a piece of parchment that insults anybody who reads it childish but surely not dangerous i imagine harry got it from a joke shop indeed said snape his jaw had gone rigid with anger you think a joke shop could supply him with such a thing you dont think it more likely that he got it directly from the manufacturersharry didnt understand what snape was talking about nor apparentlydid lupinyou mean by mr wormtail or one of these people he said harry do you know any of these menno said harry quicklyyou see severus said lupin turning back to snape it looks like a zonko product to me right on cue ron came bursting into the office he was completely out of breath and stopped just short of snapes desk clutching the stitch in his chest and trying to speaki gave harry that stuff he choked bought it in zonkos ages agowell said lupin clapping his hands together and looking around cheerfully that seems to clear that up severus ill take this backshall i he folded the map and tucked it inside his robes harry roncome with me i need a word about my vampire essay excuse us severus harry didnt dare look at snape as they left his office he ron and lupin walked all the way back into the entrance hall before speakingthen harry turned to lupinprofessor i i dont want to hear explanations said lupin shortly he glanced around the empty entrance hall and lowered his voice i happen to know that this map was confiscated by mr filch many years ago yes i know it s a map he said as harry and ron looked amazed i dont want to know how it fell into your possession i am however astounded that you didnt hand it in particularly after what happened the last time a student left information about the castle lying around and i cant let you have it back harryharry had expected that and was too keen for explanations to protestwhy did snape think id got it from the manufacturersbecause lupin hesitated because these mapmakers would have wanted to lure you out of school theyd think it extremely entertainingdo you know them said harry impressedweve met he said shortly he was looking at harry more seriously than ever beforedont expect me to cover up for you again harry i cannot make you take sirius black seriously but i would have thought that what you have heard when the dementors draw near you would have had more of an effect on you your parents gave their lives to keep you alive harry a poor way to repay them gambling their sacrifice for a bag of magic trickshe walked away leaving harry feeling worse by far than he had at any point in snapes office slowly he and ron mounted the marble staircase as harry passed the one eyed witch he remembered the invisibility cloak it was still down there but he didnt dare go and get itits my fault said ron abruptly i persuaded you to go lupins right it was stupid we shouldntve done it he broke off they reached the corridor where the security trolls were pacing and hermione was walking toward them one look at her face convinced harry that she had heard what had happened his heart plummeted had she told professor mcgonagallcome to have a good gloat said ron savagely as she stopped in front of them or have you just been to tell on usno said hermione she was holding a letter in her hands and her lip was trembling i just thought you ought to know hagrid lost his case buckbeak is going to be executedchapter fifteen the quidditch finalhe sent me this hermione said holding out the letterharry took it the parchment was damp and enormous teardrops had smudged the ink so badly in places that it was very difficult to readdear hermione we lost im allowed to bring him back to hogwartsexecution date to be fixed beaky has enjoyed london i wont forget all the help you gave ushagrid they cant do this said harry they cant buckbeak isnt dangerousmalfoys dads frightened the committee into it said hermione wiping her eyes you know what hes like theyre a bunch of doddery old fools and they were scared therell be an appeal though there always is only i cant see any hope nothing will have changedyeah it will said ron fiercely you wont have to do all the work alone this time hermione ill helpoh ronhermione flung her arms around rons neck and broke down completelyron looking quite terrified patted her very awkwardly on the top of the head finally hermione drew awayron im really really sorry about scabbers she sobbedoh well he was old said ron looking thoroughly relieved that she had let go of him and he was a bit useless you never know mum and dad might get me an owl nowthe safety measures imposed on the students since blacks second break in made it impossible for harry ron and hermione to go and visit hagrid in the evenings their only chance of talking to him was during care of magical creatures lessonshe seemed numb with shock at the verdictsall my fault got all tongue tied they was all sittin there in black robes an i kep droppin me notes and forgettin all them dates yeh looked up fer me hermione an then lucius malfoy stood up an said his bit and the committee jus did exacly what he told emtheres still the appeal said ron fiercely dont give up yet were working on itthey were walking back up to the castle with the rest of the classahead they could see malfoy who was walking with crabbe and goyle and kept looking back laughing derisivelysno good ron said hagrid sadly as they reached the castle stepsthat committees in lucius malfoys pocket im jus gonna make sure the rest o beakys time is the happiest hes ever had i owe him thathagrid turned around and hurried back toward his cabin his face buried in his handkerchieflook at him blubbermalfoy crabbe and goyle had been standing just inside the castle doors listeninghave you ever seen anything quite as pathetic said malfoy and hes supposed to be our teacherharry and ron both made furious moves toward malfoy but hermione got there first smackshe had slapped malfoy across the face with all the strength she could muster malfoy staggered harry ron crabbe and goyle stood flabbergasted as hermione raised her hand againdont you dare call hagrid pathetic you foul you evil hermione said ron weakly and he tried to grab her hand as she swungit backget off ronhermione pulled out her wand malfoy stepped backward crabbe and goyle looked at him for instructions thoroughly bewilderedcmon malfoy muttered and in a moment all three of them had disappeared into the passageway to the dungeonshermione ron said again sounding both stunned and irnpressedharry youd better beat him in the quidditch final hermione said shrilly you just better had because i cant stand it if slytherin winswere due in charms said ron still goggling at hermione wed better gothey hurried up the marble staircase toward professor flitwicks classroomyoure late boys said professor flitwick reprovingly as harry opened the classroom door come along quickly wands out were experimenting with cheering charms today weve already divided into pairs harry and ron hurried to a desk at the back and opened their bags ron looked behind himwheres hermione goneharry looked around too hermione hadnt entered the classroom yet harry knew she had been right next to him when he had opened the doorthats weird said harry staring at ron maybe maybe she went to the bathroom or somethingbut hermione didnt turn up all lessonshe couldve done with a cheering charm on her too said ron as theclass left for lunch all grinning broadly the cheering charms had left them with a feeling of great contentmenthermione wasnt at lunch either by the time they had finished their apple pie the after effects of the cheering charms were wearing offand harry and ron had started to get slightly worriedyou dont think malfoy did something to her ron said anxiously as they hurried upstairs toward gryffindor towerthey passed the security trolls gave the fat lady the password flibbertigibbet and scrambled through the portrait hole into the common roomhermione was sitting at a table fast asleep her head resting on an open arithmancy book they went to sit down on either side of her harry prodded her awakewh what said hermione waking with a start and staring wildly around is it time to go w which lesson have we got nowdivination but its not for another twenty minutes said harryhermione why didnt you come to charmswhat oh no hermione squeaked i forgot to go to charmsbut how could you forget said harry you were with us till we were right outside the classroomi dont believe it hermione wailed was professor flitwick angryoh it was malfoy i was thinking about him and i lost track of thingsyou know what hermione said ron looking down at the enormous arithmancy book hermione had been using as a pillow i reckon youre cracking up youre trying to do too muchno im not said hermione brushing her hair out of her eyes and staring hopelessly around for her bag i just made a mistake thats all id better go and see professor flitwick and say sorry ill see you in divinationhermione joined them at the foot of the ladder to professor trelawneys classroom twenty minutes later looking extremely harrassedi cant believe i missed cheering charms and i bet they come up in our exams professor flitwick hinted they mighttogether they climbed the ladder into the dim stifling tower roomglowing on every little table was a crystal ball full of pearly white mist harry ron and hermione sat down together at the same rickety tablei thought we werent starting crystal balls until next term ron muttered casting a wary eye around for professor trelawney in case she was lurking nearbydont complain this means weve finished palmistry harry muttered back i was getting sick of her flinching every time she looked at my handsgood day to you said the familiar misty voice and professor trelawney made her usual dramatic entrance out of the shadows parvati and lavender quivered with excitement their faces lit by the milky glow of their crystal balli have decided to introduce the crystal ball a little earlier than i had planned said professor trelawney sitting with her back to the fire and gazing around the fates have informed me that your examination in june will concern the orb and i am anxious to give you sufficient practicehermione snortedwell honestly the fates have informed her who sets the exam she does what an amazing prediction she said not troubling to keep her voice low harry and ron choked back laughsit was hard to tell whether professor trelawney had heard them as her face was hidden in shadow she continued however as though she had notcrystal gazing is a particularly refined art she said dreamily i do not expect any of you to see when first you peer into the orbs infinite depths we shall start by practicing relaxing the conscious mind and external eyes ron began to snigger uncontrollably and had to stuff his fist in his mouth to stifle the noise so as to clear the inner eye and the superconscious perhaps if we are lucky some of you will see before the end of the classand so they began harry at least felt extremely foolish staring blankly at the crystal ball trying to keep his mind empty when thoughts such as this is stupid kept drifting across it it didnt help that ron kept breaking into silent giggles and hermione kept tuttingseen anything yet harry asked them after a quarter of an hours quiet crystal gazingyeah theres a burn on this table said ron pointing someones spilled their candlethis is such a waste of time hermione hissed i could be practicing something useful i could be catching up on cheering charms professor trelawney rustled pastwould anyone like me to help them interpret the shadowy portents within their orb she murmured over the clinking of her banglesi dont need help ron whispered its obvious what this meanstheres going to be loads of fog tonightboth harry and hermione burst out laughingnow really said professor trelawney as everyones heads turned in their direction parvati and lavender were looking scandalized you are disturbing the clairvoyant vibrations she approached their table and peered into their crystal ball harry felt his heart sinking he was sure he knew what was coming there is something here professor trelawney whispered lowerng herface to the ball so that it was reflected twice in her huge glassessomething moving but what is itharry was prepared to bet everything he owned including his fireboltthat it wasnt good news whatever it was and sure enough my dear professor trelawney breathed gazing up at harry it is hereplainer than ever before my dear stalking toward you growing ever closer the gr oh for goodness sake said hermione loudly not that ridiculous grim againprofessor trelawney raised her enormous eyes to hermiones face parvati whispered something to lavender and they both glared at hermione tooprofessor trelawney stood up surveying hermione with unmistakable angeri am sorry to say that from the moment you have arrived in this class my dear it has been apparent that you do not have what the noble art of divination requires indeed i dont remember ever meeting a student whose mind was so hopelessly mundanethere was a moments silence then fine said hermione suddenly getting up and cramming unfogging the future back into her bag fine she repeated swinging the bag over her shoulder and almost knocking ron off his chair i give up im leavingand to the whole classs amazement hermione strode over to the trapdoor kicked it open and climbed down the ladder out of sightit took a few minutes for the class to settle down again professor trelawney seemed to have forgotten all about the grim she turned abruptly from harry and rons table breathing rather heavily as she tugged her gauzy shawl more closely to herooooo said lavender suddenly making everyone start oooooprofessor trelawney ive just remembered you saw her leaving didntyou didnt you professor around easter one of our number will leave us forever you said it ages ago professorprofessor trelawney gave her a dewy smileyes my dear i did indeed know that miss granger would be leaving usone hopes however that one might have mistaken the signs the inner eye can be a burden you knowlavender and parvati looked deeply impressed and moved over so that professor trelawney could join their table insteadsome day hermiones having eh ron muttered to harry looking awedyeahharry glanced into the crystal ball but saw nothing but swirling white mist had professor trelawney really seen the grim again would he the last thing he needed was another near fatal accident with the quidditch final drawing ever nearerthe easter holidays were not exactly relaxing the third years had never had so much homework neville longbottom seemed close to a nervous collapse and he wasnt the only onecall this a holiday seamus finnigan roared at the common room one afternoon the exams are ages away whatre they playing atbut nobody had as much to do as hermione even without divination she was taking more subjects than anybody else she was usually last to leave the common room at night first to arrive at the library the next morning she had shadows like lupins under her eyes and seemed constantly close to tearsron had taken over responsibility for buckbeaks appeal when he wasnt doing his own work he was poring over enormously thick volumes with names like the handbook of hippogriff psychology and fowl or foul a study of hippogriff brutality he was so absorbed he even forgot to be horrible to crookshanksharry meanwhile had to fit in his homework around quidditch practice every day not to mention endless discussions of tactics with wood the gryffindor slytherin match would take place on the first saturday after the easter holidays slytherin was leading the tournament by exactly two hundred points this meant as wood constantly reminded his team that they needed to win the match by more than that amount to win the cup it also meant that the burden of winning fell largely on harry because capturing the snitch was worth one hundred and fifty pointsso you must catch it only if were more than fifty points up wood told harry constantly only if were more than fifty points up harryor we win the match but lose the cup youve got that havent you you must catch the snitch only if were i know oliver harry yelledthe whole of gryffindor house was obsessed with the coming matchgryffindor hadnt won the quidditch cup since the legendary charlie weasley rons second oldest brother had been seeker but harry doubted whether any of them even wood wanted to win as much as he did the enmity between harry and malfoy was at its highest point ever malfoy was still smarting bout the mud throwing incident in hogsmeade and was even more furious that harry had somehow wormed his way out of punishment harry hadnt forgotten malfoys attempt to sabotage him in the match against ravenclaw but it was the matter of buckbeak that made him most determined to beat malfoy in front of the entire schoolnever in anyones memory had a match approached in such a highly charged atmosphere by the time the holidays were over tension between the two teams and their houses was at the breaking point a number of small scuffles broke out in the corridors culminating in a nasty incident in which a gryffindor fourth year and a slytherin sixth year ended up in the hospital wing with leeks sprouting out of their earsharry was having a particularly bad time of it he couldnt walk to class without slytherins sticking out their legs and trying to trip him up crabbe and goyle kept popping up wherever he went and slouching away looking disappointed when they saw him surrounded by people wood had given instructions that harry should be accompanied everywhere he went in case the slytherins tried to put him out of action the wholeof gryffindor house took up the challenge enthusiastically so that it was impossible for harry to get to classes on time because he was surrounded by a vast chattering crowd harry was more concerned for his firebolts safety than his own when he wasnt flying it he locked it securely in his trunk and frequently dashed back up to gryffindor tower at break times to check that it was still thereall usual pursuits were abandoned in the gryffindor common room the night before the match even hermione had put down her booksi cant work i cant concentrate she said nervouslythere was a great deal of noise fred and george weasley were dealing with the pressure by being louder and more exuberant than ever oliver wood was crouched over a model of a quidditch field in the cornerprodding little figures across it with his wand and muttering to himself angelina alicia and katie were laughing at freds and georges jokesharry was sitting with ron and hermione removed from the center of things trying not to think about the next day because every time he did he had the horrible sensation that something very large was fighting to get out of his stomachyoure going to be fine hermione told him though she looked positively terrifiedyouve got a firebolt said ronyeah said harry his stomach writhingit came as a relief when wood suddenly stood up and yelled team bedharry slept badly first he dreamed that he had overslept and that wood was yelling where were you we had to use neville instead then he dreamed that malfoy and the rest of the slytherin team arrived for the match riding dragons he was flying at breakneck speed trying to avoid a spurt of flames from malfoys steeds mouth when he realized he had forgotten his firebolt he fell through the air and woke with a startit was a few seconds before harry remembered that the match hadnt taken place yet that he was safe in bed and that the slytherin teamdefinitely wouldnt be allowed to play on dragons he was feeling very thirsty quietly as he could he got out of his four poster and went to pour himself some water from the silver jug beneath the windowthe grounds were still and quiet no breath of wind disturbed the treetops in the forbidden forest the whomping willow was motionless and innocent looking it looked as though the conditions for the match would be perfectharry set down his goblet and was about to turn back to his bed when something caught his eye an animal of some kind was prowling across the silvery lawnharry dashed to his bedside table snatched up his glasses and put them on then hurried back to the window it couldnt be the grim not now not right before the match he peered out at the grounds again and after a minutes frantic searching spotted it it was skirting the edge of the forest now it wasnt the grim at all it was a cat harry clutched the window ledge in relief as he recognized the bottlebrush tail it was only crookshanksor was it only crookshanks harry squinted pressing his nose flat against the glass crookshanks seemed to have come to a halt harry was sure he could see something else moving in the shadow of the trees tooand just then it emerged a gigantic shaggy black dog moving stealthily across the lawn crookshanks trotting at its side harry stared what did this mean if crookshanks could see the dog as wellhow could it be an omen of harrys deathron harry hissed ron wake uphuhi need you to tell me if you can see somethingsall dark harry ron muttered thickly whatre you or aboutdown here harry looked quickly back out of the windowcrookshanks and the dog had vanished harry climbed onto the windowsill to look right down into the shadows of the castle but they werent there where had they gonea loud snore told him ron had fallen asleep againharry and the rest of the gryffindor team entered the great hall the next day to enormous applause harry couldnt help grinning broadly as he saw that both the ravenclaw and hufflepuff tables were applauding them too the slytherin table hissed loudly as they passed harry noticed that malfoy looked even paler than usualwood spent the whole of breakfast urging his team to eat while touching nothing himself then he hurried them off to the field before anyone else had finished so they could get an idea of the conditions as they left the great hall everyone applauded againgood luck harry called cho harry felt himself blushingokay no wind to speak of suns a bit bright that could impair your vision watch out for it grounds fairly hard good thatll give us a fast kickoff wood paced the field staring around with the team behind him finallythey saw the front doors of the castle open in the distance and the rest of the school spilling onto the lawnlocker rooms said wood terselynone of them spoke as they changed into their scarlet robes harry wondered if they were feeling like he was as though hed eaten something extremely wriggly for breakfast in what seemed like no time at all wood was saying okay its time lets go they walked out onto the field to a tidal wave of noise threequarters of the crowd was wearing scarlet rosettes waving scarlet flags with thegryffindor lion upon them or brandishing banners with slogans like go gryffindor and lions for the cuk behind the slytherin goal postshowever two hundred people were wearing green the silver serpent of slytherin glittered on their flags and professor snape sat in the very front row wearing green like everyone else and a very grim smileand here are the gryffindors yelled lee jordan who was acting as commentator as usual potter bell johnson spinnet weasley weasleyand wood widely acknowledged as the best team hogwarts has seen in a good few years lees comments were drowned by a tide of boos from the slytherin endand here come the slytherin team led by captain flint hes made some changes in the lineup and seems to be going for size rather than skill more boos from the slytherin crowd harry however thought lee had a point malfoy was easily the smallest person on the slytherin team the rest of them were enormouscaptains shake hands said madam hoochflint and wood approached each other and grasped each others hand very tightly it looked as though each was trying to break the others fingersmount your brooms said madam hooch three two onethe sound of her whistle was lost in the roar from the crowd as fourteen brooms rose into the air harry felt his hair fly back off his forehead his nerves left him in the thrill of the flight he glanced around saw malfoy on his tail and sped off in search of the snitchand its gryffindor in possession alicia spinner of gryffindor with the quaffle heading straight for the slytherin goal posts looking good alicia argh no quaffle intercepted by warrington warrington of slytherin tearing up the field wham nice bludger work there by george weasley warrington drops the quaffle its caught by johnsongryffindor back in possession come on angelina nice swerve

ouchangelina was nearly thrown from her broom as marcus flint went smashing into hersorry said flint as the crowd below booed sorry didnt see hera moment later fred weasley chucked his beaters club at the back of flints head flints nose smashed into the handle of his broom and began to bleedthat will do shrieked madam hooch zooming between then penalty shot to gryffindor for an unprovoked attack on their chaser penalty shot to slytherin for deliberate damage to their chasercome off it miss howled fred but madam hooch blew her whistle and alicia flew forward to take the penaltycome on alicia yelled lee into the silence that had descended on the crowd yes shes beaten the keeper twenty zero to gryffindorharry turned the firebolt sharply to watch flint still bleeding freelyfly forward to take the slytherin penalty wood was hovering in front of the gryffindor goal posts his jaw clenchedcourse woods a superb keeper lee jordan told the crowd as flint waited for madam hoochs whistle superb very difficult to pass very difficult indeed yes i dont believe it hes saved itrelieved harry zoomed away gazing around for the snitch but still making sure he caught every word of lees commentary it was essential that he hold malfoy off the snitch until gryffindor was more than fifty points up gryffindor in possession no slytherin in possession nogryffindor back in possession and its katie bell katie bell for gryffindor with the quaffle shes streaking up the field that was deliberatemontague a slytherin chaser had swerved in front of katie and instead of seizing the quaffle had grabbed her head katie cart wheeled in the air managed to stay on her broom but dropped the quafflemadam hoochs whistle rang out again as she soared over to montague and began shouting at him a minute later katie had put another penalty past the slytherin seekerthirty zero take that you dirty cheating jordan if you cant commentate in an unbiased way im telling it like it is professorharry felt a huge jolt of excitement he had seen the snitch it was shimmering at the foot of one of the gryffindor goal posts but he mustnt catch it yet and if malfoy saw it faking a look of sudden concentration harry pulled his firebolt around and sped off toward the slytherin end it worked malfoy went haring after him clearly thinking harry had seen the snitch therewhooshone of the bludgers came streaking past harrys right ear hit by the gigantic slytherin beater derrick then again whooshthe second bludger grazed harrys elbow the other beater bole was closing inharry had a fleeting glimpse of bole and derrick zooming toward himclubs raised he turned the firebolt upward at the last second and bole and derrick collided with a sickening crunchha haaa yelled lee jordan as the slytherin beaters lurched away from each other clutching their heads too bad boys youll need to get up earlier than that to beat a firebold and its gryffindor in possession again as johnson takes the quaffle flint alongside her poke him in the eye angelina it was a joke professor it was a joke oh no flint in possession flint flying toward the gryffindor goal posts come on now wood save but flint had scored there was an eruption of cheers from the slytherin end and lee swore so badly that professor mcgonagall tried to tug the magical megaphone away from himsorry professor sorry woia happen again so gryffindor in the leadthirty points to ten and gryffindor in possession it was turning into the dirtiest game harry had ever played in enraged that gryffindor had taken such an early lead the slytherins were rapidly resorting to any means to take the quaffle bole hit alicia with his club and tried to say hed thought she was a bludger george weasley elbowed bole in the face in retaliation madam hooch awarded both teams penalties and wood pulled off another spectacular save making the score forty ten to gryffindorthe snitch had disappeared again malfoy was still keeping close to harry as he soared over the match looking around for it once gryffindor was fifty points ahead katie scored fifty ten fred and george weasley were swooping around her clubs raised in case any of the slytherins were thinking of revenge bole and derrick took advantage of freds and georges absence to aim both bludgers at wood they caught him in the stomach one after the other and he rolled over in the air clutching his broomcompletely windedmadam hooch was beside herselfyou do not attack the keeper unless the quaffle is within the scoring area she shrieked at bole and derrick gryffindor penaltyand angelina scored sixty ten moments later fred weasley pelted a bludger at warrington knocking the quaffle out of his hands alicia seized it and put it through the slytherin goal seventy tenthe gryffindor crowd below was screaming itself hoarse gryffindor was sixty points in the lead and if harry caught the snitch now the cup was theirs harry could almost feel hundreds of eyes following him as he soared around the field high above the rest of the game with malfoy speeding along behind himand then he saw it the snitch was sparkling twenty feet above himharry put on a huge burst of speed the wind was roaring in his ears he stretched out his hand but suddenly the firebolt was slowing down horrified he looked around malfoy had thrown himself forward grabbed hold of the firebolts tail and was pulling it backyou harry was angry enough to hit malfoy but couldnt reach malfoy was panting with the effort of holding onto the firebolt but his eyes were sparkling maliciously he had achieved what hed wanted to do the snitch had disappeared againpenalty penalty to gryffindor ive never seen such tactics madam hooch screeched shooting up to where malfoy was sliding back onto his nimbus two thousand and oneyou cheating scum lee jordan was howling into the megaphonedancing out of professor mcgonagalls reach you filthy cheating b pprofessor mcgonagall didnt even bother to tell him off she was actually shaking her finger in malfoys direction her hat had fallenoff and she too was shouting furiouslyalicia took gryffindors penalty but she was so angry she missed by several feet the gryffindor team was losing concentration and the slytherins delighted by malfoys foul on harry were being spurred on to greater heightsslytherin in possession slytherin heading for goal montague scores lee groaned seventy twenty to gryffindorharry was now marking malfoy so closely their knees kept hitting each other harry wasnt going to let malfoy anywhere near the snitchget out of it potter malfoy yelled in frustration as he tried to turn and found harry blocking himangelina johnson gets the quaffle for gryffindor come on angelinacome onharry looked around every single slytherin player apart from malfoy was streaking up the pitch toward angelina including the slytherin keeper they were all going to block her harry wheeled the firebolt around bent so low he was lying flat along the handle and kicked it forward like a bullet he shot toward the slytherinsaaaaaaarrrghthey scattered as the firebolt zoomed toward them angelinas way was clearshe scores she scores gryffindor leads by eighty points to twentyharry who had almost pelted headlong into the stands skidded to a halt in midair reversed and zoomed back into the middle of the fieldand then he saw something to make his heart stand still malfoy was diving a look of triumph on his face there a few feet above the grass below was a tiny golden glimmer harry urged the firebolt downward but malfoy was miles ahead go go go harry urged his broom he was gaining on malfay harry flattened himself to the broom handle as bole sent a bludger at him he was at malfoys ankles he was level harry threw himself forward took both hands off his broom he knocked malfoys arm out of the way and yeshe pulled out of his dive his hand in the air and the stadium exploded harry soared above the crowd an odd ringing in his ears the tiny golden ball was held tight in his fist beating its wings hopelessly against his fingersthen wood was speeding toward him half blinded by tears he seized harry around the neck and sobbed unrestrainedly into his shoulder harry felt two large thumps as fred and george hit them then angelinasalicias and katies voices weve won the cup weve won the cuptangled together in a many armed hug the gryffindor team sank yelling hoarsely back to earthwave upon wave of crimson supporters was pouring over the barriers onto the field hands were raining down on their backs harry had a confused impression of noise and bodies pressing in on him then he and the rest of the team were hoisted onto the shoulders of the crowd thrust into the light he saw hagrid plastered with crimson rosettes yeh beat em harry yeh beat emwait till i tell buckbeak there was percy jumping up and down like a maniac all dignity forgotten professor mcgonagall was sobbing harder even than wood wiping her eyes with an enormous gryffindor flag and there fighting their way toward harry were ron and hermione words failed them they simply beamed as harry was borne toward the standswhere dumbledore stood waiting with the enormous quidditch cupif only there had been a dementor around as a sobbing wood passed harry the cup as he lifted it into the air harry felt he could haveproduced the worlds best patronuschapter sixteen professor trelawneys predictionharrys euphoria at finally winning the quidditch cup lasted at least a week even the weather seemed to be celebrating as june approached the days became cloudless and sultry and all anybody felt like doing was strolling onto the grounds and flopping down on the grass with several pints of iced pumpkin juice perhaps playing a casual game of gobstones or watching the giant squid propel itself dreamily across the surface of the lakebut they couldnt exams were nearly upon them and instead of lazing around outside the students were forced to remain inside the castletrying to bully their brains into concentrating while enticing wafts of summer air drifted in through the windows even fred and george weasley had been spotted working they were about to take their owls ordinary wizarding levels percy was getting ready to take his newts nastily exhausting wizarding tests the highest qualification hogwarts offered as percy hoped to enter the ministry of magic he needed top grades he was becoming increasingly edgy and gave very severe punishments to anybody who disturbed the quiet of the common room in the evenings in fact the only person who seemed more anxious than percy was hermioneharry and ron had given up asking her how she was managing to attend several classes at once but they couldnt restrain themselves when they saw the exam schedule she had drawn up for herself the first column readmonday oclock arithmancy oclock transfiguration lunchoclock charms oclock ancient runes hermione ron said cautiously because she was liable to explode when interrupted these days er are you sure youve copied down these times rightwhat snapped hermione picking up the exam schedule and examining ityes of course i haveis there any point asking how youre going to sit for two exams at once said harryno said hermione shortly have either of you seen my copy of numerology and gramaticaoh yeah i borrowed it for a bit of bedtime reading said ron but very quietly hermione started shifting heaps of parchment harry ronand hermione plenty of opportunity to speak to hagridbeakys gettin a bit depressed hagrid told them bending low on the pretense of checking that harrys flobberworm was still alive bin cooped up too long but still well know day after tomorrow one way or the other they had potions that afternoon which was an unqualified disaster try as harry might he couldnt get his confusing concoction to thicken and snape standing watch with an air of vindictive pleasure scribbled something that looked suspiciously like a zero onto his notes before moving awaythen came astronomy at midnight up on the tallest tower history of magic on wednesday morning in which harry scribbled everything florean fortescue had ever told him about medieval witch hunts while wishing he could have had one of fortescues choco nut sundaes with him in the stifling classroom wednesday afternoon meant herbology in the greenhouses under a baking hot sun then back to the common room once more with sunburnt necks thinking longingly of this time next daywhen it would all be overtheir second to last exam on thursday morning was defense against the dark arts professor lupin had compiled the most unusual exam any of them had ever taken a sort of obstacle course outside in the sun where they had to wade across a deep paddling pool containing a grindylowcross a series of potholes full of red caps squish their way across a patch of marsh while ignoring misleading directions from a hinkypunkthen climb into an old trunk and battle with a new boggartexcellent harry lupin muttered as harry climbed out of the trunkgrinning full marksflushed with his success harry hung around to watch ron and hermioneron did very well until he reached the hinkypunk which successfully confused him into sinking waist high into the quagmire hermione did everything perfectly until she reached the trunk with the boggart in itafter about a minute inside it she burst out again screaminghermione said lupin startled whats the matterp p professor mcgonagall hermione gasped pointing into the trunk sh she said id failed everythingit took a little while to calm hermione down when at last she had regained a grip on herself she harry and ron went back to the castleron was still slightly inclined to laugh at hermiones boggart but an argument was averted by the sight that met them on the top of the stepscornelius fudge sweating slightly in his pinstriped cloak was standing there staring out at the grounds he started at the sight of harryhello there harry he said just had an exam i expect nearly finishedyes said harry hermione and ron not being on speaking terms with the minister of magic hovered awkwardly in the backgroundlovely day said fudge casting an eye over the lakepity pityhe sighed deeply and looked down at harryim here on an unpleasant mission harry the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures required a witness to the execution of a mad hippogriff as i needed to visit hogwarts to check on the black situation i was asked to step indoes that mean the appeals already happened ron interruptedstepping forwardno no its scheduled for this afternoon said fudge looking curiously at ronthen you might not have to witness an execution at a said eon stoutly the hippogriff might get offbefore fudge could answer two wizards came through the castle doors behind him one was so ancient he appeared to be withering before their very eyes the other was tall and strapping with a thin back mustacheharry gathered that they were representatives of the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures because tie very old wizard squinted toward hagrids cabin and said in a feeble voice dear dear im getting too old for this two oclock isnt it fudgethe black mustached man was fingering something in his belt harry looked and saw that he was running one broad thumb along the blade of a shining axe ron opened his mouth to say something but hermione nudged him hard in the ribs and jerked her head toward the entrance hallwhyd you stop me said ron angrily as they entered the great hall for lunch did you see them theyve even got the axe ready this isnt justiceron your dad works for the ministry you cant go saying things like that to his boss said hermione but she too looked very upset as long as hagrid keeps his head this time and argue hi case properlythey cant possibly execute buckbeakbut harry could tell hermione didnt really believe what she was sayingall around them people were talking excitedly as they ate their lunchhappily anticipating the end of the exams that afternoon but harryron and hermione lost in worry about hagrid and buckbeak didnt join inharrys and rons last exam was divination hermiones muggle studiesthey walked up the marble staircase together hermione left them on the first floor and harry and ron proceeded all the way up to the seventhwhere many of their class were sitting on the spiral staircase to professor trelawneys classroom trying to cram in a bit of last minute studyingshes seeing us all separately neville informed them as they went to sit down next to him he had his copy of unfogging the future open on his lap at the pages devoted to crystal gazing have either of you ever seen anything in a crystal ball he asked them unhappilynope said ron in an offhand voice he kept checking his watch harryknew that he was counting down the time until buckbeaks appeal startedthe line of people outside the classroom shortened very slowly as each person climbed back down the silver ladder the rest of the class hissed what did she ask was it okaybut they all refused to sayshe says the crystal balls told her that if i tell you ill have a horrible accident squeaked neville as he clambered back down the ladder toward harry and ron who had now reached the landingthats convenient snorted ron you know im starting to think hermione was right about her he jabbed his thumb toward the trapdoor overhead shes a right old fraudyeah said harry looking at his own watch it was now two oclockwish shed hurry upparvati came back down the ladder glowing with prideshe says ive got all the makings of a true seer she informed harryand ron i saw loads of stuff well good luckshe hurried off down the spiral staircase toward lavenderronald weasley said the familiar misty voice from over their headsron grimaced at harry and climbed the silver ladder out of sight harry was now the only person left to be tested he settled himself on the floor with his back against the wall listening to a fly buzzing in the sunny window his mind across the grounds with hagridfinally after about twenty minutes rons large feet reappeared on the ladderhowd it go harry asked him standing uprubbish said ron couldnt see a thing so i made some stuff updont think she was convinced thoughmeet you in the common room harry muttered as professor trelawneys voice called harry potterthe tower room was hotter than ever before the curtains were closedthe fire was alight and the usual sickly scent made harry cough as he stumbled through the clutter of chairs and table to where professor trelawney sat waiting for him before a large crystal ballgood day my dear she said softly if you would kindly gaze into the orb take your time now then tell me what you see within itharry bent over the crystal ball and stared stared as hard as he couldwilling it to show him something other than swirling white fog but nothing happenedwell professor trelawney prompted delicately what do you seethe heat was overpowering and his nostrils were stinging with the perfumed smoke wafting from the fire beside them he thought of what ron had just said and decided to pretender said harry a dark shape umwhat does it resemble whispered professor trelawney think nowharry cast his mind around and it landed on buckbeaka hippogriff he said firmlyindeed whispered professor trelawney scribbling keenly on the parchment perched upon her knees my boy you may well be seeing the outcome of poor hagrids trouble with the ministry of magic look closer does the hippogriff appear to have its headyes said harry firmlyare you sure professor trelawney urged him are you quite suredear you dont see it writhing on the ground perhaps and a shadowy figure raising an axe behind itno said harry starting to feel slightly sickno blood no weeping hagridno said harry again wanting more than ever to leave the room and the heat it looks fine its flying awayprofessor trelawney sighedwell dear i think well leave it there a little disappointingbut im sure you did your bestrelieved harry got up picked up his bag and turned to go but then a loud harsh voice spoke behind himit will happen tonightharry wheeled around professor trelawney had gone rigid in her armchair her eyes were unfocused and her mouth saggings sorry said harrybut professor trelawney didnt seem to hear him her eyes started to roll harry sat there in a panic she looked as though she was about to have some sort of seizure he hesitated thinking of running to the hospital wing and then professor trelawney spoke again in the same harsh voice quite unlike her ownthe dark lord lies alone and friendless abandoned by his followershis servant has been chained these twelve years tonightbefore midnight the servant will break free and set out to rejoin his master the dark lord will rise again with his servants aid greater and more terrible than ever he was tonight before midnight the servant will set ou to rejoin his masterprofessor trelawneys head fell forward onto her chest she made a grunting sort of noise harry sat there staring at her then quite suddenly professor trelawneys head snapped up againim so sorry dear boy she said dreamily the heat of the day you know i drifted off for a momentharry sat there staring at heris there anything wrong my dearyou you just told me that the the dark lords going to rise again that his servants going to go back to himprofessor trelawney looked thoroughly startledthe dark lord he who must not be named my dear boy thats hardly something to joke about rise again indeed but you just said it you said the dark lord i think you must have dozed off too dear said professor trelawneyi would certainly not presume to predict anything quite as far fetched as thatharry climbed back down the ladder and the spiral staircasewondering had he just heard professor trelawney make a real prediction or had that been her idea of an impressive end to the testfive minutes later he was dashing past the security trolls outside the entrance to gryffindor tower professor trelawneys words still resounding in his head people were striding past him in the opposite direction laughing and joking heading for the grounds and a bit of long awaited freedom by the time he had reached the portrait hole and entered the common room it was almost deserted over in the cornerhowever sat ron and hermioneprofessor trelawney harry panted just told me but he stopped abruptly at the sight of their facesbuckbeak lost said ron weakly hagrids just sent thishagrids note was dry this time no tears had splattered it yet his hand seemed to have shaken so much as he wrote that it was hardly legiblelost appeal theyre going to execute at sunset nothing you can dodont come down i dont want you to see ithagrid weve got to go said harry at once he cant just sit there on his own waiting for the executionersunset though said ron who was staring out the window ill a glazed sort of way wed never be allowed specially you harryharry sank his head into his hands thinkingif we only had the invisibility cloakwhere is it said hermioneharry told her about leaving it in the passageway under the one eyed witchif snape sees me anywhere near there again im in serious trouble he finishedthats true said hermione getting to her feet if he sees youhow do you open the witchs hump againyou you tap it and say dissendium said harry but hermione didnt wait for the rest of his sentence she strode across the room pushed open the fat ladys portrait and vanished from sightshe hasnt gone to get it ron said staring after hershe had hermione returned a quarter of an hour later with the silvery cloak folded carefully under her robeshermione i dont know whats gotten into you lately said ronastounded first you hit malfoy then you walk out on professor trelawney hermione looked rather flatteredthey went down to dinner with everybody else but did not return to gryffindor tower afterward harry had the cloak hidden down tie front of his robes he had to keep his arms folded to hide the lump they skulked in an empty chamber off the entrance hall listening until they were sure it was deserted they heard a last pair of people hurrying across the hall and a door slamming hermione poked her head around the doorokay she whispered no one there cloak on walking very close together so that nobody would see them they crossed the hall on tiptoe beneath the cloak then walked down the stone front steps into the grounds the sun was already sinking behind the forbidden forest gilding the top branches of the treesthey reached hagrids cabin and knocked he was a minute in answeringand when he did he looked all around for his visitor pale faced and tremblingits us harry hissed were wearing the invisibility cloak let us in and we can take it offyeh shouldnve come hagrid whispered but he stood back and they stepped inside hagrid shut the door quickly and harry pulled off the cloakhagrid was not crying nor did he throw himself upon their necks he looked like a man who did not know where he was or what to do this helplessness was worse to watch than tearswan some tea he said his great hands were shaking as he reached for the kettlewheres buckbeak hagrid said hermione hesitantlyi i took him outside said hagrid spilling milk all over the table as he filled up the jug hes tethered in me pumpkin patch thought he oughta see the trees an an smell fresh air before hagrids hand trembled so violently that the milk jug slipped from his grasp and shattered all over the floorill do it hagrid said hermione quickly hurrying over and starting to clean up the messtheres another one in the cupboard hagrid said sitting down and wiping his forehead on his sleeve harry glanced at ron who looked back hopelesslyisnt there anything anyone can do hagrid harry asked fiercelysitting down next to him dumbledore hes tried said hagrid hes got no power ter overrule the committee he told em

dumbledore catch yeh out without permission harry yehll be in big troublesilent tears were now streaming down hermiones face but she hid them from hagrid bustling around making tea then as she picked up the milk bottle to pour some into the jug she let out a shriekron i dont believe it its scabbersron gaped at herwhat are you talking abouthermione carried the milk jug over to the table and turned it upside down with a frantic squeak and much scrambling to get back insidescabbers the rat came sliding out onto the tablescabbers said ron blankly scabbers what are you doing herehe grabbed the struggling rat and held him up to the light scabberslooked dreadful he was thinner than ever large tufts of hair had fallen out leaving wide bald patches and he writhed in rons hands as though desperate to free himself its okay scabbers said ron no cats theres nothing here to hurt youhagrid suddenly stood up his eyes fixed on the window his normally ruddy face had gone the color of parchmenttheyre cominharry ron and hermione whipped around a group of men was walking down the distant castle steps in front was albus dumbledore his silver beard gleaming in the dying sun next to him trotted cornelius fudgebehind them came the feeble old committee member and the executionermacnairyeh gotta go said hagrid every inch of him was trembling they mustn find yeh here go nowron stuffed scabbers into his pocket and hermione picked up the cloakill let yeh out the back way said hagridthey followed him to the door into his back garden harry felt strangely unreal and even more so when he saw buckbeak a few yards away tethered to a tree behind hagrids pumpkin patch buckbeak seemed to know something was happening he turned his sharp head from side to side and pawed the ground nervouslyits okay beaky said hagrid softly its okay he turned to harry ron and hermione go on he said get goinbut they didnt movehagrid we cant well tell them what really happened they cant kill him go said hagrid fiercely its bad enough without you lot in trouble an allthey had no choice as hermione threw the cloak over harry and ron they heard voices at the front of the cabin hagrid looked at the place where they had just vanished from sightgo quick he said hoarsely don listenand he strode back into his cabin as someone knocked at the front doorslowly in a kind of horrified trance harry ron and hermione set off silently around hagrids house as they reached the other side the front door closed with a sharp snapplease lets hurry hermione whispered i cant stand it i cant bear itthey started up the sloping lawn toward the castle the sun was sinking fast now the sky had turned to a clear purple tinged grey but to the west there was a ruby red glowron stopped deadoh please ron hermione beganits scabbers he wont stay put ron was bent over trying to keep scabbers in his pocket but the rat was going berserk squeaking madly twisting and flailing trying to sink his teeth into rons handscabbers its me you idiot its ron ron hissedthey heard a door open behind them and mens voicesoh ron please lets move theyre going to do it hermione breathedokay scabbers stay put they walked forward harry like hermione was trying not to listen to the rumble of voices behind them ron stopped againi cant hold him scabbers shut up everyonell hear us the rat was squealing wildly but not loudly enough to cover up the sounds drifting from hagrids garden there was a jumble of indistinct male voices a silence and then without warning the unmistakable swish and thud of an axehermione swayed on the spotthey did it she whispered to harry i d dont believe it they did itchapter seventeen cat rat and dogharrys mind had gone blank with shock the three of them stood transfixed with horror under the invisibility cloak the very last rays of the setting sun were casting a bloody light over the long shadowed grounds then behind them they heard a wild howlinghagrid harry muttered without thinking about what he was doing he made to turn back but both ron and hermione seized his armswe cant said ron who was paper white hell be in worse trouble if they know weve been to see himhermiones breathing was shallow and unevenhow could they she choked how could theycome on said ron whose teeth seemed to be chatteringthey set off back toward the castle walking slowly to keep themselves hidden under the cloak the light was fading fast nowby the time they reached open ground darkness was settling like a spell around themscabbers keep still ron hissed clamping his hand over his chestthe rat was wriggling madly ron came to a sudden halt trying to force scabbers deeper into his pocket whats the matter with you you stupid rat stay still ouch he bit meron be quiet hermione whispered urgently fudgell be out here in a minute he wont stay put scabbers was plainly terrified he was writhing with all his mighttrying to break free of rons gripwhats the matter with himbut harry had just seen stinking toward them his body low to the ground wide yellow eyes glinting eerily in the darkness crookshankswhether he could see them or was following the sound of scabberss squeaks harry couldnt tellcrookshanks hermione moaned no go away crookshanks go awaybut the cat was getting nearer scabbers notoo late the rat had slipped between rons clutching fingers hit the ground and scampered away in one bound crookshanks sprang after himand before harry or hermione could stop him ron had thrown the invisibility cloak off himself and pelted away into the darknessron hermione moanedshe and harry looked at each other then followed at a sprint it as impossible to run full out under the cloak they pulled it off and it streamed behind them like a banner as they hurtled after ron they could hear his feet thundering along ahead and his shouts at crookshanksget away from him get away scabbers come here there was a loud thudgotcha get off you stinking cat harry and hermione almost fell over ron they skidded to a stop right in front of him he was sprawled on the ground but scabbers was back in his pocket he had both hands held tight over the quivering lumpron come on back under the cloak hermione panted dumbledore the minister theyll be coming back out in a minute but before they could cover themselves again before they could even catch their breath they heard the soft pounding of gigantic pawssomething was bounding toward them quiet as a shadow an enormouspale eyed jet black dogharry reached for his wand but too late the dog had made an enormous leap and the front paws hit him on the chest he keeled over backward in a whirl of hair he felt its hot breath saw inch long teeth but the force of its leap had carried it too far it rolled off himdazed feeling as though his ribs were broken harry tried to stand up he could hear it growling as it skidded around for a new attackron was on his feet as the dog sprang back toward them he pushed harry aside the dogs jaws fastened instead around rons outstretched armharry lunged forward he seized a handful of the brutes hair but it was dragging ron away as easily as though he were a rag doll then out of nowhere something hit harry so hard across the face he was knocked off his feet again he heard hermione shriek with pain and fall tooharry groped for his wand blinking blood out of his eyes lumoshe whisperedthe wandlight showed him the trunk of a thick tree they had chased scabbers into the shadow of the whomping willow and its branches were creaking as though in a high wind whipping backward and forward to stop them going nearerand there at the base of the trunk was the dog dragging ron backward into a large gap in the roots ron was fighting furiously but his head and torso were slipping out of sight ron harry shouted trying to follow but a heavy branch whipped lethally through the air and he was forced backward againall they could see now was one of rons legs which he had hooked around a root in an effort to stop the dog from pulling him farther underground but a horrible crack cut the air like a gunshot rons leg had broken and a moment later his foot vanished from sightharry weve got to go for help hermione gasped she was bleeding too the willow had cut her across the shoulderno that things big enough to eat him we havent got time harry were never going to get through without help another branch whipped down at them twigs clenched like knucklesif that dog can get in we can harry panted darting here and theretrying to find a way through the vicious swishing branches but he couldnt get an inch nearer to the tree roots without being in range of the trees blowsoh help help hermione whispered frantically dancing u certainly on the spot pleasecrookshanks darted forward he slithered between the battering branches like a snake and placed his front paws upon a knot on the trunkabruptly as though the tree had been turned to marble it stopped moving not a leaf twitched or shookcrookshanks hermione whispered uncertainly she now grasped harrys arm painfully hard how did he know hes friends with that dog said harry grimly ive seen them together come on and keep your wand out they covered the distance to the trunk in seconds but before they had reached the gap in the roots crookshanks had slid into it with a flick of his bottlebrush tail harry went next he crawled forward headfirstand slid down an earthy slope to the bottom of a very low tunnelcrookshanks was a little way along his eyes flashing in the light from harrys wand seconds later hermione slithered down beside himwheres ron she whispered in a terrified voicethis way said harry setting off bent backed after crookshankswhere does this tunnel come out hermione asked breathlessly from behind himi dont know its marked on the marauders map but fred and george said no ones ever gotten into it it goes off the edge of the mapbut it looked like it was heading for hogsmeadethey moved as fast as they could bent almost double ahead of themcrookshankss tail bobbed in and out of view on and on went the passage it felt at least as long as the one to honeydukes all harry could think of was ron and what the enormous dog might be doing to him he was drawing breath in sharp painful gasps running at a crouchand then the tunnel began to rise moments later it twisted and crookshanks had gone instead harry could see a patch of dim light through a small openinghe and hermione paused gasping for breath edging forward both raised their wands to see what lay beyondit was a room a very disordered dusty room paper was peeling from the walls there were stains all over the floor every piece of furniturewas broken as though somebody had smashed it the windows were all boarded upharry glanced at hermione who looked very frightened but noddedharry pulled himself out of the hole staring around the room was deserted but a door to their right stood open leading to a shadowy hallway hermione suddenly grabbed harrys arm again her wide eyes were traveling around the boarded windowsharry she whispered i think were in the shrieking shackharry looked around his eyes fell on a wooden chair near them large chunks had been torn out of it one of the legs had been ripped off entirelyghosts didnt do that he said slowlyat that moment there was a creak overhead something had moved upstairs both of them looked up at the ceiling hermiones grip on harrys arm was so tight he was losing feeling in his fingers he raised his eyebrows at her she nodded again and let goquietly as they could they crept out into the hall and up the crumbling staircase everything was covered in a thick layer of dust except the floor where a wide shiny stripe had been made by something being dragged upstairsthey reached the dark landingnox they whispered together and the lights at the end of their wands went out only one door was open as they crept toward it they heard movement from behind it a low moan and then a deep loud purring they exchanged a last look a last nodwand held tightly before him harry kicked the door wide openon a magnificent four poster bed with dusty hangings lay crookshankspurring loudly at the sight of them on the floor beside him clutching his leg which stuck out at a strange angle was ronharry and hermione dashed across to himron are you okaywheres the dognot a dog ron moaned his teeth were gritted with pain harry its a trap what hes the dog hes an animagusron was staring over harrys shoulder harry wheeled around with a snap the man in the shadows closed the door behind thema mass of filthy matted hair hung to his elbows if eyes hadnt been shining out of the deep dark sockets he might have been a corpse the waxy skin was stretched so tightly over the bones of his face it looked like a skull his yellow teeth were bared in a grin it was sirius blackexpelliarmushe croaked pointing rons wand at themharrys and hermiones wands shot out of their hands high in the airand black caught them then he took a step closer his eyes were fixed on harryi thought youd come and help your friend he said hoarselyhis voice sounded as though he had long since lost the habit of using it your father would have done the same for me brave of you not to run for a teacher im grateful it will make everything much easierthe taunt about his father rang in harrys ears as though black had bellowed it a boiling hate erupted in harrys chest leaving no place for fear for the first time in his life he wanted his wand back in his hand not to defend himself but to attack to kill without knowingwhat he was doing he started forward but there was a sudden movement on either side of him and two pairs of hands grabbed him and held him back no harry hermione gasped in a petrified whisper ronhowever spoke to blackif you want to kill harry youll have to kill us too he said fiercely though the effort of standing upright was draining him of still more color and he swayed slightly as he spokesomething flickered in blacks shadowed eyeslie down he said quietly to ron you will damage that leg even moredid you hear me ron said weakly though he was clinging painfully to harry to stay upright youll have to kill all three of ustherell be only one murder here tonight said brack and his grin widenedwhys that harry spat trying to wrench himself free of ron and hermione didnt care last time did you didnt mind slaughtering all those muggles to get at pettigrew whats the matter gone soft in azkabanharry hermione whimpered be quiethe killed my mum and dad harry roared and with a huge effort he broke free of hermiones and rons restraint and lunged forward he had forgotten about magic he had forgotten that he was short and skinny and thirteen whereas black was a tall full grown man all harry knew was that he wanted to hurt black as badly as he could and that he didnt care how much he got hurt in return perhaps it was the shock of harry doing something so stupid but black didnt raise the wands in time one of harrys hands fastened over his wasted wrist forcing the wand tips away the knuckles of harrys other hand collided with the side of blacks head and they fell backwardinto the wall hermione was screaming ron was yelling there was a blinding flash as the wands in blacks hand sent a jet of sparks into the air that missed harrys face by inches harry felt the shrunken arm under his fingers twisting madly but he clung on his other hand punching every part of black it could findbut blacks free hand had found harrys throat no he hissed ive waited too long the fingers tightened harry choked his glasses askewthen he saw hermiones foot swing out of nowhere black let go of harry with a grunt of pain ron had thrown himself on blacks wand hand and harry heard a faint clatter he fought free of the tangle of bodies and saw his own wand rolling across the floor he threw himself toward it but arghcrookshanks had joined the fray both sets of front claws had sunk themselves deep into harrys arm harry threw him off but crookshanks now darted toward harrys wand no you dont roared harry and he aimed a kick at crookshanks that made the cat leap aside spitting harry snatched up his wand and turned get out of the way he shouted at ron and hermionethey didnt need telling twice hermione gasping for breath her lip bleeding scrambled aside snatching up her and rons wands ron crawled to the four poster and collapsed onto it panting his white face now tinged with green both hands clutching his broken legblack was sprawled at the bottom of the wall his thin chest rose and fell rapidly as he watched harry walking slowly nearer his wand pointing straight at blacks heartgoing to kill me harry he whisperedharry stopped right above him his wand still pointing at blacks chestlooking down at him a livid bruise was rising around blacks left eye and his nose was bleedingyou killed my parents said harry his voice shaking slightly but his wand hand quite steadyblack stared up at him out of those sunken eyesi dont deny it he said very quietly but if you knew the whole storythe whole story harry repeated a furious pounding in his ears you sold them to voldemort thats all i need to knowyouve got to listen to me black said and there was a note of urgency in his voice now youll regret it if you dont you dont understandi understand a lot better than you think said harry and his voice shook more than ever you never heard her did you my mum trying to stop voldemort killing me and you did that you did itbefore either of them could say another word something ginger streaked past harry crookshanks leapt onto blacks chest and settled himself there right over blacks heart black blinked and looked down at the catget off he murmured trying to push crookshanks off himbut crookshanks sank his claws into blacks robes and wouldnt shift he turned his ugly squashed face to harry and looked up at him with those great yellow eyes to his right hermione gave a dry sobharry stared down at black and crookshanks his grip tightening on the wand so what if he had to kill the cat too it was in league with black if it was prepared to die trying to protect black thatwasnt harrys business if black wanted to save it that only proved he cared more for crookshanks than for harrys parentsharry raised the wand now was the moment to do it now was the moment to avenge his mother and father he was going to kill black he had to kill black this was his chancethe seconds lengthened and still harry stood frozen there wand poisedblack staring up at him crookshanks on his chest rons ragged breathing came from near the bed hermione was quite silentand then came a new sound muffled footsteps were echoing up through the floor someone was moving downstairswere up here hermione screamed suddenly were up here sirius black quickblack made a startled movement that almost dislodged crookshanks harry gripped his wand convulsively do it now said a voice in his head but the footsteps were thundering up the stairs and harry still hadnt done itthe door of the room burst open in a shower of red sparks and harry wheeled around as professor lupin came hurtling into the room his face bloodless his wand raised and ready his eyes flickered over ron lying on the floor over hermione cowering next to the door to harrystanding there with his wand covering black and then to black himselfcrumpled and bleeding at harrys feetexpelliarmus lupin shoutedharrys wand flew once more out of his hand so did the two hermione was holding lupin caught them all deftly then moved into the room staring at black who still had crookshanks lying protectively across his chestharry stood there feeling suddenly empty he hadnt done it his nerve had failed him black was going to be handed back to the dementorsthen lupin spoke in a very tense voicewhere is he siriusharry looked quickly at lupin he didnt understannd what lupin meantwho was lupin talking about he turned to look at black againblacks face was quite expressionless for a few seconds he didnt move at all then very slowly he raised his empty hand and pointed straight at ron mystified harry glanced around at ron who looked bewilderedbut then lupin muttered staring at black so intently it seemed he was trying to read his mind why hasnt he shown himself before now unless lupins eyes suddenly widened as though he was seeing something beyond black something none of the rest could see unless he was the one unless you switched without telling mevery slowly his sunken gaze never leaving lupins face black noddedprofessor harry interrupted loudly whats going on but he never finished the question because what he saw made his voice die in his throat lupin was lowering his wand gazing fixed at blackthe professor walked to blacks side seized his hand pulled him to his feet so that crookshanks fell to the floor and embraced black like a brotherharry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomachdont believe it hermione screamedlupin let go of black and turned to her she had raised herself off the floor and was pointing at lupin wild eyed you you hermione you and himhermione calm down i didnt tell anyone hermione shrieked ive been covering up for you hermione listen to me please lupin shouted i can explain harry could feel himself shaking not with fear but with a fresh wave of furyi trusted you he shouted at lupin his voice wavering out of control and all the time youve been his friendyoure wrong said lupin i havent been siriuss friend but i am now let me explainno hermione screamed harry dont trust him hes been helping black get into the castle he wants you dead too hes a werewolfthere was a ringing silence everyones eyes were now on lupin who looked remarkably calm though rather palenot at all up to your usual standard hermione he said only one out of three im afraid i have not been helping sirius get into the castle and i certainly dont want harry dead an odd shiver passed over his face but i wont deny that i am a werewolfron made a valiant effort to get up again but fell back with a whimper of pain lupin made toward him looking concerned but ron gasped get away ftom me werewolflupin stopped dead then with an obvious effort he turned to hermione and said how long have you knownages hermione whispered since i did professor snapes essayhell be delighted said lupin coolly he assigned that essay hoping someone would realize what my symptoms meant did you check the lunar chart and realize that i was always ill at the full moon or did you realize that the boggart changed into the moon when it saw meboth hermione said quietlylupin forced a laughyoure the cleverest witch of your age ive ever met hermioneim not hermione whispered if id been a bit cleverer id have told everyone what you arebut they already know said lupin at least the staff dodumbledore hired you when he knew you were a werewolf ron gasped is he madsome of the staff thought so said lupin he had to work very hard to convince certain teachers that im trustworthy and he was wrong harry yelled youve been helping him all the timehe was pointing at black who suddenly crossed to the four poster bed and sank onto it his face hidden in one shaking hand crookshanks leapt up beside him and stepped onto his lap purring ron edged away from both of them dragging his legi have not been helping sirius said lupin if youll give me a chance ill explain look he separated harrys rons and hermiones wands and threw each back to its owner harry caught his stunnedthere said lupin sticking his own wand back into his belt youre armed were not now will you listenharry didnt know what to think was it a trickif you havent been helping him he said with a furious glance at black how did you know he was herethe map said lupin the marauders map i was in my office examining it you know how to work it harry said suspiciouslyof course i know how to work it said lupin waving his hand impatiently i helped write it im moony that was my friends nickname for me at schoolyou wrote the important thing is i was watching it carefully this eveningbecause i had an idea that you ron and hermione might try and sneak out of the castle to visit hagrid before his hippogriff was executedand i was right wasnt ihe had started to pace up and down looking at them little patches of dust rose at his feetyou might have been wearing your fathers old cloak harry how dyou know about the cloakthe number of times i saw james disappearing under it said lupinwaving an impatient hand again the point is even if youre wearing an invisibility cloak you still show up on the marauders map i watched you cross the grounds and enter hagrids hut twenty minutes later you left hagrid and set off back toward the castle but you were now accompanied by somebody elsewhat said harry no we werenti couldnt believe my eyes said lupin still pacing and ignoring harrys interruption i thought the map must be malfunctioning how could he be with you no one was with us said harryand then i saw another dot moving fast toward you labeled sirius black i saw him collide with you i watched as he pulled two of you into the whomping willow one of us ron said angrilyno ron said lupin two of youhe had stopped his pacing his eyes moving over rondo you think i could have a look at the rat he said evenlywhat said ron whats scabbers got to do with iteverything said lupin could i see him pleaseron hesitated then put a hand inside his robes scabbers emergedthrashing desperately ron had to seize his long bald tail to stop him escaping crookshanks stood up on blacks leg and made a soft hissing noiselupin moved closer to ron he seemed to be holding his breath as he gazed intently at scabberswhat ron said again holding scabbers close to him looking scaredwhats my rat got to do with anythingthats not a rat croaked sirius black suddenlywhat dyou mean of course hes a rat no hes not said lupin quietly hes a wizardan animagus said black by the name of peter pettigrewchapter eighteen moony wormtail paddfoot and prongsit took a few seconds for the absurdity of this statement to sink inthen ron voiced what harry was thinkingyoure both mentalridiculous said hermione faintlypeter pettigrews dead said harry he killed him twelve years agohe pointed at black whose face twitched convulsivelyi meant to he growled his yellow teeth bared but little peter got the better of me not this time thoughand crookshanks was thrown to the floor as black lunged at scabbers ron yelled with pain as blacks weight fell on his broken legsirius no lupin yelled launching himself forwards and dragging black away from ron again wait you cant do it just like that they need to understand weve got to explain we can explain afterwards snarled black trying to throw lupin offone hand was still clawing the air as it tried to reach scabbers who was squealing like a piglet scratching rons face and neck as he tried to escapetheyve got a right to know everything lupin panted still trying to restrain black rons kept him as a pet there are parts of it even i dont understand and harry you owe harry the truth siriusblack stopped struggling though his hollowed eyes were still fixed on scabbers who was clamped tightly under rons bitten scratched ad bleeding handsall right then black said without taking his eyes off the rattell them whatever you like but make it quick remus i want to commit the murder i was imprisoned foryoure nutters both of you said ron shakily looking round at harry and hermione for support ive had enough of this im offhe tried to heave himself up on his good leg but lupin raised his wand again pointing it at scabbersyoure going to hear me out ron he said quietly just keep a tight hold on peter while you listenhes not peter hes scabbers ron yelled trying to fore the rat back into his front pocket but scabbers was fighting to hard ron swayed and overbalanced and harry caught him am pushed him back down to the bedthen ignoring black harry turned to lupinthere were witnesses who saw pettigrew die he said a whole street full of themthey didnt see what they thought they saw said black savagely still watching scabbers struggling in rons handseveryone thought sirius killed peter said lupin nodding i believed it myself until i saw the map tonight because the marauders map never lies peters alive rons holding him harryharry looked down at ron and as their eyes met they agreed silentlyblack and lupin were both out of their minds their story made no sense whatsoever how could scabbers be peter pettigrew azkaban must have unhinged black after all but why was lupin playing along with himthen hermione spoke in a trembling would be calm sort of voice as though trying to will professor lupin to talk sensiblybut professor lupin scabbers cant be pettigrew it just cant be true you know it cantwhy cant it be true lupin said calmly as though they were in classand hermione had simply spotted a problem in an experiment with grindylowsbecause because people would know if peter pettigrew had been an animagus we did animagi in class with professor mcgonagall and i looked them up when i did my homework the ministry of magic keeps tabs on witches and wizards who can become animals theres a register showing what animal they become and their markings and things and i went and looked professor mcgonagall up on the register and there have been only seven animagi this century and pettigrews name wasnt on the listharry had barely had time to marvel inwardly at the effort hermione put into her homework when lupin started to laughlight again hermione he said but the ministry never knew that here used to be three unregistered animagi running around hogwartsi youre going to tell them the story get a move on remus said black who was still watching scabberss every desperate move ive waited twelve years im not going to wait much longerall right but youll need to help me sirius said lupin i only know how it beganlupin broke off there had been a loud creak behind him the bedroom door had opened of its own accord all five of them stared at it then lupin strode toward it and looked out into the landingno one therethis place is haunted said ronits not said lupin still looking at the door in a puzzled way the shrieking shack was never haunted the screams and howls the villagers used to hear were made by mehe pushed his graying hair out of his eyes thought for a moment then said thats where all of this starts with my becoming a werewolfnone of this could have happened if i hadnt been bitter and if i hadnt been so foolhardyhe looked sober and tired ron started to interrupt but hermione saidshh she was watching lupin very intentlyi as a very small boy when i received the bite my parents tried everything but in those days there was no cure the potion that professor snape has been making for me is a very recent discovery it makes me safe you see as long as i take it in the week preceding the full moon i keep my mind when i transform im able to curl up in my office a harmless wolf and wait for the moon to wane againbefore the wolfsbane potion was discovered however i became a fully fledged monster once a month it seemed impossible that i would be able to come to hogwarts other parents werent likely to want their children exposed to mebut then dumbledore became headmaster and he was sympathetic he said that as long as we took certain precautions there was no reason i shouldnt come to school lupin sighed and looked directly at harry i told you months ago that the whomping willow was planted the year i came to hogwarts the truth is that it was planted because i came to hogwarts this house lupin looked miserably around the room the tunnel that leads to it they were built for my use once a month i was smuggled out of the castle into this place to transformthe tree was placed at the tunnel mouth to stop anyone coming across me while i was dangerousharry couldnt see where this story was going but he was listening raptly all the same the only sound apart from lupins voice was scabberss frightened squeakingmy transformations in those days were were terrible it is very painful to turn into a werewolf i was separated from humans to bite so i bit and scratched myself instead the villagers heard the noise and the screaming and thought they were hearing particularly violent spirits dumbledore encouraged the rumor even now when the house has been silent for years the villagers dont dare approach itbut apart from my transformations i was happier than i had ever been in my life for the first time ever i had friends three great friendssirius black peter pettigrew and of course your father harry james potternow my three friends could hardly fail to notice that i disappeared once a month i made up all sorts of stories i told them my mother was ill and that i had to go home to see her i was terrified they would desert me the moment they found out what i was but of course theylike you hermione worked out the truthand they didnt desert me at all instead they did something for me that would make my transformations not only bearable but the best timesof my life they became animagimy dad too said harry astoundedyes indeed said lupin it took them the best part of three years to work out how to do it your father and sirius here were the cleverest students in the school and lucky they were because the animagus transformation can go horribly wrong one reason the ministry keeps a close watch on those attempting to do it peter needed all the help he could get from james and sirius finally in our fifth year they managed it they could each turn into a different animal at willbut how did that help you said hermione sounding puzzledthey couldnt keep me company as humans so they kept me company as animals said lupin a werewolf is only a danger to people they sneaked out of the castle every month under jamess invisibility cloakthey transformed peter as the smallest could slip beneath the willows attacking branches and touch the knot that freezes it they would then slip down the tunnel and join me under their influence i became less dangerous my body was still wolfish but my mind seemed to become less so while i was with themhurry up remus snarled black who was still watching scabbers with a horrible sort of hunger on his faceim getting there sirius im getting there well highly exciting possibilities were open to us now that we could all transform soon we were leaving the shrieking shack and roaming the school grounds and the village by night sirius and james transformed into such large animalsthey were able to keep a werewolf in check i doubt whether any hogwarts students ever found out more about the hogwarts grounds and hogsmeade than we did and thats how we came to write the marauders map and sign it with our nicknames sirius is padfoot peter is wormtail james was prongswhat sort of animal harry began but hermione cut him offthat was still really dangerous running around in the dark with a werewolf what if youd given the others the slip and bitten somebodya thought that still haunts me said lupin heavily and there were near misses many of them we laughed about them afterwards we were young thoughtless carried away with our own clevernessi sometimes felt guilty about betraying dumbledores trust of coursehe had admitted me to hogwarts when no other headmaster would have done so and he had no idea i was breaking the rules he had set down for my own and others safety he never knew i had led three fellow students into becoming animagi illegally but i always managed to forget my guilty feelings every time we sat down to plan our next months adventure and i havent changedlupins face had hardened and there was self disgust in his voice all this year i have been battling with myself wondering whether i should tell dumbledore that sirius was an animagus but i didnt do it whybecause i was too cowardly it would have meant admitting that id betrayed his trust while i was at school admitting that id led others along with me and dumbledores trust has meant everything to me he let me into hogwarts as a boy and he gave me a job when i have been shunned all my adult life unable to find paid work because of what i am and so i convinced myself that sirius was getting into the school using dark arts he learned from voldemort that being an animagus had nothing to do with it so in a way snapes been right about me all alongsnape said black harshly taking his eyes off scabbers for the first time in minutes and looking up at lupin whats snape got to do with ithes here sirius said lupin heavily hes teaching here as wellhe looked up at harry ron and hermioneprofessor snape was at school with us he fought very hard against my appointment to the defense against the dark arts job he has been telling dumbledore a year that i am not to be trusted he has his reasons you see sirius here played a trick on him which nearly killed him a trick which involved me black made a derisive noiseit served him right he sneered sneaking around trying to find out what we were up to hoping he could get us expelledseverus was very interested in where i went every month lupin told harry ron and hermione we were in the same year you know and we er didnt like each other very much he especially disliked jamesjealous i think of jamess talent on the quidditch field anyway snape had seen me crossing the grounds with madam pomfrey one evening as she led me toward the whomping willow to transform sirius thought it would be er amusing to tell snape all he had to do was prod the knot on the tree trunk with a long stick and hed be able to get in after me well of course snape tried it if hed got as far as this house hed have met a fully grown werewolf but your father whod heard what sirius had done went after snape and pulled him back at great risk to his life snape glimpsed me though at the end of the tunnel he was forbidden by dumbledore to tell anybody but from that time on he knew what i wasso thats why snape doesnt like you said harry slowly because he thought you were in on the jokethats right sneered a cold voice from the wall behind lupinseverus snape was pulling off the invisibility cloak his wand pointingdirectly at lupinchapter nineteen the servant of lord voldemorthermione screamed black leapt to his feet harry felt as though hed received a huge electric shocki found this at the base of the whomping willow said snape throwing the cloak aside careful to keep this wand pointing directly at lupins chest very useful potter i thank yousnape was slightly breathless but his face was full of suppressed triumph youre wondering perhaps how i knew you were here he saidhis eyes glittering ive just been to your office lupin you forgot to take your potion tonight so i took a gobletful along and very lucky i did lucky for me i mean lying on your desk was a certain map one glance at it told me all i needed to know i saw you running along this passageway and out of sightseverus lupin began but snape overrode himive told the headmaster again and again that youre helping your old friend black into the castle lupin and heres the proof not even i dreamed you would have the nerve to use this old place as your hideout severus youre making a mistake said lupin urgently you havent heard everything i can explain sirius is not here to kill harry two more for azkaban tonight said snape his eyes now gleaming fanatically i shall be interested to see how dumbledore takes thishe was quite convinced you were harmless you know lupin a tame werewolf you fool said lupin softly is a schoolboy grudge worth putting an innocent man back inside azkabanbang thin snakelike cords burst from the end of snapes wand and twisted themselves around lupins mouth wrists and ankles he overbalanced and fell to the floor unable to move with a roar of rageblack started toward snape but snape pointed his wand straight between blacks eyesgive me a reason he whispered give me a reason to do it and i swear i willblack stopped dead it would have been impossible to say which face showed more hatredharry stood there paralyzed not knowing what to do or whom to believehe glanced around at ron and hermione ron looked just as confused as he did still fighting to keep hold on the struggling scabbers hermionehowever took an uncertain step toward snape and said in a very breathless voice professor snape it it wouldnt hurt to hear what theyve got to say w would itmiss granger you are already facing suspension from this schoolsnape spat you potter and weasley are out of bounds in the company of a convicted murderer and a werewolf for once in your life hold your tonguebut if if there was a mistake keep quiet you stupid girl snape shouted looking suddenly quite deranged dont talk about what you dont understand a few sparks shot out of the end of his wand which was still pointed at blacks face hermione fell silentvengeance is very sweet snape breathed at black how i hoped i would be the one to catch youthe jokes on you again severus black snarled as long as this boy brings his rat up to the castle he jerked his head at ron ill come quietlyup to the castle said snape silkily i dont think we need to go that far all i have to do is call the dementors once we get out of the willow theyll be very pleased to see you black pleased enough to give you a little kiss i daresay i what little color there was in blacks face left ityou youve got to hear me out he croaked the rat look at the rat but there was a mad glint in snapes eyes that harry had never seen before he seemed beyond reasoncome on all of you he said he clicked his fingers and the ends of the cords that bound lupin flew to his hands ill drag the werewolfperhaps the dementors will have a kiss for him too before he knew what he was doing harry had crossed the room in three strides and blocked the doorget out of the way potter youre in enough trouble already snarled snape if i hadnt been here to save your skin professor lupin could have killed me about a hundred times this yearharry said ive been alone with him loads of times having defense lessons against the dementors if he was helping black why didnt he just finish me off thendont ask me to fathom the way a werewolfs mind works hissed snapeget out of the way potteryoure pathetic harry yelled just because they made a fool of you at school you wont even listen silence i will not be spoken to like that snape shriekedlooking madder than ever like father like son potter i have just saved your neck you should be thanking me on bended knee you would have been well served if hed killed you youd have died like your father too arrogant to believe you might be mistaken in black now get out of the way or i will make you get out of the way potterharry made up his mind in a split second before snape could take even one step toward him he had raised his wandexpelliarmus he yelled except that his wasnt the only voice that shouted there was a blast that made the door rattle on its hinges snape was lifted off his feet and slammed into the wall then slid down it to the floor a trickle of blood oozing from under his hair he had been knocked outharry looked around both ron and hermione had tried to disarm snape at exactly the same moment snapes wand soared in a high arc and landed on the bed next to crookshanksyou shouldnt have done that said black looking at harryyou should have left him to meharry avoided blacks eyes he wasnt sure even now that hed done the right thingwe attacked a teacher we attacked a teacher hermione whimperedstaring at the lifeless snape with frightened eyes oh were going to be in so much trouble lupin was struggling against his bonds black bent down quickly and untied him lupin straightened up rubbing his arms where the ropes had cut into themthank you harry he saidim still not saying i believe you he told lupinthen its time we offered you some proof said lupin you boy give me peter please nowron clutched scabbers closer to his chestcome off it he said weakly are you trying to say he broke out of azkaban just to get his hands on scabbers i mean he looked up at harry and hermione for support okay say pettigrew could turn into a rat there are millions of rats hows he supposed to know which one hes after if he was locked up in azkabanyou know sirius thats a fair question said lupin turning to black and frowning slightly how did you find out where he wasblack put one of his clawlike hands inside his robes and took out a crumpled piece of paper which he smoothed flat and held out to show the othersit was the photograph of ron and his family that had appeared in the daily prophet the previous summer and there on rons shoulder was scabbershow did you get this lupin asked black thunderstruckfudge said black when he came to inspect azkaban last year he gave me his paper and there was peter on the front page on this boys shoulder i knew him at once how many times had i seen him transform and the caption said the boy would be going back to hogwarts to where harry wasmy god said lupin softly staring from scabbers to the picture in the paper and back again his front pawwhat about it said ron defiantlyhes got a toe missing said blackof course lupin breathed so simple so brilliant he cut it off himselfjust before he transformed said black when i cornered him he yelled for the whole street to hear that id betrayed lily and jamesthen before i could curse him he blew apart the street with the wand behind his back killed everyone within twenty feet of himself and sped down into the sewer with the other ratsdidnt you ever hear ron said lupin the biggest bit of peter they found was his fingerlook scabbers probably had a fight with another rat or something hes been in my family for ages right twelve years in fact said lupin didnt you ever wonder why he was living so longwe weve been taking good care of him said ronnot looking too good at the moment though is he said lupin id guess hes been losing weight ever since he heard sirius was on the loose againhes been scared of that mad cat said ron nodding toward crookshanks who was still purring on the bedbut that wasnt right harry thought suddenly scabbers had been looking ill before he met crookshanks ever since rons return from egypt since the time when black had escapedthis cat isnt mad said black hoarsely he reached out a bony hand and stroked crookshankss fluffy head hes the most intelligent of his kind ive ever met he recognized peter for what he was right away and when he met me he knew i was no dog it was a while before he trusted me finally i managed to communicate to him what i was after and hes been helping me what do you mean breathed hermionehe tried to bring peter to me but couldnt so he stole the passwords into gryffindor tower for me as i understand it he took them from a boys bedside tableharrys brain seemed to be sagging under the weight of what he was hearing it was absurd and yetbut peter got wind of what was going on and ran for it croaked blackthis cat crookshanks did you call him told me peter had left blood on the sheets i supposed he bit himself well faking his own death had worked oncethese words jolted harry to his sensesand why did he fake his death he said furiously because he knew you were about to kill him like you killed my parentsno said lupin harry and now youve come to finish him offyes i have said black with an evil look at scabbersthen i shouldve let snape take you harry shoutedharry said lupin hurriedly dont you see all this time wevethought sirius betrayed your parents and peter tracked him down but it was the other way around dont you see peter betrayed your mother and father sirius tracked peter down thats not true harry yelled he was their secret keeper he said so before you turned up he said he killed themhe was pointing at black who shook his head slowly the sunken eyes were suddenly over brightharry i as good as killed them he croaked i persuaded lily and james to change to peter at the last moment persuaded them to use him as secret keeper instead of me im to blame i know it the night they died id arranged to check on peter make sure he was still safebut when i arrived at his hiding place hed gone yet there was no sign of a struggle it didnt feel right i was scared i set out for your parents house straight away and when i saw their house destroyed and their bodies i realized what peter mustve done what id donehis voice broke he turned awayenough of this said lupin and there was a steely note in his voice harry had never heard before theres one certain way to prove what really happened ron give me that ratwhat are you going to do with him if i give him to you ron asked lupin tenselyforce him to show himself said lupin if he really is a rat it wont hurt himron hesitated then at long last he held out scabbers and lupin took him scabbers began to squeak without stopping twisting and turninghis tiny black eyes bulging in his head ready sirius said lupinblack had already retrieved snapes wand from the bed he approached lupin and the struggling rat and his wet eyes suddenly seemed to be burning in his facetogether he said quietlyi think so said lupin holding scabbers tightly in one hand and his wand in the other on the count of three one two threea flash of blue white light erupted from both wands for a momentscabbers was frozen in midair his small gray form twisting madly ron yelled the rat fell and hit the floor there was another blinding flash of light and then it was like watching a speeded up film of a growing tree a head was shooting upward from the ground limbs were sprouting a moment later a man was standing where scabbers had been cringing and wringing his hands crookshanks was spitting and snarling on the bed the hair on his back was standing uphe was a very short man hardly taller than harry and hermione his thin colorless hair was unkempt and there was a large bald patch on top he had the shrunken appearance of a plump man who has lost a lot of weight in a short time his skin looked grubby almost like scabberss fur and something of the rat lingered around his pointed nose and his very small watery eyes he looked around at them all his breathing fast and shallow harry saw his eyes dart to the door and back againwell hello peter said lupin pleasantly as though rats frequently erupted into old school friends around him long time no sees sirius r remus even pettigrews voice was squeakyagain his eyes darted toward the door my friends my old friendsblacks wand arm rose but lupin seized him around the wrist gave him a warning took then turned again to pettigrew his voice light and casualweve been having a little chat peter about what happened the night lily and james died you might have missed the finer points while you were squeaking around down there on the bed remus gasped pettigrew and harry could see beads of sweat breakingout over his pasty face you dont believe him do you he tried to kill me remusso weve heard said lupin more coldly id like to clear up one or two little matters with you peter if youll be so hes come to try and kill me again pettigrew squeaked suddenlypointing at black and harry saw that he used his middle finger because his index was missing he killed lily and james and now hes going to kill me too youve got to help me remusblacks face looked more skull like than ever as he stared at pettigrew with his fathomless eyesno ones going to try and kill you until weve sorted a few things out said lupinsorted things out squealed pettigrew looking wildly about him once more eyes taking in the boarded windows and again the only door i knew hed come after me i knew hed be back for me ive been waiting for this for twelve yearsyou knew sirius was going to break out of azkaban said lupin his brow furrowed when nobody has ever done it beforehes got dark powers the rest of us can only dream of pettigrew shouted shrilly how else did he get out of there i suppose he who must not be named taught him a few tricksblack started to laugh a horrible mirthless laugh that filled the whole roomvoldemort teach me tricks he saidpettigrew flinched as though black had brandished a whip at himwhat scared to hear your old masters name said black i dont blame you peter his lot arent very happy with you are theydont know what you mean sirius muttered pettigrew his breathingfaster than ever his whole face was shining with sweat nowyou havent been hiding from me for twelve years said black youve been hiding from voldemorts old supporters i heard things in azkabanpeter they all think youre dead or youd have to answer to themive heard them screaming all sorts of things in their sleep sounds like they think the double crosser double crossed them voldemort went to the potters on your information and voldemort met his downfall there and not all voldemorts supporters ended up in azkaban did theythere are still plenty out here biding their time pretending theyve seen the error of their waysif they ever got wind that you were still alive peter dont know what youre talking about said pettigrew again more shrilly than ever he wiped his face on his sleeve and looked up at lupin you dont believe this this madness remus i must admit peter i have difficulty in understanding why an innocent man would want to spend twelve years as a rat said lupin evenlyinnocent but scared squealed pettigrew if voldemorts supporters were after me it was because i put one of their best men in azkaban the spy sirius blackblacks face contortedhow dare you he growled sounding suddenly like the bearsized dog he had been i a spy for voldemort when did i ever sneak around people who were stronger and more powerful than myself but you peter ill never understand why i didnt see you were the spy from the start you always liked big friends whod look after you didnt you it used to be us me and remus and jamespettigrew wiped his face again he was almost panting for breathme a spy must be out of your mind never dont know how you can say such a lily and james only made you secret keeper because i suggested itblack hissed so venomously that pettigrew took a step backward i thought it was the perfect plan a bluff voldemort would be sure to come after me would never dream theyd use a weak talentless thing like you it must have been the finest moment of your miserable lifetelling voldemort you could hand him the potterspettigrew was muttering distractedly harry caught words like far fetched and lunacy but he couldnt help paying more attention to the ashen color of pettigrews face and the way his eyes continued to dart toward the windows and doorprofessor lupin said hermione timidly can can i say somethingcertainly hermione said lupin courteouslywell scabbers i mean this this man hes been sleeping in harrys dormitory for three years if hes working for you know who how come he never tried to hurt harry before nowthere said pettigrew shrilly pointing at ron with his maimed handthank you you see remus i have never hurt a hair of harrys headwhy should iill tell you why said black because you never did anything for anyone unless you could see what was in it for you voldemorts been in hiding for fifteen years they say hes half dead you werent about to commit murder right under albus dumbledores nose for a wreck of a wizard whod lost all of his power were you youd want to be quite sure he was the biggest bully in the playground before you went back to him wouldnt you why else did you find a wizard family to take you inkeeping an ear out for news werent you peter just in case your old protector regained strength and it was safe to rejoin himpettigrew opened his mouth and closed it several times he seemed to have lost the ability to talker mr black sirius said hermioneblack jumped at being addressed like this and stared at hermione as though he had never seen anything quite like herif you dont mind me asking how how did you get out of azkaban if you didnt use dark magicthank you gasped pettigrew nodding frantically at her exactlyprecisely what i but lupin silenced him with a look black was frowning slightly at hermione but not as though he were annoyed with her he seemed to be pondering his answeri dont know how i did it he said slowly i think the only reason i never lost my mind is that i knew i was innocent that wasnt a happy thought so the dementors couldnt suck it out of me but it kept me sane and knowing who i am helped me keep my powers so when it all became too much i could transform in my cell become a dogdementors cant see you know he swallowed they feel their way toward people by feeding off their emotions they could tell that my feelings were less less human less complex when i was a dog but they thought of course that i was losing my mind like everyone else in there so it didnt trouble them but i was weak very weak and i had no hope of driving them away from me without a wandbut then i saw peter in that picture i realized he was at hogwarts with harry perfectly positioned to act if one hint reached his ears that the dark side was gathering strength againpettigrew was shaking his head mouthing noiselessly but staring all the while at black as though hypnotizedready to strike at the moment he could be sure of allies and to deliver the last potter to them if he gave them harry whod dare say hed betrayed lord voldemort hed be welcomed back with honorsso you see i had to do something i was the only one who knew peter was still aliveharry remembered what mr weasley had told mrs wealsey the guards say hes been talking in his sleep always the same words hes at hogwartsÃ¢â‚¬Å“it was as if someone had lit a fire in my head and the dementors couldnt destroy it it wasnt a happy feeling it was an obsession but it gave me strength it cleared my mind so one night when they opened my door to bring food i slipped past them as a dogits so much harder for them to sense animal emotions that they were confused i was thin very thin thin enough to slip through the bars i swam as a dog back to the mainland i journeyed north and slipped into the hogwarts grounds as a dog ive been living in the forest ever since except when i came to watch the quidditch of courseyou fly as well as your father did harryhe looked at harry who did not look awaybelieve me croaked black believe me harry i never betrayed james and lily i would have died before i betrayed themand at long last harry believed him throat too tight to speak he noddednopettigrew had fallen to his knees as though harrys nod had been his own death sentence he shuffled forward on his knees groveling his hands clasped in front of him as though prayingsirius its me its peter your friend you wouldnt black kicked out and pettigrew recoiledtheres enough filth on my robes without you touching them said blackremus pettigrew squeaked turning to lupin instead writhing imploringly in front of him you dont believe this wouldnt sirius have told you theyd changed the plannot if he thought i was the spy peter said lupin i assume thats why you didnt tell me sirius he said casually over pettigrews headforgive me remus said blacknot at all padfoot old friend said lupin who was now rolling up his sleeves and will you in turn forgive me for believing you were the spyof course said black and the ghost of a grin flitted across his gaunt face he too began rolling up his sleeves shall we kill him togetheryes i think so said lupin grimlyyou wouldnt you wont gasped pettigrew and he scrambled around to ronron havent i been a good friend a good pet you wont let them kill me ron will you youre on my side arent youbut ron was staring at pettigrew with the utmost revulsioni let you sleep in my bed he saidkind boy kind master pettigrew crawled toward ron you wont let them do it i was your rat i was a good petif you made a better rat than a human its not much to boast aboutpeter said black harshly ron going still paler with pain wrenched his broken leg out of pettigrews reach pettigrew turned on his kneesstaggered forward and seized the hem of hermiones robessweet girl clever girl you you wont let them help mehermione pulled her robes out of pettigrews clutching hands and backed away against the wall looking horrifiedpettigrew knelt trembling uncontrollably and turned his head slowly toward harryharry harry you look just like your father just like himhow dare you speak to harry roared black how dare you face him how dare you talk about james in front of himharry whispered pettigrew shuffling toward him hands outstretchedharry james wouldnt have wanted me killed james would have understood harry he would have shown me mercyboth black and lupin strode forward seized pettigrews shoulders and threw him backward onto the floor he sat there twitching with terrorstaring up at themyou sold lily and james to voldemort said black who was shaking toodo you deny itpettigrew burst into tears it was horrible to watch like an oversizedbalding baby cowering on the floorsirius sirius what could i have done the dark lord you have no idea he has weapons you cant imagine i was scared sirius i was never brave like you and remus and james i never meant it to happenhe who must not be named forced me dont lie bellowed black youd been passing information to him for a year before lily and james died you were his spyhe he was taking over everywhere gasped pettigrew wh what was there to be gained by refusing himwhat was there to be gained by fighting the most evil wizard who has ever existed said black with a terrible fury in his face only innocent lives peteryou dont understand whined pettigrew he would have killed mesiriusthen you should have died roared black died rather than betray your friends as we would have done for youblack and lupin stood shoulder to shoulder wands raisedyou should have realized said lupin quietly if voldemort didnt kill you we would good bye peterhermione covered her face with her hands and turned to the wallno harry yelled he ran forward placing himself in front pettigrewfacing the wands you cant kill him he said breathlessly you cantblack and lupin both looked staggeredharry this piece of vermin is the reason you have no parents black snarled this cringing bit of filth would have seen you die toowithout turning a hair you heard him his own stinking skin meant more to him than your whole familyi know harry panted well take him up to the castle well hand him over to the dementors he can go to azkaban but dont kill himharry gasped pettigrew and he flung his arms around harrys kneesyou thank you its more than i deserve thank you get off me harry spat throwing pettigrews hands off him in disgustim not doing this for you im doing it because i dont reckon my dad wouldve wanted them to become killers just for youno one moved or made a sound except pettigrew whose breath was coming in wheezes as he clutched his chest black and lupin were looking at each other then with one movement they lowered their wandsyoure the only person who has the right to decide harry said blackbut think think what he didhe can go to azkaban harry repeated if anyone deserves that placehe doespettigrew was still wheezing behind himvery well said lupin stand aside harryharry hesitatedim going to tie him up said lupin thats all i swearharry stepped out of the way thin cords shot from lupins wand this time and next moment pettigrew was wriggling on the floor bound and gaggedbut if you transform peter growled black his own wand pointing at pettigrew too we will kill you you agree harryharry looked down at the pitiful figure on the floor and nodded so that pettigrew could see himright said lupin suddenly businesslike ron i cant mend bones nearly as well as madam pomfrey so i think its best if we just strap your leg up until we can get you to the hospital winghe hurried over to ron bent down tapped rons leg with his wand and muttered ferula bandages spun up rons leg strapping it tightly to a splint lupin helped him to his feet ron put his weight gingerly on the leg and didnt wincethats better he said thankswhat about professor snape said hermione in a small voice looking down at snapes prone figuretheres nothing seriously wrong with him said lupin bending over snape and checking his pulse you were just a little overenthusiastic still out cold er perhaps it will be best if we dont revive him until were safety back in the castle we can take him like thishe muttered mobilicorpus as though invisible strings were tied to snapes wrists neck and knees he was pulled into a standing positionhead still lolling unpleasantly like a grotesque puppet he hung a fewinches above the ground his limp feet dangling lupin picked up the invisibility cloak and tucked it safely into his pocketand two of us should be chained to this said black nudging pettigrew with his toe just to make sureill do it said lupinand me said ron savagely limping forwardblack conjured heavy manacles from thin air soon pettigrew was upright again left arm chained to lupins right right arm to rons left rons face was set he seemed to have taken scabberss true identity as a personal insult crookshanks leapt lightly off the bed and led the way out of the room his bottlebrush tail held jauntily highchapter twenty the dementors kissharry had never been part of a stranger group crookshanks led the way down the stairs lupin pettigrew and ron went next looking like entrants in a six legged race next came professor snape drifting creepily along his toes hitting each stair as they descended held up by his own wand which was being pointed at him by sirius harry and hermione brought up the reargetting back into the tunnel was difficult lupin pettigrew and ron had to turn sideways to manage it lupin still had pettigrew covered with his wand harry could see them edging awkwardly along the tunnel in single file crookshanks was still in the lead harry went right after black who was still making snape drift along ahead of them he kept bumping his lolling head on the low ceiling harry had the impression black was making no effort to prevent thisyou know what this means black said abruptly to harry as they made their slow progress along the tunnel turning pettigrew inyou re free said harryyes said black but im also i dont know if anyone ever told you im your godfatheryeah i knew that said harrywell your parents appointed me your guardian said black stifflyif anything happened to themharry waited did black mean what he thought he meantill understand of course if you want to stay with your aunt and uncle said black but well think about it once my names cleared if you wanted a a different homesome sort of explosion took place in the pit of harrys stomachwhat live with you he said accidentally cracking his head on a bit of rock protruding from the ceiling leave the dursleysof course i thought you wouldnt want to said black quickly i understand i just thought id are you insane said harry his voice easily as croaky as blacksof course i want to leave the dursleys have you got a house when can i move inblack turned right around to look at him snapes head was scraping the ceiling but black didnt seem to careyou want to he said you mean ityeah i mean it said harryblacks gaunt face broke into the first true smile harry had seen upon it the difference it made was startling as though a person ten years younger were shining through the starved mask for a moment he was recognizable as the man who had laughed at harrys parents weddingthey did not speak again until they had reached the end of the tunnelcrookshanks darted up first he had evidently pressed his paw to the knot on the trunk because lupin pettigrew and ron clambered upward without any sound of savaging branchesblack saw snape up through the hole then stood back for harry and hermione to pass at last all of them were outthe grounds were very dark now the only light came from the distant windows of the castle without a word they set off pettigrew was still wheezing and occasionally whimpering harrys mind was buzzing he was going to leave the dursleys he was going to live with sirius black his parents best friend he felt dazed what would happen when he told the dursleys he was going to live with the convict theyd seen on television one wrong move peter said lupin threateningly ahead his wand was still pointed sideways at pettigrews chestsilently they tramped through the grounds the castle lights growing slowly larger snape was still drifting weirdly ahead of black his chin bumping on his chest and then a cloud shifted there were suddenly dim shadows on the ground their party was bathed in moonlightsnape collided with lupin pettigrew and ron who had stopped abruptlyblack froze he flung out one arm to make harry and hermione stopharry could see lupins silhouette he had gone rigid then his limbs began to shakeoh my hermione gasped he didnt take his potion tonight hes not saferun black whispered run nowbut harry couldnt run ron was chained to pettigrew and lupin he leapt forward but black caught him around the chest and threw him backleave it to me runthere was a terrible snarling noise lupins head was lengthening so was his body his shoulders were hunching hair was sprouting visibly on his face and hands which were curling into clawed paws crookshankss hair was on end again he was backing away as the werewolf reared snapping its long jaws sirius disappeared from harrys side he had transformed the enormous bearlike dog bounded forward as the werewolf wrenched itself free of the manacle binding itthe dog seized it about the neck and pulled it backward away from ron and pettigrew they were locked jaw to jaw claws ripping at each otherharry stood transfixed by the sight too intent upon the battle to notice anything else it was hermiones scream that alerted him pettigrew had dived for lupins dropped wand ron unsteady on his bandaged leg fell there was a bang a burst of light and ron lay motionless on the ground another bang crookshanks flew into the air and back to the earth in a heapexpelliarmus harry yelled pointing his own wand at pettigrew lupins wand flew high into the air and out of sight stay where you are harry shouted running forwardtoo late pettigrew had transformed harry saw his bald tail whip through the manacle on rons outstretched arm and heard a scurrying through the grassthere was a howl and a rumbling growl harry turned to see the werewolf taking flight it was galloping into the forest sirius hes gone pettigrew transformed harry yelledblack was bleeding there were gashes across his muzzle and back but at harrys words he scrambled up again and in an instant the sound of his paws faded to silence as he pounded away across the groundsharry and hermione dashed over to ronwhat did he do to him hermione whispered rons eyes were onlyhalf closed his mouth hung open he was definitely alive they could hear him breathing but he didnt seem to recognize themi dont knowharry looked desperately around black and lupin both gone they had no one but snape for company still hanging unconscious in midairwed better get them up to the castle and tell someone said harrypushing his hair out of his eyes trying to think straight come but then from beyond the range of their vision they heard a yelping a whining a dog in painsirius harry muttered staring into the darknesshe had a moments indecision but there was nothing they could do for ron at the moment and by the sound of it black was in trouble harry set off at a run hermione right behind him the yelping seemed to be coming from the ground near the edge of the lake they pelted toward it and harry running flat out felt the cold without realizing what it must mean the yelping stopped abruptly as they reached the lakeshore they saw why sirius had turned back into a man he was crouched on all fourshis hands over his headnooo he moaned nooo pleaseand then harry saw them dementors at least a hundred of them gliding in a black mass around the lake toward them he spun around the familiar icy cold penetrating his insides fog starting to obscure his vision more were appearing out of the darkness on every side they were encircling themherrnione think of something happy harry yelled raising his wandblinking furiously to try and clear his vision shaking his head to rid it of the faint screaming that had started inside it im going to live with my godfather im leaving the dursleyshe forced himself to think of black and only black and began to chantexpecto patronum expecto patronumblack gave a shudder rolled over and lay motionless on the groundpale as deathhell be all right im going to go and live with himexpecto patronum hermione help me expecto patronumexpecto hermione whispered expecto expecto but she couldnt do it the dementors were closing in barely ten feet from them they formed a solid wall around harry and hermione and were getting closerexpecto patronum harry yelled trying to blot the screaming from his ears expecto patronuma thin wisp of silver escaped his wand and hovered like mist before himat the same moment harry felt hermione collapse next to him he was alone completely aloneexpecto expecto patronum harry felt his knees hit the cold grass fog was clouding his eyes with a huge effort he fought to remember sirius was innocent innocent well be okay i mgoing to live with him ex ecto patronum he gaspedby the feeble light of his formless patronus he saw a dementor haltvery close to him it couldnt walk through the cloud of silver mist harry had conjured a dead slimy hand slid out from under the cloak it made a gesture as though to sweep the patronus asideno no harry gasped hes innocent expecto expecto patronum he could feet them watching him hear their rattling breath like an evil wind around him the nearest dementor seemed to be considering him then it raised both its rotting hands and lowered its hoodwhere there should have been eyes there was only thin gray scabbed skin stretched blankly over empty sockets but there was a mouth a gaping shapeless hole sucking the air with the sound of a death rattlea paralyzing terror filled harry so that he couldnt move or speak his patronus flickered and diedwhite fog was blinding him he had to fight expecto patronum he couldnt see and in the distance he heard the familiar screamingexpecto patronum he groped in the mist for sirius and found his arm they werent going to take himbut a pair of strong clammy hands suddenly attached themselves around harrys neck they were forcing his face upward he could feel its breath it was going to get rid of him first he could feel its putrid breath his mother was screaming in his ears she was going to be the last thing he ever heard and then through the fog that was drowning him he thought he saw a silvery light growing brighter and brighter he felt himself fall forward onto the grass facedown too weak to move sick and shakingharry opened his eyes the dementor must have released him the blinding light was illuminating the grass around him the screaming had stopped the cold was ebbing awaysomething was driving the dementors back it was circling around him and black and hermione they were leavingthe air was warm againwith every ounce of strength he could muster harry raised his head a few inches and saw an animal amid the light galloping away across the lake eyes blurred with sweat harry tried to make out what it was it was as bright as a unicorn fighting to stay consciousharry watched it canter to a halt as it reached the opposite shore for a moment harry saw by its brightness somebody welcoming it backraising his hand to pat it someone who looked strangely familiar but it couldnt beharry didnt understand he couldnt think anymore he felt the last of his strength leave him and his head hit the ground as he faintedchapter twenty one hermiones secretshocking business shocking miracle none of them died never heard the like by thunder it was lucky you were there snapethank you ministerorder of merlin second class id say first class if i can wangle itthank you very much indeed ministernasty cut youve got there blacks work i supposeas a matter of fact it was potter weasley and granger ministernoblack had bewitched them i saw it immediately a confundus charm to judge by their behavior they seemed to think there was a possibility he was innocent they werent responsible for their actions on the other hand their interference might have permitted black to escape they obviously thought they were going to catch black single handed theyve got away with a great deal before now im afraid its given them a rather high opinion of themselves and of course potter has always been allowed an extraordinary amount of license by the headmaster ah well snape harry potter you know weve all got a bit of a blind spot where hes concernedand yet is it good for him to be given so much special treatmentpersonally i try and treat him like any other student and any other student would be suspended at the very least for leading his friends into such danger consider minister against all school rules after all the precautions put in place for his protection out of bounds at night consorting with a werewolf and a murderer and i have reason to believe he has been visiting hogsmeade illegally too well well we shall see snape we shall see the boy has undoubtedly been foolishharry lay listening with his eyes tight shut he felt very groggy the words he was hearing seemed to be traveling very slowly from his ears to his brain so that it was difficult to understand his limbs felt like lead his eyelids too heavy to lift he wanted to lie here on this comfortable bed foreverwhat amazes me most is the behavior of the dementors youve really no idea what made them retreat snapeno minister by the time i had come round they were heading back to their positions at the entrancesextraordinary and yet black and harry and the girl all unconscious by the time i reached them i bound and gagged blacknaturally conjured stretchers and brought them all straight back to the castlethere was a pause harrys brain seemed to be moving a little fasterand as it did a gnawing sensation grew in the pit of his stomachhe opened his eyeseverything was slightly blurred somebody had removed his glasses he was lying in the dark hospital wing at the very end of the ward he could make out madam pomfrey with her back to him bending over a bedharry squinted rons red hair was visible beneath madam pomfreys armharry moved his head over on the pillow in the bed to his right lay hermione moonlight was falling across her bed her eyes were open tooshe looked petrified and when she saw that harry was awake pressed a finger to her lips then pointed to the hospital wing door it was ajarand the voices of cornelius fudge and snape were coming through it from the corridor outsidemadam pomfrey now came walking briskly up the dark ward to harrys bedhe turned to took at her she was carrying the largest block of chocolate he had ever seen in his life it looked like a small boulderah youre awake she said briskly she placed the chocolate on harrys bedside table and began breaking it apart with a small hammerhows ron said harry and hermione togetherhell live said madam pomfrey grimly as for you two youll be staying here until im satisfied youre potter what do you think youre doingharry was sitting up putting his glasses back on and picking up his wandi need to see the headmaster he saidpotter said madam pomfrey soothingly its all right theyve got black hes locked away upstairs the dementors will be performing the kiss any moment now whatharry jumped up out of bed hermione had done the same but his shout had been heard in the corridor outside next second cornelius fudge and snape had entered the wardharry harry whats this said fudge looking agitated you should be in bed has he had any chocolate he asked madam pomfrey anxiouslyminister listen harry said sirius blacks innocent peterpettigrew faked his own death we saw him tonight you cant let the dementors do that thing to sirius hes but fudge was shaking his head with a small smile on his faceharry harry youre very confused youve been through a dreadful ordeal lie back down now weve got everything under controlyou havent harry yelled youve got the wrong manminister listen please hermione said she had hurried to harrys side and was gazing imploringly into fudges face i saw him too it was rons rat hes an animagus pettigrew i mean and you see minister said snape confunded both of them blacks done a very good job on them were not confunded harry roaredminister professor said madam pomfrey angrily i must insist that you leave potter is my patient and he should not be distressedim not distressed im trying to tell them what happened harry said furiously if theyd just listen but madam pomfrey suddenly stuffed a large chunk of chocolate into harrys mouth he choked and she seized the opportunity to force him back onto the bednow please minister these children need care please leave the door opened again it was dumbledore harry swallowed his mouthful of chocolate with great difficulty and got up againprofessor dumbledore sirius black for heavens sake said madam pomfrey hysterically is this a hospital wing or not headmaster i must insist my apologies poppy but i need a word with mr potter and miss granger said dumbledore calmly i have just been talking to sirius black i suppose hes told you the same fairy tale hes planted in potters mind spat snape something about a rat and pettigrew being alive that indeed is blacks story said dumbledore surveying snape closely through his half moon spectaclesand does my evidence count for nothing snarled snape peter pettigrew was not in the shrieking shack nor did i see any sign of him on the groundsthat was because you were knocked out professor said hermione earnestly you didnt arrive in time to hear miss granger hold your tonguenow snape said fudge startled the young lady is disturbed in her mind we must make allowances i would like to speak to harry and hermione alone said dumbledore abruptly cornelius severus poppy please leave usheadmaster sputtered madam pomfrey they need treatment they need rest this cannot wait said dumbledore i must insistmadam pomfrey pursed her lips and strode away into her office at the end of the ward slamming the door behind her fudge consulted the large gold pocket watch dangling from his waistcoatthe dementors should have arrived by now he said ill go and meet them dumbledore ill see you upstairshe crossed to the door and held it open for snape but snape hadnt movedyou surely dont believe a word of blacks story snape whispered his eyes fixed on dumbledores facei wish to speak to harry and hermione alone dumbledore repeatedsnape took a step toward dumbledoresirius black showed he was capable of murder at the age of sixteen he breathed you havent forgotten that headmaster you havent forgotten that he once tried to kill memy memory is as good as it ever was severus said dumbledore quietlysnape turned on his heel and marched through the door fudge was still holding it closed behind them and dumbledore turned to harry and hermione they both burst into speech at the same timeprofessor blacks telling the truth we saw pettigrew he escaped when professor lupin turned into a werewolf hes a rat pettigrews front paw i mean finger he cut it off pettigrew attacked ron it wasnt sirius but dumbledore held up his hand to stem the flood of explanationsit is your turn to listen and i beg you will not interrupt me because there is very little time he said quietly there is not a shred of proof to support blacks story except your word and the word of two thirteen year old wizards will not convince anybody a street full of eyewitnesses swore they saw sirius murder pettigrew i myself gave evidence to the ministry that sirius had been the potters secret keeperprofessor lupin can tell you harry said unable to stop himself professor lupin is currently deep in the forest unable to tell anyone anything by the time he is human again it will be too late sirius will be worse than dead i might add that werewolves are so mistrusted by most of our kind that his support will count for very little and the fact that he and sirius are old friends but listen to me harry it is too late you understand me you must see that professor snapes version of events is far more convincing than yourshe hates sirius hermione said desperately all because of some stupid trick sirius played on him sirius has not acted like an innocent man the attack on the fat lady entering gryffindor tower with a knife without pettigrew alive or dead we have no chance of overturning siriuss sentencebut you believe usyes i do said dumbledore quietly but i have no power to make other men see the truth or to overrule the minister of magicharry stared up into the grave face and felt as though the ground beneath him were falling sharply away he had grown used to the idea that dumbledore could solve anything he had expected dumbledore to pull some amazing solution out of the air but no their last hope was gonewhat we need said dumbledore slowly and his light blue eyes moved from harry to hermione is more timebut hermione began and then her eyes became very round ohnow pay attention said dumbledore speaking very low and very clearly sirius is locked in professor flitwicks office on the seventh floor thirteenth window from the right of the west tower if all goes well you will be able to save more than one innocent life tonight but remember this both of you you must not be seen miss granger you know the law you know what is at stake you must not be seenharry didnt have a clue what was going on dumbledore had turned on his heel and looked back as he reached the doori am going to lock you in it is he consulted his watch five minutes to midnight miss granger three turns should do it good luckgood luck harry repeated as the door closed behind dumbledore three turns whats he talking about what are we supposed to dobut hermione was fumbling with the neck of her robes pulling from beneath them a very long very fine gold chainharry come here she said urgently quickharry moved toward her completely bewildered she was holding the chain out he saw a tiny sparkling hourglass hanging from ithere she had thrown the chain around his neck tooready she said breathlesslywhat are we doing harry said completely losthermione turned the hourglass over three timesthe dark ward dissolved harry had the sensation that he was flying very fast backward a blur of colors and shapes rushed past him his ears were pounding he tried to yell but couldnt hear his own voice and then he felt solid ground beneath his feet and everything came into focus again he was standing next to hermione in the deserted entrance hall and a stream of golden sunlight was falling across the paved floor from the open front doors he looked wildly around at hermione the chain of the hourglass cutting into his neckhermione what in here hermione seized harrys arm and dragged him across the hallto the door of a broom closet she opened it pushed him inside among the buckets and mops then slammed the door behind themwhat how hermione what happenedweve gone back in time hermione whispered lifting the chain off harrys neck in the darkness three hours backharry found his own leg and gave it a very hard pinch it hurt a lotwhich seemed to rule out the possibility that he was having a very bizarre dreambut shh listen someones coming i think i think it might be ushermione had her ear pressed against the cupboard doorfootsteps across the hall yes i think its us going down to hagridsare you telling me harry whispered that were here in this cupboard and were out there tooyes said hermione her ear still glued to the cupboard door im sure its us it doesnt sound like more than three people and were walking slowly because were under the invisibility cloak she broke off still listening intentlyweve gone down the front stepshermione sat down on an upturned bucket looking desperately anxiousbut harry wanted a few questions answeredwhere did you get that hourglass thingits called a time turner hermione whispered and i got it from professor mcgonagall on our first day back ive been using it all year to get to all my lessons professor mcgonagall made me swear i wouldnt tell anyone she had to write all sorts of letters to the ministry ofmagic so i could have one she had to tell them that i was a model student and that id never ever use it for anything except my studies ive been turning it back so i could do hours over againthats how ive been doing several lessons at once see butharry i dont understand what dumbledore wants us to do why did he tell us to go back three hours hows that going to help siriusharry stared at her shadowy facethere must be something that happened around now he wants us to change he said slowly what happened we were walking down to hagrids three hours agothis is three hours ago and we are walking down to hagrids said hermione we just heard ourselves leavingharry frowned he felt as though he were screwing up his whole brain in concentrationdumbledore just said just said we could save more than one innocent life and then it hit him hermione were going to save buckbeakbut how will that help siriusdumbledore said he just told us where the window is the window of flitwicks office where theyve got sirius locked up weve got to fly buckbeak up to the window and rescue sirius sirius can escape on buckbeak they can escape togetherfrom what harry could see of hermiones face she looked terrifiedif we manage that without being seen itll be a miraclewell weve got to try havent we said harry he stood up and pressed his ear against the door doesnt sound like anyones therecome on lets goharry pushed open the closet door the entrance hall was deserted as quietly and quickly as they could they darted out of the closet anddown the stone steps the shadows were already lengthening the tops of the trees in the forbidden forest gilded once more with goldif anyones looking out of the window hermione squeaked looking up at the castle behind themwell run for it said harry determinedly straight into the forestall right well have to hide behind a tree or something and keep a lookout okay but well go around by the greenhouses said hermione breathlessly we need to keep out of sight of hagrids front door or well see us we must be nearly at hagrids by nowstill working out what she meant harry set off at a sprint hermione behind him they tore across the vegetable gardens to the greenhousespaused for a moment behind them then set off again fast as they couldskirting around the whomping willow tearing toward the shelter of the forestsafe in the shadows of the trees harry turned around seconds laterhermione arrived beside him pantingright she gasped we need to sneak over to hagrids keep out of sight harrythey made their way silently through the trees keeping to the very edge of the forest then as they glimpsed the front of hagrids house they heard a knock upon his door they moved quickly behind a wide oak trunk and peered out from either side hagrid had appeared in his doorwayshaking and white looking around to see who had knocked and harry heard his own voiceits us were wearing the invisibility cloak let us in and we can take it offyeh shouldnve come hagrid whispered he stood back then shut the door quicklythis is the weirdest thing weve ever done harry said ferventlylets move along a bit hermione whispered we need to get nearer to buckbeakthey crept through the trees until they saw the nervous hippogrifftethered to the fence around hagrids pumpkin patchnow harry whisperedno said hermione if we steal him now those committee people will think hagrid set him free weve got to wait until theyve seen hes tied outsidethats going to give us about sixty seconds said harry this was starting to seem impossibleat that moment there was a crash of breaking china from inside hagrids cabinthats hagrid breaking the milk jug hermione whispered im going to find scabbers in a moment sure enough a few minutes later they heard hermiones shriek of surprisehermione said

rongo quick don listenthere was a knock on hagrids front door the execution party had arrived hagrid turned around and headed back into his cabin leaving the back door ajar harry watched the grass flatten in patches all around the cabin and heard three pairs of feet retreating he ron and hermione had gone but the harry and hermione hidden in the treescould now hear what was happening inside the cabin through the back doorwhere is the beast came the cold voice of macnairout outside hagrid croakedharry pulled his head out of sight as macnairs face appeared at hagrids window staring out at

into the pumpkin patch and approached buckbeakit is the decision of the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures that the hippogriff buckbeak hereafter called the condemnedshall he executed on the sixth of june at sundown careful not to blink harry stared up into buckbeaks fierce orange eyes once more and bowed buckbeak sank to his scaly knees and then stood up again harry began to fumble with the knot of rope tying buckbeak to the fencesentenced to execution by beheading to be carried out by the committees appointed executioner walden macnaicome on buckbeak harry murmured come on were going to help youquietly quietlyas witnessed below hagrid you sign hereharry threw all his weight onto the rope but buckbeak had dug in his front feetwell lets get this over with said the reedy voice of the committee member from inside hagrids cabin hagrid perhaps it will be better if you stay inside no i i wan ter be with him i don wan him ter be alone footsteps echoed from within the cabinbuckbeak move harry hissedharry tugged harder on the rope around buckbeaks neck the hippogriff began to walk rustling its wings irritably they were still ten feet away from the forest in plain view of hagrids back door one momentplease macnair came dumbledores voice you need to sign too the footsteps stopped harry heaved on the rope buckbeak snapped his beak and walked a little fasterhermiones white face was sticking out from behind a treeharry hurry she mouthedharry could still hear dumbledores voice talking from within the cabinhe gave the rope another wrench buckbeak broke into a grudging trotthey had reached the treesquick quick hermione moaned darting out from behind her treeseizing the rope too and adding her weight to make buckbeak move fasterharry looked over his shoulder they were now blocked from sight they couldnt see hagrids garden at allstop he whispered to hermione they might hear us hagrids back door had opened with a bang harry hermione and buckbeak stood quite still even the hippogriff seemed to be listening intentlysilence then where is it said the reedy voice of the committee member where is the beastit was tied here said the executioner furiously i saw it just herehow extraordinary said dumbledore there was a note of amusement in his voicebeaky said hagrid huskilythere was a swishing noise and the thud of an axe the executioner seemed to have swung it into the fence in anger and then came the howling and this time they could hear hagrids words through his sobsgone gone bless his little beak hes gone musta pulled himself free beaky yeh clever boybuckbeak started to strain against the rope trying to get back to hagrid harry and hermione tightened their grip and dug their heels into the forest floor to stop himsomeone untied him the executioner was snarling we should search the grounds the forestmacnair if buckbeak has indeed been stolen do you really think the thief will have led him away on foot said dumbledore still sounding amused search the skies if you will hagrid i could do with a cup of tea or a large brandyo o course professor said hagrid who sounded weak with happiness come in come inharry and hermione listened closely they heard footsteps the soft cursing of the executioner the snap of the door and then silence once morenow what whispered harry looking aroundwell have to hide in here said hermione who looked very shaken we need to wait until theyve gone back to the castle then we wait until its safe to fly buckbeak up to siriuss window he wont be there foranother couple of hours oh this is going to be difficultshe looked nervously over her shoulder into the depths of the forestthe sun was setting nowwere going to have to move said harry thinking hard weve got to be able to see the whomping willow or we wont know whats going onokay said hermione getting a firmer grip on buckbeaks rope but weve got to keep out of sight harry rememberthey moved around the edge of the forest darkness falling thickly around them until they were hidden behind a clump of trees through which they could make out the willowtheres ron said harry suddenlya dark figure was sprinting across the lawn and its shout echoed through the still night airget away from him get away scabbers come here and then they saw two more figures materialize out of nowhere harry watched himself and hermione chasing after ron then he saw ron divegotcha get off you stinking cat theres sirius said harry the great shape of the dog had bounded out from the roots of the willow they saw him bowl harry over then seize ronlooks even worse from here doesnt it said harry watching the dog pulling ron into the roots ouch look i just got walloped by the tree and so did you this is weird the whomping willow was creaking and lashing out with its lower branches they could see themselves darting here and there trying to reach the trunk and then the tree frozethat was crookshanks pressing the knot said hermioneand there we go harry muttered were inthe moment they disappeared the tree began to move again seconds later they heard footsteps quite close by dumbledore macnair fudgeand the old committee member were making their way up to the castleright after wed gone down into the passage said hermione if only dumbledore had come with usmacnair and fudge wouldve come too said harry bitterly i bet you anything fudge wouldve told macnair to murder sirius on the spotthey watched the four men climb the castle steps and disappear from view for a few minutes the scene was deserted then here comes lupin said harry as they saw another figure sprinting down the stone steps and hating toward the willow harry looked up at the sky clouds were obscuring the moon completelythey watched lupin seize a broken branch from the ground and prod the knot on the trunk the tree stopped fighting and lupin toodisappeared into the gap in its rootsif hed only grabbed the cloak said harry its just lying therehe turned to hermioneif i just dashed out now and grabbed it snaped never be able to get it and harry we mustnt be seenhow can you stand this he asked hermione fiercely just standing here and watching it happen he hesitated im going to grab the cloakharry nohermione seized the back of harrys robes not a moment too soon just then they heard a burst of song it was hagrid making his way up to the castle singing at the top of his voice and weaving slightly as he walked a large bottle was swinging from his handssee hermione whispered see what would have happened weve got to keep out of sight no buckbeakthe hippogriff was making frantic attempts to get to hagrid again harry seized his rope too straining to hold buckbeak back they watched hagrid meander tipsily up to the castle he was gone buckbeak stopped fighting to get away his head drooped sadlybarely two minutes later the castle doors flew open yet again and snape came charging out of them running toward the willowharrys fists clenched as they watched snape skid to a halt next to the tree looking around he grabbed the cloak and held it upget your filthy hands off it harry snarled under his breath shhsnape seized the branch lupin had used to freeze the tree prodded the knot and vanished from view as he put on the cloakso thats it said hermione quietly were all down there and now weve just got to wait until we come back up againshe took the end of buckbeaks rope and tied it securely around the nearest tree then sat down on the dry ground arms around her kneesharry theres something i dont understand why didnt the dementors get sirius i remember them coming and then i think i passed out there were so many of themharry sat down too he explained what hed seen how as the nearest dementor had lowered its mouth to harrys a large silver something had come galloping across the lake and forced the dementors to retreathermiones mouth was slightly open by the time harry had finishedbut what was ittheres only one thing it could have been to make the dementors gosaid harry a real patronus a powerful onebut who conjured itharry didnt say anything he was thinking back to the person hed seen on the other bank of the lake he knew who he thought it had been but how could it have beendidnt you see what they looked like said hermione eagerly was it one of the teachersno said harry he wasnt a teacherbut it must have been a really powerful wizard to drive all those dementors away if the patronus was shining so brightly didnt it light him up couldnt you see yeah i saw him said harry slowly but maybe i imagined it i wasnt thinking straight i passed out right afterwardwho did you think it wasi think harry swallowed knowing how strange this was going to sound i think it was my dadharry glanced up at hermione and saw that her mouth was fully open nowshe was gazing at him with a mixture of alarm and pityharry your dads well dead she said quietlyi know that said harry quicklyyou think you saw his ghosti dont know no he looked solidbut then maybe i was seeing things said harry but from what i could see it looked like him ive got photos of himhermione was still looking at him as though worried about his sanityi know it sounds crazy said harry flatly he turned to took at buckbeak who was digging his beak into the ground apparently searching for worms but he wasnt really watching buckbeakhe was thinking about his father and about his fathers three oldest friends moony wormtail padfoot and prongs had all four of them been out on the grounds tonight wormtail had reappeared this evening when everyone had thought he was dead was it so impossible his father had done the same had he been seeing things across the take the figure had been too far away to see distinctly yet he had felt surefor a moment before hed lost consciousnessthe leaves overhead rustled faintly in the breeze the moon drifted in and out of sight behind the shifting clouds hermione sat with her face turned toward the willow waiting
