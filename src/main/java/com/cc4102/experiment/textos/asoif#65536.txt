a game of thrones book one of a song of ice and fire by george r r martin prologue we should start back gared urged as the woods began to grow dark around them the wildlings are dead do the dead frighten you ser waymar royce asked with just the hint of a smile gared did not rise to the bait he was an old man past fifty and he had seen the lordlings come and go dead is dead he said we have no business with the dead are they dead royce asked softly what proof have we will saw them gared said if he says they are dead thats proof enough for me will had known they would drag him into the quarrel sooner or later he wished it had been later rather than sooner my mother told me that dead men sing no songs he put in my wet nurse said the same thing will royce replied never believe anything you hear at a womans tit there are things to be learned even from the dead his voice echoed too loud in the twilit forest page we have a long ride before us gared pointed out eight days maybe nine and night is falling ser waymar royce glanced at the sky with disinterest it does that every day about this time are you unmanned by the dark gared will could see the tightness around gareds mouth the barely sup pressed anger in his eyes under the thick black hood of his cloak gared had spent forty years in the nights watch man and boy and he was not accustomed to being made light of yet it was more than that under the wounded pride will could sense something else in the older man you could taste it a nervous tension that came perilous close to fear will shared his unease he had been four years on the wall the first time he had been sent beyond all the old stories had come rushing back and his bowels had turned to water he had laughed about it afterward he was a veteran of a hundred rangings by now and the endless dark wilderness that the southron called the haunted forest had no more terrors for him until tonight something was different tonight there was an edge to this darkness that made his hackles rise nine days they had been riding north and northwest and then north again farther and farther from the wall hard on the track of a band of wildling raiders each day had been worse than the day that had come before it today was the worst of all a cold wind was blowing out of the north and it made the trees rustle like living things all day will had felt as though something were watching him something cold and implacable that loved him not gared had felt it too will wanted nothing so much as to ride hellbent for the safety of the wall but that was not a feeling to share with your commander especially not a commander like this one ser waymar royce was the youngest son of an ancient house with too many heirs he was a handsome youth of eighteen greyeyed and graceful and slender as a knife mounted on his huge black destrier the knight towered above will and gared on their smaller garrons he wore black leather boots black woolen pants black moleskin gloves and a fine supple coat of gleaming black ringmail over layers of black wool and boiled leather ser waymar had been a sworn brother of the nights watch for less than half a year but no one could say he had not prepared for his vocation at least insofar as his wardrobe was concerned his cloak was his crowning glory sable thick and black and soft as sin bet he killed them all himself he did gared told the barracks over wine twisted their little heads off our mighty warrior they had all shared the laugh it is hard to take orders from a man you laughed at in your cups will reflected as he sat shivering atop his garron gared must have felt the same mormont said as we should track them and we did gared said theyre dead they shant trouble us no more theres hard riding before us i dont like this weather if it snows we could be a fortnight getting back and snows the best we can hope for ever seen an ice storm my lord the lordling seemed not to hear him he studied the deepening twilight in that halfbored halfdistracted page way he had will had ridden with the knight long enough to understand that it was best not to interrupt him when he looked like that tell me again what you saw will all the details leave nothing out will had been a hunter before he joined the nights watch well a poacher in truth mallister freeriders had caught him redhanded in the mallisters own woods skinning one of the mallisters own bucks and it had been a choice of putting on the black or losing a hand no one could move through the woods as silent as will and it had not taken the black brothers long to discover his talent the camp is two miles farther on over that ridge hard beside a stream will said i got close as i dared theres eight of them men and women both no children i could see they put up a leanto against the rock the snows pretty well covered it now but i could still make it out no fire burning but the firepit was still plain as day no one moving i watched a long time no living man ever lay so still did you see any blood well no will admitted did you see any weapons some swords a few bows one man had an axe heavylooking doublebladed a cruel piece of iron it was on the ground beside him right by his hand did you make note of the position of the bodies will shrugged a couple are sitting up against the rock most of them on the ground fallen like or sleeping royce suggested fallen will insisted theres one woman up an ironwood halfhid in the branches a fareyes he smiled thinly i took care she never saw me when i got closer i saw that she wasnt moving neither despite himself he shivered you have a chill royce asked some will muttered the wind mlord the young knight turned back to his grizzled manatarms frostfallen leaves whispered past them and royces destrier moved restlessly what do you think might have killed these men gared ser waymar asked casually he adjusted the drape of his long sable cloak it was the cold gared said with iron certainty i saw men freeze last winter and the one before when i was half a boy everyone talks about snows forty foot deep and how the ice wind comes howling out of the north but the real enemy is the cold it steals up on you quieter than will and at first you shiver and your teeth chatter and you stamp your feet and dream of mulled wine and nice hot fires it burns it does nothing burns like the cold but only for a while then it gets inside you and starts to fill you up and after a while you dont have the strength to fight it its easier just to sit down or go to sleep they say you dont feel any pain toward the end first you go weak and drowsy and everything starts to fade and then its like sinking into a sea of warm milk peaceful like such eloquence gared ser waymar observed i never suspected you had it in you page ive had the cold in me too lordling gared pulled back his hood giving ser waymar a good long look at the stumps where his ears had been two ears three toes and the little finger off my left hand i got off light we found my brother frozen at his watch with a smile on his face ser waymar shrugged you ought dress more warmly gared gared glared at the lordling the scars around his ear holes flushed red with anger where maester aemon had cut the ears away well see how warm you can dress when the winter comes he pulled up his hood and hunched over his garron silent and sullen if gared said it was the cold will began have you drawn any watches this past week will yes mlord there never was a week when he did not draw a dozen bloody watches what was the man driving at and how did you find the wall weeping will said frowning he saw it clear enough now that the lordling had pointed it out they couldnt have froze not if the wall was weeping it wasnt cold enough royce nodded bright lad weve had a few light frosts this past week and a quick flurry of snow now and then but surely no cold fierce enough to kill eight grown men men clad in fur and leather let me remind you with shelter near at hand and the means of making fire the knights smile was cocksure will lead us there i would see these dead men for myself and then there was nothing to be done for it the order had been given and honor bound them to obey will went in front his shaggy little garron picking the way carefully through the undergrowth a light snow had fallen the night before and there were stones and roots and hidden sinks lying just under its crust waiting for the careless and the unwary ser waymar royce came next his great black destrier snorting impatiently the warhorse was the wrong mount for ranging but try and tell that to the lordling gared brought up the rear the old manatarms muttered to himself as he rode twilight deepened the cloudless sky turned a deep purple the color of an old bruise then faded to black the stars began to come out a halfmoon rose will was grateful for the light we can make a better pace than this surely royce said when the moon was full risen not with this horse will said fear had made him insolent perhaps my lord would care to take the lead ser waymar royce did not deign to reply somewhere off in the wood a wolf howled will pulled his garron over beneath an ancient gnarled ironwood and dismounted page why are you stopping ser waymar asked best go the rest of the way on foot mlord its just over that ridge royce paused a moment staring off into the distance his face reflective a cold wind whispered through the trees his great sable cloak stirred behind like something halfalive theres something wrong here gared muttered the young knight gave him a disdainful smile is there cant you feel it gared asked listen to the darkness will could feel it four years in the nights watch and he had never been so afraid what was it wind trees rustling a wolf which sound is it that unmans you so gared when gared did not answer royce slid gracefully from his saddle he tied the destrier securely to a lowhanging limb well away from the other horses and drew his longsword from its sheath jewels glittered in its hilt and the moonlight ran down the shining steel it was a splendid weapon castleforged and newmade from the look of it will doubted it had ever been swung in anger the trees press close here will warned that sword will tangle you up mord better a knife if i need instruction i will ask for it the young lord said gared stay here guard the horses gared dismounted we need a fire ill see to it how big a fool are you old man if there are enemies in this wood a fire is the last thing we want theres some enemies a fire will keep away gared said bears and direwolves and and other things ser waymars mouth became a hard line no fire gareds hood shadowed his face but will could see the hard glitter in his eyes as he stared at the knight for a moment he was afraid the older man would go for his sword it was a short ugly thing its grip discolored by sweat its edge nicked from hard use but will would not have given an iron bob for the lordlings life if gared pulled it from its scabbard finally gared looked down no fire he muttered low under his breath royce took it for acquiescence and turned away lead on he said to will will threaded their way through a thicket then started up the slope to the low ridge where he had found his vantage point under a sentinel tree under the thin crust of snow the ground was damp and muddy slick footing with rocks and hidden roots to trip you up will made no sound as he climbed behind him he heard the soft metallic slither of the lordlings ringmail the rustle of leaves and muttered curses as reaching branches grabbed at his longsword and tugged on his splendid sable cloak the great sentinel was right there at the top of the ridge where will had known it would be its lowest branches a bare foot off the ground will slid in underneath flat on his belly in the snow and the mud and page looked down on the empty clearing below his heart stopped in his chest for a moment he dared not breathe moonlight shone down on the clearing the ashes of the firepit the snowcovered leanto the great rock the little halffrozen stream everything was just as it had been a few hours ago they were gone all the bodies were gone gods he heard behind him a sword slashed at a branch as ser waymar royce gained the ridge he stood there beside the sentinel longsword in hand his cloak billowing behind him as the wind came up outlined nobly against the stars for all to see get down will whispered urgently somethings wrong royce did not move he looked down at the empty clearing and laughed your dead men seem to have moved camp will wills voice abandoned him he groped for words that did not come it was not possible his eyes swept back and forth over the abandoned campsite stopped on the axe a huge doublebladed battleaxe still lying where he had seen it last untouched a valuable weapon on your feet will ser waymar commanded theres no one here i wont have you hiding under a bush reluctantly will obeyed ser waymar looked him over with open disapproval i am not going back to castle black a failure on my first ranging we will find these men he glanced around up the tree be quick about it look for a fire will turned away wordless there was no use to argue the wind was moving it cut right through him he went to the tree a vaulting greygreen sentinel and began to climb soon his hands were sticky with sap and he was lost among the needles fear filled his gut like a meal he could not digest he whispered a prayer to the nameless gods of the wood and slipped his dirk free of its sheath he put it between his teeth to keep both hands free for climbing the taste of cold iron in his mouth gave him comfort down below the lordling called out suddenly who goes there will heard uncertainty in the challenge he stopped climbing he listened he watched the woods gave answer the rustle of leaves the icy rush of the stream a distant hoot of a snow owl the others made no sound will saw movement from the corner of his eye pale shapes gliding through the wood he turned his head glimpsed a white shadow in the darkness then it was gone branches stirred gently in the wind scratching at one another with wooden fingers will opened his mouth to call down a warning and the words seemed to freeze in his throat perhaps he was wrong perhaps it had only been a bird a reflection on the snow some trick of the moonlight what had he seen after all will where are you ser waymar called up can you see anything he was turning in a slow circle suddenly wary his sword in hand he must have felt them as will felt them there was nothing to see page answer me why is it so cold it was cold shivering will clung more tightly to his perch his face pressed hard against the trunk of the sentinel he could feel the sweet sticky sap on his cheek a shadow emerged from the dark of the wood it stood in front of royce tall it was and gaunt and hard as old bones with flesh pale as milk its armor seemed to change color as it moved here it was white as newfallen snow there black as shadow everywhere dappled with the deep greygreen of the trees the patterns ran like moonlight on water with every step it took will heard the breath go out of ser waymar royce in a long hiss come no farther the lordling warned his voice cracked like a boys he threw the long sable cloak back over his shoulders to free his arms for battle and took his sword in both hands the wind had stopped it was very cold the other slid forward on silent feet in its hand was a longsword like none that will had ever seen no human metal had gone into the forging of that blade it was alive with moonlight translucent a shard of crystal so thin that it seemed almost to vanish when seen edgeon there was a faint blue shimmer to the thing a ghostlight that played around its edges and somehow will knew it was sharper than any razor ser waymar met him bravely dance with me then he lifted his sword high over his head defiant his hands trembled from the weight of it or perhaps from the cold yet in that moment will thought he was a boy no longer but a man of the nights watch the other halted will saw its eyes blue deeper and bluer than any human eyes a blue that burned like ice they fixed on the longsword trembling on high watched the moonlight running cold along the metal for a heartbeat he dared to hope they emerged silently from the shadows twins to the first three of them four five ser waymar may have felt the cold that came with them but he never saw them never heard them will had to call out it was his duty and his death if he did he shivered and hugged the tree and kept the silence the pale sword came shivering through the air ser waymar met it with steel when the blades met there was no ring of metal on metal only a high thin sound at the edge of hearing like an animal screaming in pain royce checked a second blow and a third then fell back a step another flurry of blows and he fell back again behind him to right to left all around him the watchers stood patient faceless silent the shifting patterns of their delicate armor making them all but invisible in the wood yet they made no move to interfere again and again the swords met until will wanted to cover his ears against the strange anguished keening of their clash ser waymar was panting from the effort now his breath steaming in the moonlight his blade was white with frost the others danced with pale blue light then royces parry came a beat too late the pale sword bit through the ringmail beneath his arm the young lord cried out in pain blood welled between the rings it steamed in the cold and the droplets seemed red as fire where they touched the snow ser page waymars fingers brushed his side his moleskin glove came away soaked with red the other said something in a language that will did not know his voice was like the cracking of ice on a winter lake and the words were mocking ser waymar royce found his fury for robert he shouted and he came up snarling lifting the frostcovered longsword with both hands and swinging it around in a flat sidearm slash with all his weight behind it the others parry was almost lazy when the blades touched the steel shattered a scream echoed through the forest night and the longsword shivered into a hundred brittle pieces the shards scattering like a rain of needles royce went to his knees shrieking and covered his eyes blood welled between his fingers the watchers moved forward together as if some signal had been given swords rose and fell all in a deathly silence it was cold butchery the pale blades sliced through ringmail as if it were silk will closed his eyes far beneath him he heard their voices and laughter sharp as icicles when he found the courage to look again a long time had passed and the ridge below was empty he stayed in the tree scarce daring to breathe while the moon crept slowly across the black sky finally his muscles cramping and his fingers numb with cold he climbed down royces body lay facedown in the snow one arm outflung the thick sable cloak had been slashed in a dozen places lying dead like that you saw how young he was a boy he found what was left of the sword a few feet away the end splintered and twisted like a tree struck by lightning will knelt looked around warily and snatched it up the broken sword would be his proof gared would know what to make of it and if not him then surely that old bear mormont or maester aemon would gared still be waiting with the horses he had to hurry will rose ser waymar royce stood over him his fine clothes were a tatter his face a ruin a shard from his sword transfixed the blind white pupil of his left eye the right eye was open the pupil burned blue it saw the broken sword fell from nerveless fingers will closed his eyes to pray long elegant hands brushed his cheek then tightened around his throat they were gloved in the finest moleskin and sticky with blood yet the touch was icy cold bran the morning had dawned clear and cold with a crispness that hinted at the end of summer they set forth at daybreak to see a man beheaded twenty in all and bran rode among them nervous with excitement this was the first time he had been deemed old enough to go with his lord father and his page brothers to see the kings justice done it was the ninth year of summer and the seventh of brans life the man had been taken outside a small holdfast in the hills robb thought he was a wildling his sword sworn to mance rayder the kingbeyondthewall it made brans skin prickle to think of it he remembered the hearth tales old nan told them the wildlings were cruel men she said slavers and slayers and thieves they consorted with giants and ghouls stole girl children in the dead of night and drank blood from polished horns and their women lay with the others in the long night to sire terrible halfhuman children but the man they found bound hand and foot to the holdfast wall awaiting the kings justice was old and scrawny not much taller than robb he had lost both ears and a finger to frostbite and he dressed all in black the same as a brother of the nights watch except that his furs were ragged and greasy the breath of man and horse mingled steaming in the cold morning air as his lord father had the man cut down from the wall and dragged before them robb and jon sat tall and still on their horses with bran between them on his pony trying to seem older than seven trying to pretend that hed seen all this before a faint wind blew through the holdfast gate over their heads flapped the banner of the starks of winterfell a grey direwolf racing across an icewhite field brans father sat solemnly on his horse long brown hair stirring in the wind his closely trimmed beard was shot with white making him look older than his thirtyfive years he had a grim cast to his grey eyes this day and he seemed not at all the man who would sit before the fire in the evening and talk softly of the age of heroes and the children of the forest he had taken off fathers face bran thought and donned the face of lord stark of winterfell there were questions asked and answers given there in the chill of morning but afterward bran could not recall much of what had been said finally his lord father gave a command and two of his guardsmen dragged the ragged man to the ironwood stump in the center of the square they forced his head down onto the hard black wood lord eddard stark dismounted and his ward theon greyjoy brought forth the sword ice that sword was called it was as wide across as a mans hand and taller even than robb the blade was valyrian steel spellforged and dark as smoke nothing held an edge like valyrian steel his father peeled off his gloves and handed them to jory cassel the captain of his household guard he took hold of ice with both hands and said in the name of robert of the house baratheon the first of his name king of the andals and the rhoynar and the first men lord of the seven kingdoms and protector of the realm by the word of eddard of the house stark lord of winterfell and warden of the north i do sentence you to die he lifted the greatsword high above his head brans bastard brother jon snow moved closer keep the pony well in hand he whispered and dont look away father will know if you do bran kept his pony well in hand and did not look away his father took off the mans head with a single sure stroke blood sprayed out across the snow as red as surnmerwine one of the horses reared and had to be restrained to keep from bolting bran could not take his eyes off the blood the snows around the stump drank it eagerly reddening as he watched the head bounced off a thick root and rolled it came up near greyjoys feet theon was a lean dark page youth of nineteen who found everything amusing he laughed put his boot on the head and kicked it away ass jon muttered low enough so greyjoy did not hear he put a hand on brans shoulder and bran looked over at his bastard brother you did well jon told him solemnly jon was fourteen an old hand at justice it seemed colder on the long ride back to winterfell though the wind had died by then and the sun was higher in the sky bran rode with his brothers well ahead of the main party his pony struggling hard to keep up with their horses the deserter died bravely robb said he was big and broad and growing every day with his mothers coloring the fair skin redbrown hair and blue eyes of the tullys of riverrun he had courage at the least no jon snow said quietly it was not courage this one was dead of fear you could see it in his eyes stark jons eyes were a grey so dark they seemed almost black but there was little they did not see he was of an age with robb but they did not look alike jon was slender where robb was muscular dark where robb was fair graceful and quick where his half brother was strong and fast robb was not impressed the others take his eyes he swore he died well race you to the bridge done jon said kicking his horse forward robb cursed and followed and they galloped off down the trail robb laughing and hooting jon silent and intent the hooves of their horses kicked up showers of snow as they went bran did not try to follow his pony could not keep up he had seen the ragged mans eyes and he was thinking of them now after a while the sound of robbs laughter receded and the woods grew silent again so deep in thought was he that he never heard the rest of the party until his father moved up to ride beside him are you well bran he asked not unkindly yes father bran told him he looked up wrapped in his furs and leathers mounted on his great warhorse his lord father loomed over him like a giant robb says the man died bravely but jon says he was afraid what do you think his father asked bran thought about it can a man still be brave if hes afraid that is the only time a man can be brave his father told him do you understand why i did it he was a wildling bran said they carry off women and sell them to the others his lord father smiled old nan has been telling you stories again in truth the man was an oathbreaker a deserter from the nights watch no man is more dangerous the deserter knows his life is forfeit if he is taken so he will not flinch from any crime no matter how vile but you mistake me the question was not why the man had to die but why i must do it page bran had no answer for that king robert has a headsman he said uncertainly he does his father admitted as did the targaryen kings before him yet our way is the older way the blood of the first men still flows in the veins of the starks and we hold to the belief that the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword if you would take a mans life you owe it to him to look into his eyes and hear his final words and if you cannot bear to do that then perhaps the man does not deserve to die one day bran you will be robbs bannerman holding a keep of your own for your brother and your king and justice will fall to you when that day comes you must take no pleasure in the task but neither must you look away a ruler who hides behind paid executioners soon forgets what death is that was when jon reappeared on the crest of the hill before them he waved and shouted down at them father bran come quickly see what robb has found then he was gone again jory rode up beside them trouble my lord beyond a doubt his lord father said come let us see what mischief my sons have rooted out now he sent his horse into a trot jory and bran and the rest came after they found robb on the riverbank north of the bridge with jon still mounted beside him the late summer snows had been heavy this moonturn robb stood kneedeep in white his hood pulled back so the sun shone in his hair he was cradling something in his arm while the boys talked in hushed excited voices the riders picked their way carefully through the drifts groping for solid footing on the hidden uneven ground jory cassel and theon greyjoy were the first to reach the boys greyjoy was laughing and joking as he rode bran heard the breath go out of him gods he exclaimed struggling to keep control of his horse as he reached for his sword jorys sword was already out robb get away from it he called as his horse reared under him robb grinned and looked up from the bundle in his arms she cant hurt you he said shes dead jory bran was afire with curiosity by then he would have spurred the pony faster but his father made them dismount beside the bridge and approach on foot bran jumped off and ran by then jon jory and theon greyjoy had all dismounted as well what in the seven hells is it greyjoy was saying a wolf robb told him a freak greyjoy said look at the size of it brans heart was thumping in his chest as he pushed through a waisthigh drift to his brothers side halfburied in bloodstained snow a huge dark shape slumped in death ice had formed in its shaggy grey fur and the faint smell of corruption clung to it like a womans perfume bran glimpsed blind eyes crawling with maggots a wide mouth full of yellowed teeth but it was the size of it that made him gasp it was bigger than his pony twice the size of the largest hound in his fathers kennel page its no freak jon said calmly thats a direwolf they grow larger than the other kind theon greyjoy said theres not been a direwolf sighted south of the wall in two hundred years i see one now jon replied bran tore his eyes away from the monster that was when he noticed the bundle in robbs arms he gave a cry of delight and moved closer the pup was a tiny ball of greyblack fur its eyes still closed it nuzzled blindly against robbs chest as he cradled it searching for milk among his leathers making a sad little whimpery sound bran reached out hesitantly go on robb told him you can touch him bran gave the pup a quick nervous stroke then turned as jon said here you go his half brother put a second pup into his arms there are five of them bran sat down in the snow and hugged the wolf pup to his face its fur was soft and warm against his cheek direwolves loose in the realm after so many years muttered hullen the master of horse i like it not it is a sign jory said father frowned this is only a dead animal jory he said yet he seemed troubled snow crunched under his boots as he moved around the body do we know what killed her theres something in the throat robb told him proud to have found the answer before his father even asked there just under the jaw his father knelt and groped under the beasts head with his hand he gave a yank and held it up for all to see a foot of shattered antler tines snapped off all wet with blood a sudden silence descended over the party the men looked at the antler uneasily and no one dared to speak even bran could sense their fear though he did not understand his father tossed the antler to the side and cleansed his hands in the snow im surprised she lived long enough to whelp he said his voice broke the spell maybe she didnt jory said ive heard tales maybe the bitch was already dead when the pups came born with the dead another man put in worse luck no matter said hullen they be dead soon enough too bran gave a wordless cry of dismay the sooner the better theon greyjoy agreed he drew his sword give the beast here bran the little thing squirmed against him as if it heard and understood no bran cried out fiercely its mine page put away your sword greyjoy robb said for a moment he sounded as commanding as their father like the lord he would someday be we will keep these pups you cannot do that boy said harwin who was hullens son it be a mercy to kill them hullen said bran looked to his lord father for rescue but got only a frown a furrowed brow hullen speaks truly son better a swift death than a hard one from cold and starvation no he could feel tears welling in his eyes and he looked away he did not want to cry in front of his father robb resisted stubbornly ser rodriks red bitch whelped again last week he said it was a small litter only two live pups shell have milk enough shell rip them apart when they try to nurse lord stark jon said it was strange to hear him call father that so formal bran looked at him with desperate hope there are five pups he told father three male two female what of it jon you have five trueborn children jon said three sons two daughters the direwolf is the sigil of your house your children were meant to have these pups my lord bran saw his fathers face change saw the other men exchange glances he loved jon with all his heart at that moment even at seven bran understood what his brother had done the count had come right only because jon had omitted himself he had included the girls included even rickon the baby but not the bastard who bore the surname snow the name that custom decreed be given to all those in the north unlucky enough to be born with no name of their own their father understood as well you want no pup for yourself jon he asked softly the direwolf graces the banners of house stark jon pointed out i am no stark father their lord father regarded jon thoughtfully robb rushed into the silence he left i will nurse him myself father he promised i will soak a towel with warm milk and give him suck from that me too bran echoed the lord weighed his sons long and carefully with his eyes easy to say and harder to do i will not have you wasting the servants time with this if you want these pups you will feed them yourselves is that understood bran nodded eagerly the pup squirmed in his grasp licked at his face with a warm tongue you must train them as well their father said you must train them the kennelmaster will have nothing to do with these monsters i promise you that and the gods help you if you neglect them or brutalize them or train them badly these are not dogs to beg for treats and slink off at a kick a direwolf will rip page a mans arm off his shoulder as easily as a dog will kill a rat are you sure you want this yes father bran said yes robb agreed the pups may die anyway despite all you do they wont die robb said we wont let them die keep them then jory desmond gather up the other pups its time we were back to winterfell it was not until they were mounted and on their way that bran allowed himself to taste the sweet air of victory by then his pup was snuggled inside his leathers warm against him safe for the long ride home bran was wondering what to name him halfway across the bridge jon pulled up suddenly what is it jon their lord father asked cant you hear it bran could hear the wind in the trees the clatter of their hooves on the ironwood planks the whimpering of his hungry pup but jon was listening to something else there jon said he swung his horse around and galloped back across the bridge they watched him dismount where the direwolf lay dead in the snow watched him kneel a moment later he was riding back to them smiling he must have crawled away from the others jon said or been driven away their father said looking at the sixth pup his fur was white where the rest of the litter was grey his eyes were as red as the blood of the ragged man who had died that morning bran thought it curious that this pup alone would have opened his eyes while the others were still blind an albino theon greyjoy said with wry amusement this one will die even faster than the others jon snow gave his fathers ward a long chilling look i think not greyjoy he said this one belongs to me catelyn catelyn had never liked this godswood she had been born a tully at riverrun far to the south on the red fork of the trident the godswood there was a garden bright and airy where tall redwoods spread dappled shadows across tinkling streams birds sang from hidden nests and the air was spicy with the scent of flowers page the gods of winterfell kept a different sort of wood it was a dark primal place three acres of old forest untouched for ten thousand years as the gloomy castle rose around it it smelled of moist earth and decay no redwoods grew here this was a wood of stubborn sentinel trees armored in greygreen needles of mighty oaks of ironwoods as old as the realm itself here thick black trunks crowded close together while twisted branches wove a dense canopy overhead and misshappen roots wrestled beneath the soil this was a place of deep silence and brooding shadows and the gods who lived here had no names but she knew she would find her husband here tonight whenever he took a mans life afterward he would seek the quiet of the godswood catelyn had been anointed with the seven oils and named in the rainbow of light that filled the sept of riverrun she was of the faith like her father and grandfather and his father before him her gods had names and their faces were as familiar as the faces of her parents worship was a septon with a censer the smell of incense a sevensided crystal alive with light voices raised in song the tullys kept a godswood as all the great houses did but it was only a place to walk or read or lie in the sun worship was for the sept for her sake ned had built a small sept where she might sing to the seven faces of god but the blood of the first men still flowed in the veins of the starks and his own gods were the old ones the nameless faceless gods of the greenwood they shared with the vanished children of the forest at the center of the grove an ancient weirwood brooded over a small pool where the waters were black and cold the heart tree ned called it the weirwoods bark was white as bone its leaves dark red like a thousand bloodstained hands a face had been carved in the trunk of the great tree its features long and melancholy the deepcut eyes red with dried sap and strangely watchful they were old those eyes older than winterfell itself they had seen brandon the builder set the first stone if the tales were true they had watched the castles granite walls rise around them it was said that the children of the forest had carved the faces in the trees during the dawn centuries before the coming of the first men across the narrow sea in the south the last weirwoods had been cut down or burned out a thousand years ago except on the isle of faces where the green men kept their silent watch up here it was different here every castle had its godswood and every godswood had its heart tree and every heart tree its face catelyn found her husband beneath the weirwood seated on a mosscovered stone the greatsword ice was across his lap and he was cleaning the blade in those waters black as night a thousand years of humus lay thick upon the godswood floor swallowing the sound of her feet but the red eyes of the weirwood seemed to follow her as she came ned she called softly he lifted his head to look at her catelyn he said his voice was distant and formal where are the children he would always ask her that in the kitchen arguing about names for the wolf pups she spread her cloak on the forest floor and sat beside the pool her back to the weirwood she could feel the eyes watching her but she did her best to ignore them arya is already in love and sansa is charmed and gracious but rickon is not quite sure is he afraid ned asked page a little she admitted he is only three ned frowned he must learn to face his fears he will not be three forever and winter is coming yes catelyn agreed the words gave her a chill as they always did the stark words every noble house had its words family mottoes touchstones prayers of sorts they boasted of honor and glory promised loyalty and truth swore faith and courage all but the starks winter is coming said the stark words not for the first time she reflected on what a strange people these northerners were the man died well ill give him that ned said he had a swatch of oiled leather in one hand he ran it lightly up the greatsword as he spoke polishing the metal to a dark glow i was glad for brans sake you would have been proud of bran i am always proud of bran catelyn replied watching the sword as he stroked it she could see the rippling deep within the steel where the metal had been folded back on itself a hundred times in the forging catelyn had no love for swords but she could not deny that ice had its own beauty it had been forged in valyria before the doom had come to the old freehold when the ironsmiths had worked their metal with spells as well as hammers four hundred years old it was and as sharp as the day it was forged the name it bore was older still a legacy from the age of heroes when the starks were kings in the north he was the fourth this year ned said grimly the poor man was halfmad something had put a fear in him so deep that my words could not reach him he sighed ben writes that the strength of the nights watch is down below a thousand its not only desertions they are losing men on rangings as well is it the wildlings she asked who else ned lifted ice looked down the cool steel length of it and it will only grow worse the day may come when i will have no choice but to call the banners and ride north to deal with this kingbeyondthewall for good and all beyond the wall the thought made catelyn shudder ned saw the dread on her face mance rayder is nothing for us to fear there are darker things beyond the wall she glanced behind her at the heart tree the pale bark and red eyes watching listening thinking its long slow thoughts his smile was gentle you listen to too many of old nans stories the others are as dead as the children of the forest gone eight thousand years maester luwin will tell you they never lived at all no living man has ever seen one until this morning no living man had ever seen a direwolf either catelyn reminded him i ought to know better than to argue with a tully he said with a rueful smile he slid ice back into its sheath you did not come here to tell me crib tales i know how little you like this place what is it my lady catelyn took her husbands hand there was grievous news today my lord i did not wish to trouble you until you had cleansed yourself there was no way to soften the blow so she told him straight i am page so sorry my love jon arryn is dead his eyes found hers and she could see how hard it took him as she had known it would in his youth ned had fostered at the eyrie and the childless lord arryn had become a second father to him and his fellow ward robert baratheon when the mad king aerys targaryen had demanded their heads the lord of the eyrie had raised his moonandfalcon banners in revolt rather than give up those he had pledged to protect and one day fifteen years ago this second father had become a brother as well as he and ned stood together in the sept at riverrun to wed two sisters the daughters of lord hoster tully jon he said is this news certain it was the kings seal and the letter is in roberts own hand i saved it for you he said lord arryn was taken quickly even maester pycelle was helpless but he brought the milk of the poppy so jon did not linger long in pain that is some small mercy i suppose he said she could see the grief on his face but even then he thought first of her your sister he said and jons boy what word of them the message said only that they were well and had returned to the eyrie catelyn said i wish they had gone to riverrun instead the eyrie is high and lonely and it was ever her husbands place not hers lord jons memory will haunt each stone i know my sister she needs the comfort of family and friends around her your uncle waits in the vale does he not jon named him knight of the gate id heard catelyn nodded brynden will do what he can for her and for the boy that is some comfort but still go to her ned urged take the children fill her halls with noise and shouts and laughter that boy of hers needs other children about him and lysa should not be alone in her grief would that i could catelyn said the letter had other tidings the king is riding to winterfell to seek you out it took ned a moment to comprehend her words but when the understanding came the darkness left his eyes robert is coming here when she nodded a smile broke across his face catelyn wished she could share his joy but she had heard the talk in the yards a direwolf dead in the snow a broken antler in its throat dread coiled within her like a snake but she forced herself to smile at this man she loved this man who put no faith in signs i knew that would please you she said we should send word to your brother on the wall yes of course he agreed ben will want to be here i shall tell maester luwin to send his swiftest bird ned rose and pulled her to her feet damnation how many years has it been and he gives us no more notice than this how many in his party did the message say i should think a hundred knights at the least with all their retainers and half again as many freeriders page cersei and the children travel with them robert will keep an easy pace for their sakes he said it is just as well that will give us more time to prepare the queens brothers are also in the party she told him ned grimaced at that there was small love between him and the queens family catelyn knew the lannisters of casterly rock had come late to roberts cause when victory was all but certain and he had never forgiven them well if the price for roberts company is an infestation of lannisters so be it it sounds as though robert is bringing half his court where the king goes the realm follows she said it will be good to see the children the youngest was still sucking at the lannister womans teat the last time i saw him he must be what five by now prince tornmen is seven she told him the same age as bran please ned guard your tongue the lannister woman is our queen and her pride is said to grow with every passing year ned squeezed her hand there must be a feast of course with singers and robert will want to hunt i shall send jory south with an honor guard to meet them on the kingsroad and escort them back gods how are we going to feed them all on his way already you said damn the man damn his royal hide daenerys her brother held the gown up for her inspection this is beauty touch it go on caress the fabric dany touched it the cloth was so smooth that it seemed to run through her fingers like water she could not remember ever wearing anything so soft it frightened her she pulled her hand away is it really mine a gift from the magister illyrio viserys said smiling her brother was in a high mood tonight the color will bring out the violet in your eyes and you shall have gold as well and jewels of all sorts illyrio has promised tonight you must look like a princess a princess dany thought she had forgotten what that was like perhaps she had never really known why does he give us so much she asked what does he want from us for nigh on half a year they had lived in the magisters house eating his food pampered by his servants dany was thirteen old enough to know that such gifts seldom come without their price here in the free city of pentos illyrio is no fool viserys said he was a gaunt young man with nervous hands and a feverish look in his pale lilac eyes the magister knows that i will not forget my friends when i come into my throne dany said nothing magister illyrio was a dealer in spices gemstones dragonbone and other less savory things he had friends in all of the nine free cities it was said and even beyond in vaes dothrak and the fabled lands beside the jade sea it was also said that hed never had a friend he wouldnt page cheerfully sell for the right price dany listened to the talk in the streets and she heard these things but she knew better than to question her brother when he wove his webs of dream his anger was a terrible thing when roused viserys called it waking the dragon her brother hung the gown beside the door illyrio will send the slaves to bathe you be sure you wash off the stink of the stables khal drogo has a thousand horses tonight he looks for a different sort of mount he studied her critically you still slouch straighten yourself he pushed back her shoulders with his hands let them see that you have a womans shape now his fingers brushed lightly over her budding breasts and tightened on a nipple you will not fail me tonight if you do it will go hard for you you dont want to wake the dragon do you his fingers twisted her the pinch cruelly hard through the rough fabric of her tunic do you he repeated no dany said meekly her brother smiled good he touched her hair almost with affection when they write the history of my reign sweet sister they will say that it began tonight when he was gone dany went to her window and looked out wistfully on the waters of the bay the square brick towers of pentos were black silhouettes outlined against the setting sun dany could hear the singing of the red priests as they lit their night fires and the shouts of ragged children playing games beyond the walls of the estate for a moment she wished she could be out there with them barefoot and breathless and dressed in tatters with no past and no future and no feast to attend at khal drogos manse somewhere beyond the sunset across the narrow sea lay a land of green hills and flowered plains and great rushing rivers where towers of dark stone rose amidst magnificent bluegrey mountains and armored knights rode to battle beneath the banners of their lords the dothraki called that land rhaesh andahli the land of the andals in the free cities they talked of westeros and the sunset kingdoms her brother had a simpler name our land he called it the words were like a prayer with him if he said them enough the gods were sure to hear ours by blood right taken from us by treachery but ours still ours forever you do not steal from the dragon oh no the dragon remembers and perhaps the dragon did remember but dany could not she had never seen this land her brother said was theirs this realm beyond the narrow sea these places he talked of casterly rock and the eyrie highgarden and the vale of arryn dorne and the isle of faces they were just words to her viserys had been a boy of eight when they fled kings landing to escape the advancing armies of the usurper but daenerys had been only a quickening in their mothers womb yet sometimes dany would picture the way it had been so often had her brother told her the stories the midnight flight to dragonstone moonlight shimmering on the ships black sails her brother rhaegar battling the usurper in the bloody waters of the trident and dying for the woman he loved the sack of kings landing by the ones viserys called the usurpers dogs the lords lannister and stark princess elia of dorne pleading for mercy as rhaegars heir was ripped from her breast and murdered before her eyes the polished skulls of the last dragons staring down sightlessly from the walls of the throne room while the kingslayer opened fathers throat with a golden sword she had been born on dragonstone nine moons after their flight while a raging summer storm threatened to rip the island fastness apart they said that storm was terrible the targaryen fleet was smashed while it lay at anchor and huge stone blocks were ripped from the parapets and sent hurtling into the wild waters of the narrow sea her mother had died birthing her and for that her brother viserys had never page forgiven her she did not remember dragonstone either they had run again just before the usurpers brother set sail with his newbuilt fleet by then only dragonstone itself the ancient seat of their house had remained of the seven kingdoms that had once been theirs it would not remain for long the garrison had been prepared to sell them to the usurper but one night ser willem darry and four loyal men had broken into the nursery and stolen them both along with her wet nurse and set sail under cover of darkness for the safety of the braavosian coast she remembered ser willem dimly a great grey bear of a man halfblind roaring and bellowing orders from his sickbed the servants had lived in terror of him but he had always been kind to dany he called her little princess and sometimes my lady and his hands were soft as old leather he never left his bed though and the smell of sickness clung to him day and night a hot moist sickly sweet odor that was when they lived in braavos in the big house with the red door dany had her own room there with a lemon tree outside her window after ser willem had died the servants had stolen what little money they had left and soon after they had been put out of the big house dany had cried when the red door closed behind them forever they had wandered since then from braavos to myr from myr to tyrosh and on to qohor and volantis and lys never staying long in any one place her brother would not allow it the usurpers hired knives were close behind them he insisted though dany had never seen one at first the magisters and archons and merchant princes were pleased to welcome the last targaryens to their homes and tables but as the years passed and the usurper continued to sit upon the iron throne doors closed and their lives grew meaner years past they had been forced to sell their last few treasures and now even the coin they had gotten from mothers crown had gone in the alleys and wine sinks of pentos they called her brother the beggar king dany did not want to know what they called her we will have it all back someday sweet sister he would promise her sometimes his hands shook when he talked about it the jewels and the silks dragonstone and kings landing the iron throne and the seven kingdoms all they have taken from us we will have it back viserys lived for that day all that daenerys wanted back was the big house with the red door the lemon tree outside her window the childhood she had never known there came a soft knock on her door come dany said turning away from the window illyrios servants entered bowed and set about their business they were slaves a gift from one of the magisters many dothraki friends there was no slavery in the free city of pentos nonetheless they were slaves the old woman small and grey as a mouse never said a word but the girl made up for it she was illyrios favorite a fairhaired blueeyed wench of sixteen who chattered constantly as she worked they filled her bath with hot water brought up from the kitchen and scented it with fragrant oils the girl pulled the rough cotton tunic over danys head and helped her into the tub the water was scalding hot but daenerys did not flinch or cry out she liked the heat it made her feel clean besides her brother had often told her that it was never too hot for a targaryen ours is the house of the dragon he would say the fire is in our blood the old woman washed her long silverpale hair and gently combed out the snags all in silence the girl scrubbed her back and her feet and told her how lucky she was drogo is so rich that even his slaves page wear golden collars a hundred thousand men ride in his khalasar and his palace in vaes dothrak has two hundred rooms and doors of solid silver there was more like that so much more what a handsome man the khal was so tall and fierce fearless in battle the best rider ever to mount a horse a demon archer daenerys said nothing she had always assumed that she would wed viserys when she came of age for centuries the targaryens had married brother to sister since aegon the conqueror had taken his sisters to bride the line must be kept pure viserys had told her a thousand times theirs was the kingsblood the golden blood of old valyria the blood of the dragon dragons did not mate with the beasts of the field and targaryens did not mingle their blood with that of lesser men yet now viserys schemed to sell her to a stranger a barbarian when she was clean the slaves helped her from the water and toweled her dry the girl brushed her hair until it shone like molten silver while the old woman anointed her with the spiceflower perfume of the dothraki plains a dab on each wrist behind her ears on the tips of her breasts and one last one cool on her lips down there between her legs they dressed her in the wisps that magister illyrio had sent up and then the gown a deep plum silk to bring out the violet in her eyes the girl slid the gilded sandals onto her feet while the old woman fixed the tiara in her hair and slid golden bracelets crusted with amethysts around her wrists last of all came the collar a heavy golden tore emblazoned with ancient valyrian glyphs now you look all a princess the girl said breathlessly when they were done dany glanced at her image in the silvered looking glass that illyrio had so thoughtfully provided a princess she thought but she remembered what the girl had said how khal drogo was so rich even his slaves wore golden collars she felt a sudden chill and gooseflesh pimpled her bare arms her brother was waiting in the cool of the entry hall seated on the edge of the pool his hand trailing in the water he rose when she appeared and looked her over critically stand there he told her turn around yes good you look regal magister illyrio said stepping through an archway he moved with surprising delicacy for such a massive man beneath loose garments of flamecolored silk rolls of fat jiggled as he walked gemstones glittered on every finger and his man had oiled his forked yellow beard until it shone like real gold may the lord of light shower you with blessings on this most fortunate day princess daenerys the magister said as he took her hand he bowed his head showing a thin glimpse of crooked yellow teeth through the gold of his beard she is a vision your grace a vision he told her brother drogo will be enraptured shes too skinny viserys said his hair the same silverblond as hers had been pulled back tightly behind his head and fastened with a dragonbone brooch it was a severe look that emphasized the hard gaunt lines of his face he rested his hand on the hilt of the sword that illyrio had lent him and said are you sure that khal drogo likes his women this young she has had her blood she is old enough for the khal illyrio told him not for the first time look at her that silvergold hair those purple eyes she is the blood of old valyria no doubt no doubt and highborn daughter of the old king sister to the new she cannot fail to entrance our drogo when he released her hand daenerys found herself trembling page i suppose her brother said doubtfully the savages have queer tastes boys horses sheep best not suggest this to khal drogo illyrio said anger flashed in her brothers lilac eyes do you take me for a fool the magister bowed slightly i take you for a king kings lack the caution of common men my apologies if i have given offense he turned away and clapped his hands for his bearers the streets of pentos were pitchdark when they set out in illyrios elaborately carved palanquin two servants went ahead to light their way carrying ornate oil lanterns with panes of pale blue glass while a dozen strong men hoisted the poles to their shoulders it was warm and close inside behind the curtains dany could smell the stench of illyrios pallid flesh through his heavy perfumes her brother sprawled out on his pillows beside her never noticed his mind was away across the narrow sea we wont need his whole khalasar viserys said his fingers toyed with the hilt of his borrowed blade though dany knew he had never used a sword in earnest ten thousand that would be enough i could sweep the seven kingdoms with ten thousand dothraki screamers the realm will rise for its rightful king tyrell redwyne darry greyjoy they have no more love for the usurper than i do the dornishmen burn to avenge elia and her children and the smallfolk will be with us they cry out for their king he looked at illyrio anxiously they do dont they they are your people and they love you well magister illyrio said amiably in holdfasts all across the realm men lift secret toasts to your health while women sew dragon banners and hide them against the day of your return from across the water he gave a massive shrug or so my agents tell me dany had no agents no way of knowing what anyone was doing or thinking across the narrow sea but she mistrusted illyrios sweet words as she mistrusted everything about illyrio her brother was nodding eagerly however i shall kill the usurper myself he promised who had never killed anyone as he killed my brother rhaegar and lannister too the kingslayer for what he did to my father that would be most fitting magister illyrio said dany saw the smallest hint of a smile playing around his full lips but her brother did not notice nodding he pushed back a curtain and stared off into the night and dany knew he was fighting the battle of the trident once again the ninetowered manse of khal drogo sat beside the waters of the bay its high brick walls overgrown with pale ivy it had been given to the khal by the magisters of pentos illyrio told them the free cities were always generous with the horselords it is not that we fear these barbarians illyrio would explain with a smile the lord of light would hold our city walls against a million dothraki or so the red priests promise yet why take chances when their friendship comes so cheap their palanquin was stopped at the gate the curtains pulled roughly back by one of the house guards he had the copper skin and dark almond eyes of a dothraki but his face was hairless and he wore the spiked bronze cap of the unsullied he looked them over coldly magister illyrio growled something to him in the rough dothraki tongue the guardsman replied in the same voice and waved them through the gates dany noticed that her brothers hand was clenched tightly around the hilt of his borrowed sword he page looked almost as frightened as she felt insolent eunuch viserys muttered as the palanquin lurched up toward the manse magister illyrios words were honey many important men will be at the feast tonight such men have enemies the khal must protect his guests yourself chief among them your grace no doubt the usurper would pay well for your head oh yes viserys said darkly he has tried illyrio i promise you that his hired knives follow us everywhere i am the last dragon and he will not sleep easy while i live the palanquin slowed and stopped the curtains were thrown back and a slave offered a hand to help daenerys out his collar she noted was ordinary bronze her brother followed one hand still clenched hard around his sword hilt it took two strong men to get magister illyrio back on his feet inside the manse the air was heavy with the scent of spices pinchfire and sweet lemon and cinnamon they were escorted across the entry hall where a mosaic of colored glass depicted the doom of valyria oil burned in black iron lanterns all along the walls beneath an arch of twining stone leaves a eunuch sang their coming viserys of the house targaryen the third of his name he called in a high sweet voice king of the andals and the rhoynar and the first men lord of the seven kingdoms and protector of the realm his sister daenerys stormborn princess of dragonstone his honorable host illyrio mopatis magister of the free city of pentos they stepped past the eunuch into a pillared courtyard overgrown in pale ivy moonlight painted the leaves in shades of bone and silver as the guests drifted among them many were dothraki horselords big men with redbrown skin their drooping mustachios bound in metal rings their black hair oiled and braided and hung with bells yet among them moved bravos and sellswords from pentos and myr and tyrosh a red priest even fatter than illyrio hairy men from the port of ibben and lords from the summer isles with skin as black as ebony daenerys looked at them all in wonder and realized with a sudden start of fear that she was the only woman there illyrio whispered to them those three are drogos bloodriders there he said by the pillar is khal moro with his son rhogoro the man with the green beard is brother to the archon of tyrosh and the man behind him is ser jorah mormont the last name caught daenerys a knight no less illyrio smiled through his beard anointed with the seven oils by the high septon himself what is he doing here she blurted the usurper wanted his head illyrio told them some trifling affront he sold some poachers to a tyroshi slaver instead of giving them to the nights watch absurd law a man should be able to do as he likes with his own chattel i shall wish to speak with ser jorah before the night is done her brother said dany found herself looking at the knight curiously he was an older man past forty and balding but still strong and fit instead of silks and cottons he wore wool and leather his tunic was a dark green embroidered with the likeness of a black bear standing on two legs she was still looking at this strange man from the homeland she had never known when magister illyrio page placed a moist hand on her bare shoulder over there sweet princess he whispered there is the khal himself dany wanted to run and hide but her brother was looking at her and if she displeased him she knew she would wake the dragon anxiously she turned and looked at the man viserys hoped would ask to wed her before the night was done the slave girl had not been far wrong she thought khal drogo was a head taller than the tallest man in the room yet somehow light on his feet as graceful as the panther in illyrios menagerie he was younger than shed thought no more than thirty his skin was the color of polished copper his thick mustachios bound with gold and bronze rings i must go and make my submissions magister illyrio said wait here i shall bring him to you her brother took her by the arm as illyrio waddled over to the khal his fingers squeezing so hard that they hurt do you see his braid sweet sister drogos braid was black as midnight and heavy with scented oil hung with tiny bells that rang softly as he moved it swung well past his belt below even his buttocks the end of it brushing against the back of his thighs you see how long it is viserys said when dothraki are defeated in combat they cut off their braids in disgrace so the world will know their shame khal drogo has never lost a fight he is aegon the dragonlord come again and you will be his queen dany looked at khal drogo his face was hard and cruel his eyes as cold and dark as onyx her brother hurt her sometimes when she woke the dragon but he did not frighten her the way this man frightened her i dont want to be his queen she heard herself say in a small thin voice please please viserys i dont want to i want to go home home he kept his voice low but she could hear the fury in his tone how are we to go home sweet sister they took our home from us he drew her into the shadows out of sight his fingers digging into her skin how are we to go home he repeated meaning kings landing and dragonstone and all the realm they had lost dany had only meant their rooms in illyrios estate no true home surely though all they had but her brother did not want to hear that there was no home there for him even the big house with the red door had not been home for him his fingers dug hard into her arm demanding an answer i dont know she said at last her voice breaking tears welled in her eyes i do he said sharply we go home with an army sweet sister with khal drogos army that is how we go home and if you must wed him and bed him for that you will he smiled at her id let his whole khalasar fuck you if need be sweet sister all forty thousand men and their horses too if that was what it took to get my army be grateful it is only drogo in time you may even learn to like him now dry your eyes illyrio is bringing him over and he will not see you crying dany turned and saw that it was true magister illyrio all smiles and bows was escorting khal drogo over to where they stood she brushed away unfallen tears with the back of her hand page smile viserys whispered nervously his hand failing to the hilt of his sword and stand up straight let him see that you have breasts gods know you have little enough as is daenerys smiled and stood up straight eddard the visitors poured through the castle gates in a river of gold and silver and polished steel three hundred strong a pride of bannermen and knights of sworn swords and freeriders over their heads a dozen golden banners whipped back and forth in the northern wind emblazoned with the crowned stag of baratheon ned knew many of the riders there came ser jaime lannister with hair as bright as beaten gold and there sandor clegane with his terrible burned face the tall boy beside him could only be the crown prince and that stunted little man behind them was surely the imp tyrion lannister yet the huge man at the head of the column flanked by two knights in the snowwhite cloaks of the kingsguard seemed almost a stranger to ned until he vaulted off the back of his warhorse with a familiar roar and crushed him in a bonecrunching hug ned ah but it is good to see that frozen face of yours the king looked him over top to bottom and laughed you have not changed at all would that ned had been able to say the same fifteen years past when they had ridden forth to win a throne the lord of storms end had been cleanshaven cleareyed and muscled like a maidens fantasy six and a half feet tall he towered over lesser men and when he donned his armor and the great antlered helmet of his house he became a veritable giant hed had a giants strength too his weapon of choice a spiked iron warhammer that ned could scarcely lift in those days the smell of leather and blood had clung to him like perfume now it was perfume that clung to him like perfume and he had a girth to match his height ned had last seen the king nine years before during balon greyjoys rebellion when the stag and the direwolf had joined to end the pretensions of the selfproclaimed king of the iron islands since the night they had stood side by side in greyjoys fallen stronghold where robert had accepted the rebel lords surrender and ned had taken his son theon as hostage and ward the king had gained at least eight stone a beard as coarse and black as iron wire covered his jaw to hide his double chin and the sag of the royal jowls but nothing could hide his stomach or the dark circles under his eyes yet robert was neds king now and not just a friend so he said only your grace winterfell is yours by then the others were dismounting as well and grooms were coming forward for their mounts roberts queen cersei lannister entered on foot with her younger children the wheelhouse in which they had ridden a huge doubledecked carriage of oiled oak and gilded metal pulled by forty heavy draft horses was too wide to pass through the castle gate ned knelt in the snow to kiss the queens ring while robert embraced catelyn like a longlost sister then the children had been brought forward introduced and approved of by both sides no sooner had those formalities of greeting been completed than the king had said to his host take me down to your crypt eddard i would pay my respects page ned loved him for that for remembering her still after all these years he called for a lantern no other words were needed the queen had begun to protest they had been riding since dawn everyone was tired and cold surely they should refresh themselves first the dead would wait she had said no more than that robert had looked at her and her twin brother jaime had taken her quietly by the arm and she had said no more they went down to the crypt together ned and this king he scarcely recognized the winding stone steps were narrow ned went first with the lantern i was starting to think we would never reach winterfell robert complained as they descended in the south the way they talk about my seven kingdoms a man forgets that your part is as big as the other six combined i trust you enjoyed the journey your grace robert snorted bogs and forests and fields and scarcely a decent inn north of the neck ive never seen such a vast emptiness where are all yourpeople likely they were too shy to come out ned jested he could feel the chill coming up the stairs a cold breath from deep within the earth kings are a rare sight in the north robert snorted more likely they were hiding under the snow snow ned the king put one hand on the wall to steady himself as they descended late summer snows are common enough ned said i hope they did not trouble you they are usually mild the others take your mild snows robert swore what will this place be like in winter i shudder to think the winters are hard ned admitted but the starks will endure we always have you need to come south robert told him you need a taste of summer before it flees in highgarden there are fields of golden roses that stretch away as far as the eye can see the fruits are so ripe they explode in your mouthmelons peaches fireplums youve never tasted such sweetness youll see i brought you some even at storms end with that good wind off the bay the days are so hot you can barely move and you ought to see the towns ned flowers everywhere the markets bursting with food the surnmerwines so cheap and so good that you can get drunk just breathing the air everyone is fat and drunk and rich he laughed and slapped his own ample stomach a thump and the girls ned he exclaimed his eyes sparkling i swear women lose all modesty in the heat they swim naked in the river right beneath the castle even in the streets its too damn hot for wool or fur so they go around in these short gowns silk if they have the silver and cotton if not but its all the same when they start sweating and the cloth sticks to their skin they might as well be naked the king laughed happily robert baratheon had always been a man of huge appetites a man who knew how to take his pleasures that was not a charge anyone could lay at the door of eddard stark yet ned could not help but notice that those pleasures were taking a toll on the king robert was breathing heavily by the time they reached the bottom of the stairs his face red in the lantern light as they stepped out into the darkness of the crypt your grace ned said respectfully he swept the lantern in a wide semicircle shadows moved and page lurched flickering light touched the stones underfoot and brushed against a long procession of granite pillars that marched ahead two by two into the dark between the pillars the dead sat on their stone thrones against the walls backs against the sepulchres that contained their mortal remains she is down at the end with father and brandon he led the way between the pillars and robert followed wordlessly shivering in the subterranean chill it was always cold down here their footsteps rang off the stones and echoed in the vault overhead as they walked among the dead of house stark the lords of winterfell watched them pass their likenesses were carved into the stones that sealed the tombs in long rows they sat blind eyes staring out into eternal darkness while great stone direwolves curled round their feet the shifting shadows made the stone figures seem to stir as the living passed by by ancient custom an iron longsword had been laid across the lap of each who had been lord of winterfell to keep the vengeful spirits in their crypts the oldest had long ago rusted away to nothing leaving only a few red stains where the metal had rested on stone ned wondered if that meant those ghosts were free to roam the castle now he hoped not the first lords of winterfell had been men hard as the land they ruled in the centuries before the dragonlords came over the sea they had sworn allegiance to no man styling themselves the kings in the north ned stopped at last and lifted the oil lantern the crypt continued on into darkness ahead of them but beyond this point the tombs were empty and unsealed black holes waiting for their dead waiting for him and his children ned did not like to think on that here he told his king robert nodded silently knelt and bowed his head there were three tombs side by side lord rickard stark neds father had a long stern face the stonemason had known him well he sat with quiet dignity stone fingers holding tight to the sword across his lap but in life all swords had failed him in two smaller sepulchres on either side were his children brandon had been twenty when he died strangled by order of the mad king aerys targaryen only a few short days before he was to wed catelyn tully of riverrun his father had been forced to watch him die he was the true heir the eldest born to rule lyanna had only been sixteen a childwoman of surpassing loveliness ned had loved her with all his heart robert had loved her even more she was to have been his bride she was more beautiful than that the king said after a silence his eyes lingered on lyannas face as if he could will her back to life finally he rose made awkward by his weight ah damn it ned did you have to bury her in a place like this his voice was hoarse with remembered grief she deserved more than darkness she was a stark of winterfell ned said quietly this is her place she should be on a hill somewhere under a fruit tree with the sun and clouds above her and the rain to wash her clean i was with her when she died ned reminded the king she wanted to come home to rest beside brandon and father he could hear her still at times promise me she had cried in a room that smelled of blood and roses promise me ned the fever had taken her strength and her voice had been faint as a page whisper but when he gave her his word the fear had gone out of his sisters eyes ned remembered the way she had smiled then how tightly her fingers had clutched his as she gave up her hold on life the rose petals spilling from her palm dead and black after that he remembered nothing they had found him still holding her body silent with grief the little crannogman howland reed had taken her hand from his ned could recall none of it i bring her flowers when i can he said lyanna was fond of flowers the king touched her cheek his fingers brushing across the rough stone as gently as if it were living flesh i vowed to kill rhaegar for what he did to her you did ned reminded him only once robert said bitterly they had come together at the ford of the trident while the battle crashed around them robert with his warhammer and his great antlered helm the targaryen prince armored all in black on his breastplate was the threeheaded dragon of his house wrought all in rubies that flashed like fire in the sunlight the waters of the trident ran red around the hooves of their destriers as they circled and clashed again and again until at last a crushing blow from roberts hammer stove in the dragon and the chest beneath it when ned had finally come on the scene rhaegar lay dead in the stream while men of both armies scrabbled in the swirling waters for rubies knocked free of his armor in my dreams i kill him every night robert admitted a thousand deaths will still be less than he deserves there was nothing ned could say to that after a quiet he said we should return your grace your wife will be waiting the others take my wife robert muttered sourly but he started back the way they had come his footsteps falling heavily and if i hear your grace once more ill have your head on a spike we are more to each other than that i had not forgotten ned replied quietly when the king did not answer he said tell me about jon robert shook his head i have never seen a man sicken so quickly we gave a tourney on my sons name day if you had seen jon then you would have sworn he would live forever a fortnight later he was dead the sickness was like a fire in his gut it burned right through him he paused beside a pillar before the tomb of a longdead stark i loved that old man we both did ned paused a moment catelyn fears for her sister how does lysa bear her grief roberts mouth gave a bitter twist not well in truth he admitted i think losing jon has driven the woman mad ned she has taken the boy back to the eyrie against my wishes i had hoped to foster him with tywin lannister at casterly rock jon had no brothers no other sons was i supposed to leave him to be raised by women ned would sooner entrust a child to a pit viper than to lord tywin but he left his doubts unspoken some old wounds never truly heal and bleed again at the slightest word the wife has lost the husband he said carefully perhapsthe mother feared to lose the son the boy is very young six and sickly and lord of the eyrie gods have mercy the king swore lord tywin had never taken a ward before lysa ought to have been honored the lannisters are a great and noble house she page refused to even hear of it then she left in the dead of night without so much as a byyourleave cersei was furious he sighed deeply the boy is my namesake did you know that robert arryn i am sworn to protect him how can i do that if his mother steals him away i will take him as ward if you wish ned said lysa should consent to that she and catelyn were close as girls and she would be welcome here as well a generous offer my friend the king said but too late lord tywin has already given his consent fostering the boy elsewhere would be a grievous affront to him i have more concern for my nephews welfare than i do for lannister pride ned declared that is because you do not sleep with a lannister robert laughed the sound rattling among the tombs and bouncing from the vaulted ceiling his smile was a flash of white teeth in the thicket of the huge black beard ah ned he said you are still too serious he put a massive arm around neds shoulders i had planned to wait a few days to speak to you but i see now theres no need for it come walk with me they started back down between the pillars blind stone eyes seemed to follow them as they passed the king kept his arm around neds shoulder you must have wondered why i finally came north to winterfell after so long ned had his suspicions but he did not give them voice for the joy of my company surely he said lightly and there is the wall you need to see it your grace to walk along its battlements and talk to those who man it the nights watch is a shadow of what it once was benjen says no doubt i will hear what your brother says soon enough robert said the wall has stood for what eight thousand years it can keep a few days more i have more pressing concerns these are difficult times i need good men about me men like jon arryn he served as lord of the eyrie as warden of the east as the hand of the king he will not be easy to replace his son ned began his son will succeed to the eyrie and all its incomes robert said brusquely no more that took ned by surprise he stopped startled and turned to look at his king the words came unbidden the arryns have always been wardens of the east the title goes with the domain perhaps when he comes of age the honor can be restored to him robert said i have this year to think of and next a sixyearold boy is no war leader ned in peace the title is only an honor let the boy keep it for his fathers sake if not his own surely you owe jon that much for his service the king was not pleased he took his arm from around neds shoulders jons service was the duty he owed his liege lord i am not ungrateful ned you of all men ought to know that but the son is not the father a mere boy cannot hold the east then his tone softened enough of this there is a more important office to discuss and i would not argue with you robert grasped ned by the elbow i have need of you ned i am yours to command your grace always they were words he had to say and so he said them page apprehensive about what might come next robert scarcely seemed to hear him those years we spent in the eyrie gods those were good years i want you at my side again ned i want you down in kings landing not up here at the end of the world where you are no damned use to anybody robert looked off into the darkness for a moment as melancholy as a stark i swear to you sitting a throne is a thousand times harder than winning one laws are a tedious business and counting coppers is worse and the people there is no end of them i sit on that damnable iron chair and listen to them complain until my mind is numb and my ass is raw they all want something money or land or justice the lies they tell and my lords and ladies are no better i am surrounded by flatterers and fools it can drive a man to madness ned half of them dont dare tell me the truth and the other half cant find it there are nights i wish we had lost at the trident ah no not truly but i understand ned said softly robert looked at him i think you do if so you are the only one my old friend he smiled lord eddard stark i would name you the hand of the king ned dropped to one knee the offer did not surprise him what other reason could robert have had for coming so far the hand of the king was the secondmost powerful man in the seven kingdoms he spoke with the kings voice commanded the kings armies drafted the kings laws at times he even sat upon the iron throne to dispense kings justice when the king was absent or sick or otherwise indisposed robert was offering him a responsibility as large as the realm itself it was the last thing in the world he wanted your grace he said i am not worthy of the honor robert groaned with goodhumored impatience if i wanted to honor you id let you retire i am planning to make you run the kingdom and fight the wars while i eat and drink and wench myself into an early grave he slapped his gut and grinned you know the saying about the king and his hand ned knew the saying what the king dreams he said the hand builds i bedded a fishmaid once who told me the lowborn have a choicer way to put it the king eats they say and the hand takes the shit he threw back his head and roared his laughter the echoes rang through the darkness and all around them the dead of winterfell seemed to watch with cold and disapproving eyes finally the laughter dwindled and stopped ned was still on one knee his eyes upraised damn it ned the king complained you might at least humor me with a smile they say it grows so cold up here in winter that a mans laughter freezes in his throat and chokes him to death ned said evenly perhaps that is why the starks have so little humor come south with me and ill teach you how to laugh again the king promised you helped me win this damnable throne now help me hold it we were meant to rule together if lyanna had lived we should have been brothers bound by blood as well as affection well it is not too late i have a son you have a daughter my joff and your sansa shall join our houses as page lyanna and i might once have done this offer did surprise him sansa is only eleven robert waved an impatient hand old enough for betrothal the marriage can wait a few years the king smiled now stand up and say yes curse you nothing would give me greater pleasure your grace ned answered he hesitated these honors are all so unexpected may i have some time to consider i need to tell my wife yes yes of course tell catelyn sleep on it if you must the king reached down clasped ned by the hand and pulled him roughly to his feet just dont keep me waiting too long i am not the most patient of men for a moment eddard stark was filled with a terrible sense of foreboding this was his place here in the north he looked at the stone figures all around them breathed deep in the chill silence of the crypt he could feel the eyes of the dead they were all listening he knew and winter was coming jon there were timesnot many but a fewwhen jon snow was glad he was a bastard as he filled his wine cup once more from a passing flagon it struck him that this might be one of them he settled back in his place on the bench among the younger squires and drank the sweet fruity taste of surnmerwine filled his mouth and brought a smile to his lips the great hall of winterfell was hazy with smoke and heavy with the smell of roasted meat and freshbaked bread its grey stone walls were draped with banners white gold crimson the direwolf of stark baratheons crowned stag the lion of lannister a singer was playing the high harp and reciting a ballad but down at this end of the hall his voice could scarcely be heard above the roar of the fire the clangor of pewter plates and cups and the low mutter of a hundred drunken conversations it was the fourth hour of the welcoming feast laid for the king jons brothers and sisters had been seated with the royal children beneath the raised platform where lord and lady stark hosted the king and queen in honor of the occasion his lord father would doubtless permit each child a glass of wine but no more than that down here on the benches there was no one to stop jon drinking as much as he had a thirst for and he was finding that he had a mans thirst to the raucous delight of the youths around him who urged him on every time he drained a glass they were fine company and jon relished the stories they were telling tales of battle and bedding and the hunt he was certain that his companions were more entertaining than the kings offspring he had sated his curiosity about the visitors when they made their entrance the procession had passed not a foot from the place he had been given on the bench and jon had gotten a good long look at them all his lord father had come first escorting the queen she was as beautiful as men said a jeweled tiara gleamed amidst her long golden hair its emeralds a perfect match for the green of her eyes his father helped her up the steps to the dais and led her to her seat but the queen never so much as looked at him even at fourteen jon could see through her smile page next had come king robert himself with lady stark on his arm the king was a great disappointment to jon his father had talked of him often the peerless robert baratheon demon of the trident the fiercest warrior of the realm a giant among princes jon saw only a fat man redfaced under his beard sweating through his silks he walked like a man half in his cups after them came the children little rickon first managing the long walk with all the dignity a threeyearold could muster jon had to urge him on when he stopped to visit close behind came robb in grey wool trimmed with white the stark colors he had the princess myrcella on his arm she was a wisp of a girl not quite eight her hair a cascade of golden curls under a jeweled net jon noticed the shy looks she gave robb as they passed between the tables and the timid way she smiled at him he decided she was insipid robb didnt even have the sense to realize how stupid she was he was grinning like a fool his half sisters escorted the royal princes arya was paired with plump young tommen whose whiteblond hair was longer than hers sansa two years older drew the crown prince joffrey baratheon he was twelve younger than jon or robb but taller than either to jons vast dismay prince joffrey had his sisters hair and his mothers deep green eyes a thick tangle of blond curls dripped down past his golden choker and high velvet collar sansa looked radiant as she walked beside him but jon did not like joffreys pouty lips or the bored disdainful way he looked at winterfells great hall he was more interested in the pair that came behind him the queens brothers the lannisters of casterly rock the lion and the imp there was no mistaking which was which ser jaime lannister was twin to queen cersei tall and golden with flashing green eyes and a smile that cut like a knife he wore crimson silk high black boots a black satin cloak on the breast of his tunic the lion of his house was embroidered in gold thread roaring its defiance they called him the lion of lannister to his face and whispered kingslayer behind his back jon found it hard to look away from him this is what a king should look like he thought to himself as the man passed then he saw the other one waddling along halfhidden by his brothers side tyrion lannister the youngest of lord tywins brood and by far the ugliest all that the gods had given to cersei and jaime they had denied tyrion he was a dwarf half his brothers height struggling to keep pace on stunted legs his head was too large for his body with a brutes squashedin face beneath a swollen shelf of brow one green eye and one black one peered out from under a lank fall of hair so blond it seemed white jon watched him with fascination the last of the high lords to enter were his uncle benjen stark of the nights watch and his fathers ward young theon greyjoy benjen gave jon a warm smile as he went by theon ignored him utterly but there was nothing new in that after all had been seated toasts were made thanks were given and returned and then the feasting began jon had started drinking then and he had not stopped something rubbed against his leg beneath the table jon saw red eyes staring up at him hungry again he asked there was still half a honeyed chicken in the center of the table jon reached out to tear off a leg then had a better idea he knifed the bird whole and let the carcass slide to the floor between his legs ghost ripped into it in savage silence his brothers and sisters had not been permitted to bring their wolves to the banquet but there were more curs than jon could count at this end of the hall and no one page had said a word about his pup he told himself he was fortunate in that too his eyes stung jon rubbed at them savagely cursing the smoke he swallowed another gulp of wine and watched his direwolf devour the chicken dogs moved between the tables trailing after the serving girls one of them a black mongrel bitch with long yellow eyes caught a scent of the chicken she stopped and edged under the bench to get a share jon watched the confrontation the bitch growled low in her throat and moved closer ghost looked up silent and fixed the dog with those hot red eyes the bitch snapped an angry challenge she was three times the size of the direwolf pup ghost did not move he stood over his prize and opened his mouth baring his fangs the bitch tensed barked again then thought better of this fight she turned and slunk away with one last defiant snap to save her pride ghost went back to his meal jon grinned and reached under the table to ruffle the shaggy white fur the direwolf looked up at him nipped gently at his hand then went back to eating is this one of the direwolves ive heard so much of a familiar voice asked close at hand jon looked up happily as his uncle ben put a hand on his head and ruffled his hair much as jon had ruffled the wolf s yes he said his name is ghost one of the squires interrupted the bawdy story hed been telling to make room at the table for their lords brother benjen stark straddled the bench withlong legs and took the wine cup out of jons hand summerwine he said after a taste nothing so sweet how many cups have you had jon jon smiled ben stark laughed as i feared ah well i believe i was younger than you the first time i got truly and sincerely drunk he snagged a roasted onion dripping brown with gravy from a nearby trencher and bit into it it crunched his uncle was sharpfeatured and gaunt as a mountain crag but there was always a hint of laughter in his bluegrey eyes he dressed in black as befitted a man of the nights watch tonight it was rich black velvet with high leather boots and a wide belt with a silver buckle a heavy silver chain was looped round his neck benjen watched ghost with amusement as he ate his onion a very quiet wolf he observed hes not like the others jon said he never makes a sound thats why i named him ghost that and because hes white the others are all dark grey or black there are still direwolves beyond the wall we hear them on our rangings benjen stark gave jon a long look dont you usually eat at table with your brothers most times jon answered in a flat voice but tonight lady stark thought it might give insult to the royal family to seat a bastard among them i see his uncle glanced over his shoulder at the raised table at the far end of the hall my brother does not seem very festive tonight page jon had noticed that too a bastard had to learn to notice things to read the truth that people hid behind their eyes his father was observing all the courtesies but there was tightness in him that jon had seldom seen before he said little looking out over the hall with hooded eyes seeing nothing two seats away the king had been drinking heavily all night his broad face was flushed behind his great black beard he made many a toast laughed loudly at every jest and attacked each dish like a starving man but beside him the queen seemed as cold as an ice sculpture the queen is angry too jon told his uncle in a low quiet voice father took the king down to the crypts this afternoon the queen didnt want him to go benjen gave jon a careful measuring look you dont miss much do you jon we could use a man like you on the wall jon swelled with pride robb is a stronger lance than i am but im the better sword and hullen says i sit a horse as well as anyone in the castle notable achievements take me with you when you go back to the wall jon said in a sudden rush father will give me leave to go if you ask him i know he will uncle benjen studied his face carefully the wall is a hard place for a boy jon i am almost a man grown jon protested i will turn fifteen on my next name day and maester luwin says bastards grow up faster than other children thats true enough benjen said with a downward twist of his mouth he took jons cup from the table filled it fresh from a nearby pitcher and drank down a long swallow daeren targaryen was only fourteen when he conquered dorne jon said the young dragon was one of his heroes a conquest that lasted a summer his uncle pointed out your boy king lost ten thousand men taking the place and another fifty trying to hold it someone should have told him that war isnt a game he took another sip of wine also he said wiping his mouth daeren targaryen was only eighteen when he died or have you forgotten that part i forget nothing jon boasted the wine was making him bold he tried to sit very straight to make himself seem taller i want to serve in the nights watch uncle he had thought on it long and hard lying abed at night while his brothers slept around him robb would someday inherit winterfell would command great armies as the warden of the north bran and rickon would be robbs bannermen and rule holdfasts in his name his sisters arya and sansa would marry the heirs of other great houses and go south as mistress of castles of their own but what place could a bastard hope to earn you dont know what youre asking jon the nights watch is a sworn brotherhood we have no families none of us will ever father sons our wife is duty our mistress is honor a bastard can have honor too jon said i am ready to swear your oath page you are a boy of fourteen benjen said not a man not yet until you have known a woman you cannot understand what you would be giving up i dont care about that jon said hotly you might if you knew what it meant benjen said if you knew what the oath would cost you you might be less eager to pay the price son jon felt anger rise inside him im not your son benjen stark stood up mores the pity he put a hand on jons shoulder come back to me after youve fathered a few bastards of your own and well see how you feel jon trembled i will never father a bastard he said carefully never he spat it out like venom suddenly he realized that the table had fallen silent and they were all looking at him he felt the tears begin to well behind his eyes he pushed himself to his feet i must be excused he said with the last of his dignity he whirled and bolted before they could see him cry he must have drunk more wine than he had realized his feet got tangled under him as he tried to leave and he lurched sideways into a serving girl and sent a flagon of spiced wine crashing to the floor laughter boomed all around him and jon felt hot tears on his cheeks someone tried to steady him he wrenched free of their grip and ran halfblind for the door ghost followed close at his heels out into the night the yard was quiet and empty a lone sentry stood high on the battlements of the inner wall his cloak pulled tight around him against the cold he looked bored and miserable as he huddled there alone but jon would have traded places with him in an instant otherwise the castle was dark and deserted jon had seen an abandoned holdfast once a drear place where nothing moved but the wind and the stones kept silent about whatever people had lived there winterfell reminded him of that tonight the sounds of music and song spilled through the open windows behind him they were the last things jon wanted to hear he wiped away his tears on the sleeve of his shirt furious that he had let them fall and turned to go boy a voice called out to him jon turned tyrion lannister was sitting on the ledge above the door to the great hall looking for all the world like a gargoyle the dwarf grinned down at him is that animal a wolf a direwolf jon said his name is ghost he stared up at the little man his disappointment suddenly forgotten what are you doing up there why arent you at the feast too hot too noisy and id drunk too much wine the dwarf told him i learned long ago that it is considered rude to vomit on your brother might i have a closer look at your wolf jon hesitated then nodded slowly can you climb down or shall i bring a ladder oh bleed that the little man said he pushed himself off the ledge into empty air jon gasped then page watched with awe as tyrion lannister spun around in a tight ball landed lightly on his hands then vaulted backward onto his legs ghost backed away from him uncertainly the dwarf dusted himself off and laughed i believe ive frightened your wolf my apologies hes not scared jon said he knelt and called out ghost come here come on thats it the wolf pup padded closer and nuzzled at jons face but he kept a wary eye on tyrion lannister and when the dwarf reached out to pet him he drew back and bared his fangs in a silent snarl shy isnt he lannister observed sit ghost jon commanded thats it keep still he looked up at the dwarf you can touch him now he wont move until i tell him to ive been training him i see lannister said he ruffled the snowwhite fur between ghosts ears and said nice wolf if i wasnt here hed tear out your throat jon said it wasnt actually true yet but it would be in that case you had best stay close the dwarf said he cocked his oversized head to one side and looked jon over with his mismatched eyes i am tyrion lannister i know jon said he rose standing he was taller than the dwarf it made him feel strange youre ned starks bastard arent you jon felt a coldness pass right through him he pressed his lips together and said nothing did i offend you lannister said sorry dwarfs dont have to be tactful generations of capering fools in motley have won me the right to dress badly and say any damn thing that comes into my head he grinned you are the bastard though lord eddard stark is my father jon admitted stiffly lannister studied his face yes he said i can see it you have more of the north in you than your brothers half brothers jon corrected he was pleased by the dwarf s comment but he tried not to let it show let me give you some counsel bastard lannister said never forget what you are for surely the world will not make it your strength then it can never be your weakness armor yourself in it and it will never be used to hurt you jon was in no mood for anyones counsel what do you know about being a bastard all dwarfs are bastards in their fathers eyes you are your mothers trueborn son of lannister am i the dwarf replied sardonic do tell my lord father my mother died birthing me and hes never page been sure i dont even know who my mother was jon said some woman no doubt most of them are he favored jon with a rueful grin remember this boy all dwarfs may be bastards yet not all bastards need be dwarfs and with that he turned and sauntered back into the feast whistling a tune when he opened the door the light from within threw his shadow clear across the yard and for just a moment tyrion lannister stood tall as a king catelyn f all the rooms in winterfells great keep catelyns bedchambers were the hottest she seldom had to light a fire the castle had been built over natural hot springs and the scalding waters rushed through its walls and chambers like blood through a mans body driving the chill from the stone halls filling the glass gardens with a moist warmth keeping the earth from freezing open pools smoked day and night in a dozen small courtyards that was a little thing in summer in winter it was the difference between life and death catelyns bath was always hot and steaming and her walls warm to the touch the warmth reminded her of riverrun of days in the sun with lysa and edmure but ned could never abide the heat the starks were made for the cold he would tell her and she would laugh and tell him in that case they had certainly built their castle in the wrong place so when they had finished ned rolled off and climbed from her bed as he had a thousand times before he crossed the room pulled back the heavy tapestries and threw open the high narrow windows one by one letting the night air into the chamber the wind swirled around him as he stood facing the dark naked and emptyhanded catelyn pulled the furs to her chin and watched him he looked somehow smaller and more vulnerable like the youth she had wed in the sept at riverrun fifteen long years gone her loins still ached from the urgency of his lovernaking it was a good ache she could feel his seed within her she prayed that it might quicken there it had been three years since rickon she was not too old she could give him another son i will refuse him ned said as he turned back to her his eyes were haunted his voice thick with doubt catelyn sat up in the bed you cannot you must not my duties are here in the north i have no wish to be roberts hand he will not understand that he is a king now and kings are not like other men if you refuse to serve him he will wonder why and sooner or later he will begin to suspect that you oppose him cant you see the danger that would put us in ned shook his head refusing to believe robert would never harm me or any of mine we were closer than brothers he loves me if i refuse him he will roar and curse and bluster and in a week we will laugh about it together i know the man page you knew the man she said the king is a stranger to you catelyn remembered the direwolf dead in the snow the broken antler lodged deep in her throat she had to make him see pride is everything to a king my lord robert came all this way to see you to bring you these great honors you cannot throw them back in his face honors ned laughed bitterly in his eyes yes she said and in yours and in mine she blazed angry now why couldnt he see he offers his own son in marriage to our daughter what else would you call that sansa might someday be queen her sons could rule from the wall to the mountains of dorne what is so wrong with that gods catelyn sansa is only eleven ned said and joffrey joffrey is she finished for him crown prince and heir to the iron throne and i was only twelve when my father promised me to your brother brandon that brought a bitter twist to neds mouth brandon yes brandon would know what to do he always did it was all meant for brandon you winterfell everything he was born to be a kings hand and a father to queens i never asked for this cup to pass to me perhaps not catelyn said but brandon is dead and the cup has passed and you must drink from it like it or not ned turned away from her back to the night he stood staring out in the darkness watching the moon and the stars perhaps or perhaps the sentries on the wall catelyn softened then to see his pain eddard stark had married her in brandons place as custom decreed but the shadow of his dead brother still lay between them as did the other the shadow of the woman he would not name the woman who had borne him his bastard son she was about to go to him when the knock came at the door loud and unexpected ned turned frowning what is it desmonds voice came through the door my lord maester luwin is without and begs urgent audience you told him i had left orders not to be disturbed yes my lord he insists very well send him in ned crossed to the wardrobe and slipped on a heavy robe catelyn realized suddenly how cold it had become she sat up in bed and pulled the furs to her chin perhaps we should close the windows she suggested page ned nodded absently maester luwin was shown in the maester was a small grey man his eyes were grey and quick and saw much his hair was grey what little the years had left him his robe was grey wool trimmed with white fur the stark colors its great floppy sleeves had pockets hidden inside luwin was always tucking things into those sleeves and producing other things from them books messages strange artifacts toys for the children with all he kept hidden in his sleeves catelyn was surprised that maester luwin could lift his arms at all the maester waited until the door had closed behind him before he spoke my lord he said to ned pardon for disturbing your rest i have been left a message ned looked irritated been left by whom has there been a rider i was not told there was no rider my lord only a carved wooden box left on a table in my observatory while i napped my servants saw no one but it must have been brought by someone in the kings party we have had no other visitors from the south a wooden box you say catelyn said inside was a fine new lens for the observatory from myr by the look of it the lenscrafters of myr are without equal ned frowned he had little patience for this sort of thing catelyn knew a lens he said what has that to do with me i asked the same question maester luwin said clearly there was more to this than the seeming under the heavy weight of her furs catelyn shivered a lens is an instrument to help us see indeed it is he fingered the collar of his order a heavy chain worn tight around the neck beneath his robe each link forged from a different metal catelyn could feel dread stirring inside her once again what is it that they would have us see more clearly the very thing i asked myself maester luwin drew a tightly rolled paper out of his sleeve i found the true message concealed within a false bottom when i dismantled the box the lens had come in but it is not for my eyes ned held out his hand let me have it then luwin did not stir pardons my lord the message is not for you either it is marked for the eyes of the lady catelyn and her alone may i approach catelyn nodded not trusting to speak the maester placed the paper on the table beside the bed it was sealed with a small blob of blue wax luwin bowed and began to retreat stay ned commanded him his voice was grave he looked at catelyn what is it my lady youre shaking im afraid she admitted she reached out and took the letter in trembling hands the furs dropped page away from her nakedness forgotten in the blue wax was the moonandfalcon seal of house arryn its from lysa catelyn looked at her husband it will not make us glad she told him there is grief in this message ned i can feel it ned frowned his face darkening open it catelyn broke the seal her eyes moved over the words at first they made no sense to her then she remembered lysa took no chances when we were girls together we had a private language she and l can you read it yes catelyn admitted then tell us perhaps i should withdraw maester luwin said no catelyn said we will need your counsel she threw back the furs and climbed from the bed the night air was as cold as the grave on her bare skin as she padded across the room maester luwin averted his eyes even ned looked shocked what are you doing he asked lighting a fire catelyn told him she found a dressing gown and shrugged into it then knelt over the cold hearth maester luwin ned began maester luwin has delivered all my children catelyn said this is no time for false modesty she slid the paper in among the kindling and placed the heavier logs on top of it ned crossed the room took her by the arm and pulled her to her feet he held her there his face inches from her my lady tell me what was this message catelyn stiffened in his grasp a warning she said softly if we have the wits to hear his eyes searched her face go on lysa says jon arryn was murdered his fingers tightened on her arm by whom the lannisters she told him the queen ned released his hold on her arm there were deep red marks on her skin gods he whispered his voice was hoarse your sister is sick with grief she cannot know what she is saying she knows catelyn said lysa is impulsive yes but this message was carefully planned cleverly hidden she knew it meant death if her letter fell into the wrong hands to risk so much she must have had more than mere suspicion catelyn looked to her husband now we truly have no choice you page must be roberts hand you must go south with him and learn the truth she saw at once that ned had reached a very different conclusion the only truths i know are here the south is a nest of adders i would do better to avoid luwin plucked at his chain collar where it had chafed the soft skin of his throat the hand of the king has great power my lord power to find the truth of lord arryns death to bring his killers to the kings justice power to protect lady arryn and her son if the worst be true ned glanced helplessly around the bedchamber catelyns heart went out to him but she knew she could not take him in her arms just then first the victory must be won for her childrens sake you say you love robert like a brother would you leave your brother surrounded by lannisters the others take both of you ned muttered darkly he turned away from them and went to the window she did not speak nor did the maester they waited quiet while eddard stark said a silent farewell to the home he loved when he turned away from the window at last his voice was tired and full of melancholy and moisture glittered faintly in the corners of his eyes my father went south once to answer the summons of a king he never came home again a different time maester luwin said a different king yes ned said dully he seated himself in a chair by the hearth catelyn you shall stay here in winterfell his words were like an icy draft through her heart no she said suddenly afraid was this to be her punishment never to see his face again nor to feel his arms around her yes ned said in words that would brook no argument you must govern the north in my stead while i run roberts errands there must always be a stark in winterfell robb is fourteen soon enough he will be a man grown he must learn to rule and i will not be here for him make him part of your councils he must be ready when his time comes gods will not for many years maester luwin murmured maester luwin i trust you as i would my own blood give my wife your voice in all things great and small teach my son the things he needs to know winter is coming maester luwin nodded gravely then silence fell until catelyn found her courage and asked the question whose answer she most dreaded what of the other children ned stood and took her in his arms and held her face close to his rickon is very young he said gently he should stay here with you and robb the others i would take with me i could not bear it catelyn said trembling you must he said sansa must wed joffrey that is clear now we must give them no grounds to suspect our devotion and it is past time that arya learned the ways of a southron court in a few years she will be of an age to marry too page sansa would shine in the south catelyn thought to herself and the gods knew that arya needed refinement reluctantly she let go of them in her heart but not bran never bran yes she said but please ned for the love you bear me let bran remain here at winterfell he is only seven i was eight when my father sent me to foster at the eyrie ned said ser rodrik tells me there is bad feeling between robb and prince joffrey that is not healthy bran can bridge that distance he is a sweet boy quick to laugh easy to love let him grow up with the young princes let him become their friend as robert became mine our house will be the safer for it he was right catelyn knew it it did not make the pain any easier to bear she would lose all four of them then ned and both girls and her sweet loving bran only robb and little rickon would be left to her she felt lonely already winterfell was such a vast place keep him off the walls then she said bravely you know how bran loves to climb ned kissed the tears from her eyes before they could fall thank you my lady he whispered this is hard i know what of jon snow my lord maester luwin asked catelyn tensed at the mention of the name ned felt the anger in her and pulled away many men fathered bastards catelyn had grown up with that knowledge it came as no surprise to her in the first year of her marriage to learn that ned had fathered a child on some girl chance met on campaign he had a mans needs after all and they had spent that year apart ned off at war in the south while she remained safe in her fathers castle at riverrun her thoughts were more of robb the infant at her breast than of the husband she scarcely knew he was welcome to whatever solace he might find between battles and if his seed quickened she expected he would see to the childs needs he did more than that the starks were not like other men ned brought his bastard home with him and called him son for all the north to see when the wars were over at last and catelyn rode to winterfell jon and his wet nurse had already taken up residence that cut deep ned would not speak of the mother not so much as a word but a castle has no secrets and catelyn heard her maids repeating tales they heard from the lips of her husbands soldiers they whispered of ser arthur dayne the sword of the morning deadliest of the seven knights of aeryss kingsguard and of how their young lord had slain him in single combat and they told how afterward ned had carried ser arthurs sword back to the beautiful young sister who awaited him in a castle called starfall on the shores of the summer sea the lady ashara dayne tall and fair with haunting violet eyes it had taken her a fortnight to marshal her courage but finally in bed one night catelyn had asked her husband the truth of it asked him to his face that was the only time in all their years that ned had ever frightened her never ask me about jon he said cold as ice he is my blood and that is all you need to know and now i will learn where you heard that name my lady she had pledged to obey she told him and from that day on the whispering had stopped and ashara daynes name was never heard in winterfell again whoever jons mother had been ned must have loved her fiercely for nothing catelyn said would persuade him to send the boy away it page was the one thing she could never forgive him she had come to love her husband with all her heart but she had never found it in her to love jon she might have overlooked a dozen bastards for neds sake so long as they were out of sight jon was never out of sight and as he grew he looked more like ned than any of the trueborn sons she bore him somehow that made it worse jon must go she said now he and robb are close ned said i had hoped he cannot stay here catelyn said cutting him off he is your son not mine i will not have him it was hard she knew but no less the truth ned would do the boy no kindness by leaving him here at winterfell the look ned gave her was anguished you know i cannot take him south there will be no place for him at court a boy with a bastards name you know what they will say of him he will be shunned catelyn armored her heart against the mute appeal in her husbands eyes they say your friend robert has fathered a dozen bastards himself and none of them has ever been seen at court ned blazed the lannister woman has seen to that how can you be so damnably cruel catelyn he is only a boy he his fury was on him he might have said more and worse but maester luwin cut in another solution presents itself he said his voice quiet your brother benjen came to me about jon a few days ago it seems the boy aspires to take the black ned looked shocked he asked to join the nights watch catelyn said nothing let ned work it out in his own mind her voice would not be welcome now yet gladly would she have kissed the maester just then his was the perfect solution benjen stark was a sworn brother jon would be a son to him the child he would never have and in time the boy would take the oath as well he would father no sons who might someday contest with catelyns own grandchildren for winterfell maester luwin said there is great honor in service on the wall my lord and even a bastard may rise high in the nights watch ned reflected still his voice was troubled jon is so young if he asked this when he was a man grown that would be one thing but a boy of fourteen a hard sacrifice maester luwin agreed yet these are hard times my lord his road is no crueler than yours or your ladys catelyn thought of the three children she must lose it was not easy keeping silent then ned turned away from them to gaze out the window his long face silent and thoughtful finally he sighed and turned back very well he said to maester luwin i suppose it is for the best i will speak to ben when shall we tell jon the maester asked when i must preparations must be made it will be a fortnight before we are ready to depart i would sooner let jon enjoy these last few days summer will end soon enough and childhood as well when the page time comes i will tell him myself arya a ryas stitches were crooked again she frowned down at them with dismay and glanced over to where her sister sansa sat among the other girls sansas needlework was exquisite everyone said so sansas work is as pretty as she is septa mordane told their lady mother once she has such fine delicate hands when lady catelyn had asked about arya the septa had sniffed arya has the hands of a blacksmith arya glanced furtively across the room worried that septa mordane might have read her thoughts but the septa was paying her no attention today she was sitting with the princess myrcella all smiles and admiration it was not often that the septa was privileged to instruct a royal princess in the womanly arts as she had said when the queen brought myrcella to join them arya thought that myrcellas stitches looked a little crooked too but you would never know it from the way septa mordane was cooing she studied her own work again looking for some way to salvage it then sighed and put down the needle she looked glumly at her sister sansa was chatting away happily as she worked beth cassel ser rodriks little girl was sitting by her feet listening to every word she said and jeyne poole was leaning over to whisper something in her ear what are you talking about arya asked suddenly jeyne gave her a startled look then giggled sansa looked abashed beth blushed no one answered tell me arya said jeyne glanced over to make certain that septa mordane was not listening myrcella said something then and the septa laughed along with the rest of the ladies we were talking about the prince sansa said her voice soft as a kiss arya knew which prince she meant jofftey of course the tall handsome one sansa got to sit with him at the feast arya had to sit with the little fat one naturally joffrey likes your sister jeyne whispered proud as if she had something to do with it she was the daughter of winterfells steward and sansas dearest friend he told her she was very beautiful hes going to marry her little beth said dreamily hugging herself then sansa will be queen of all the realm sansa had the grace to blush she blushed prettily she did everything prettily arya thought with dull resentment beth you shouldnt make up stories sansa corrected the younger girl gently stroking her hair to take the harshness out of her words she looked at arya what did you think of prince joff sister hes very gallant dont you think jon says he looks like a girl arya said page sansa sighed as she stitched poor jon she said he gets jealous because hes a bastard hes our brother arya said much too loudly her voice cut through the afternoon quiet of the tower room septa mordane raised her eyes she had a bony face sharp eyes and a thin lipless mouth made for frowning it was frowning now what are you talking about children our half brother sansa corrected soft and precise she smiled for the septa arya and i were remarking on how pleased we were to have the princess with us today she said septa mordane nodded indeed a great honor for us all princess myrcella smiled uncertainly at the compliment arya why arent you at work the septa asked she rose to her feet starched skirts rustling as she started across the room let me see your stitches arya wanted to scream it was just like sansa to go and attract the septas attention here she said surrendering up her work the septa examined the fabric arya arya arya she said this will not do this will not do at all everyone was looking at her it was too much sansa was too well bred to smile at her sisters disgrace but jeyne was smirking on her behalf even princess myrcella looked sorry for her arya felt tears filling her eyes she pushed herself out of her chair and bolted for the door septa mordane called after her arya come back here dont you take another step your lady mother will hear of this in front of our royal princess too youll shame us all arya stopped at the door and turned back biting her lip the tears were running down her cheeks now she managed a stiff little bow to myrcella by your leave my lady myrcella blinked at her and looked to her ladies for guidance but if she was uncertain septa mordane was not just where do you think you are going arya the septa demanded arya glared at her i have to go shoe a horse she said sweetly taking a brief satisfaction in the shock on the septas face then she whirled and made her exit running down the steps as fast as her feet would take her it wasnt fair sansa had everything sansa was two years older maybe by the time arya had been born there had been nothing left often it felt that way sansa could sew and dance and sing she wrote poetry she knew how to dress she played the high harp and the bells worse she was beautiful sansa had gotten their mothers fine high cheekbones and the thick auburn hair of the tullys arya took after their lord father her hair was a lusterless brown and her face was long and solemn jeyne used to call her arya horseface and neigh whenever she came near it hurt that the one thing arya could do better than her sister was ride a horse well that and manage a household sansa had never had much of a head for figures if she did marry prince joff arya hoped for his sake that he had a good steward nymeria was waiting for her in the guardroom at the base of the stairs she bounded to her feet as soon as she caught sight of arya arya grinned the wolf pup loved her even if no one else did they went everywhere together and nymeria slept in her room at the foot of her bed if mother had not forbidden page it arya would gladly have taken the wolf with her to needlework let septa mordane complain about her stitches then nymeria nipped eagerly at her hand as arya untied her she had yellow eyes when they caught the sunlight they gleamed like two golden coins arya had named her after the warrior queen of the rhoyne who had led her people across the narrow sea that had been a great scandal too sansa of course had named her pup lady arya made a face and hugged the wolfling tight nymeria licked her ear and she giggled by now septa mordane would certainly have sent word to her lady mother if she went to her room they would find her arya did not care to be found she had a better notion the boys were at practice in the yard she wanted to see robb put gallant prince joffrey flat on his back come she whispered to nymeria she got up and ran the wolf coming hard at her heels there was a window in the covered bridge between the armory and the great keep where you had a view of the whole yard that was where they headed they arrived flushed and breathless to find jon seated on the sill one leg drawn up languidly to his chin he was watching the action so absorbed that he seemed unaware of her approach until his white wolf moved to meet them nymeria stalked closer on wary feet ghost already larger than his litter mates smelled her gave her ear a careful nip and settled back down jon gave her a curious look shouldnt you be working on your stitches little sister arya made a face at him i wanted to see them fight he smiled come here then arya climbed up on the window and sat beside him to a chorus of thuds and grunts from the yard below to her disappointment it was the younger boys drilling bran was so heavily padded he looked as though he had belted on a featherbed and prince tommen who was plump to begin with seemed positively round they were huffing and puffing and hitting at each other with padded wooden swords under the watchful eye of old ser rodrik cassel the masteratarms a great stout keg of a man with magnificent white cheek whiskers a dozen spectators man and boy were calling out encouragement robbs voice the loudest among them she spotted theon greyjoy beside him his black doublet emblazoned with the golden kraken of his house a look of wry contempt on his face both of the combatants were staggering arya judged that they had been at it awhile a shade more exhausting than needlework jon observed a shade more fun than needlework arya gave back at him jon grinned reached over and messed up her hair arya flushed they had always been close jon had their fathers face as she did they were the only ones robb and sansa and bran and even little rickon all took after the tullys with easy smiles and fire in their hair when arya had been little she had been afraid that meant that she was a bastard too it been jon she had gone to in her fear and jon who had reassured her georgl rr martin why arent you down in the yard arya asked him page he gave her a half smile bastards are not allowed to damage young princes he said any bruises they take in the practice yard must come from trueborn swords oh arya felt abashed she should have realized for the second time today arya reflected that life was not fair she watched her little brother whack at tommen i could do just as good as bran she said hes only seven im nine jon looked her over with all his fourteenyearold wisdom youre too skinny he said he took her arm to feel her muscle then he sighed and shook his head i doubt you could even lift a longsword little sister never mind swing one arya snatched back her arm and glared at him jon messed up her hair again they watched bran and tommen circle each other you see prince joffrey jon asked she hadnt not at first glance but when she looked again she found him to the back under the shade of the high stone wall he was surrounded by men she did not recognize young squires in the livery of lannister and baratheon strangers all there were a few older men among them knights she surmised look at the arms on his surcoat jon suggested arya looked an ornate shield had been embroidered on the princes padded surcoat no doubt the needlework was exquisite the arms were divided down the middle on one side was the crowned stag of the royal house on the other the lion of lannister the lannisters are proud jon observed youd think the royal sigil would be sufficient but no he makes his mothers house equal in honor to the kings the woman is important too arya protested jon chuckled perhaps you should do the same thing little sister wed tully to stark in your arms a wolf with a fish in its mouth it made her laugh that would look silly besides if a girl cant fight why should she have a coat of arms jon shrugged girls get the arms but not the swords bastards get the swords but not the arms i did not make the rules little sister there was a shout from the courtyard below prince tommen was rolling in the dust trying to get up and failing all the padding made him look like a turtle on its back bran was standing over him with upraised wooden sword ready to whack him again once he regained his feet the men began to laugh enough ser rodrik called out he gave the prince a hand and yanked him back to his feet well fought lew donnis help them out of their armor he looked around prince joffrey robb will you go another round page robb already sweaty from a previous bout moved forward eagerly gladly joffrey moved into the sunlight in response to rodriks summons his hair shone like spun gold he looked bored this is a game for children ser rodrik theon greyjoy gave a sudden bark of laughter you are children he said derisively robb may be a child joffrey said i am a prince and i grow tired of swatting at starks with a play sword you got more swats than you gave joff robb said are you afraid prince joffrey looked at him oh terrified he said youre so much older some of the lannister men laughed jon looked down on the scene with a frown joffrey is truly a little shit he told arya ser rodrik tugged thoughtfully at his white whiskers what are you suggesting he asked the prince live steel done robb shot back youll be sorry the masteratarms put a hand on robbs shoulder to quiet him live steel is too dangerous i will permit you tourney swords with blunted edges joffrey said nothing but a man strange to arya a tall knight with black hair and burn scars on his face pushed forward in front of the prince this is your prince who are you to tell him he may not have an edge on his sword ser masteratarms of winterfell clegane and you would do well not to forget it are you training women here the burned man wanted to know he was muscled like a bull i am training knights ser rodrik said pointedly they will have steel when they are ready when they are of an age the burned man looked at robb how old are you boy fourteen robb said i killed a man at twelve you can be sure it was not with a blunt sword arya could see robb bristle his pride was wounded he turned on ser rodrik let me do it i can beat him beat him with a tourney blade then ser rodrik said joffrey shrugged come and see me when youre older stark if youre not too old there was laughter from the lannister men page robbs curses rang through the yard arya covered her mouth in shock theon greyjoy seized robbs arm to keep him away from the prince ser rodrik tugged at his whiskers in dismay joffrey feigned a yawn and turned to his younger brother come tommen he said the hour of play is done leave the children to their frolics that brought more laughter from the lannisters more curses from robb ser rodriks face was beetred with fury under the white of his whiskers theon kept robb locked in an iron grip until the princes and their party were safely away jon watched them leave and arya watched jon his face had grown as still as the pool at the heart of the godswood finally he climbed down off the window the show is done he said he bent to scratch ghost behind the ears the white wolf rose and rubbed against him you had best run back to your room little sister septa mordane will surely be lurking the longer you hide the sterner the penance youll be sewing all through winter when the spring thaw comes they will find your body with a needle still locked tight between your frozen fingers arya didnt think it was funny i hate needlework she said with passion its not fair nothing is fair jon said he messed up her hair again and walked away from her ghost moving silently beside him nymeria started to follow too then stopped and came back when she saw that arya was not coming reluctantly she turned in the other direction it was worse than jon had thought it wasnt septa mordane waiting in her room it was septa mordane and her mother bran the hunt left at dawn the king wanted wild boar at the feast tonight prince joffrey rode with his father so robb had been allowed to join the hunters as well uncle benjen jory theon greyjoy ser rodrik and even the queens funny little brother had all ridden out with them it was the last hunt after all on the morrow they left for the south bran had been left behind with jon and the girls and rickon but rickon was only a baby and the girls were only girls and jon and his wolf were nowhere to be found bran did not look for him very hard he thought jon was angry at him jon seemed to be angry at everyone these days bran did not know why he was going with uncle ben to the wall to join the nights watch that was almost as good as going south with the king robb was the one they were leaving behind not jon for days bran could scarcely wait to be off he was going to ride the kingsroad on a horse of his own not a pony but a real horse his father would be the hand of the king and they were going to live in the red castle at kings landing the castle the dragonlords had built old nan said there were ghosts there and dungeons where terrible things had been done and dragon heads on the walls it gave bran a shiver just to think of it but he was not afraid how could he be afraid his father would be with him and the king with all his knights and sworn swords page bran was going to be a knight himself someday one of the kingsguard old nan said they were the finest swords in all the realm there were only seven of them and they wore white armor and had no wives or children but lived only to serve the king bran knew all the stories their names were like music to him serwyn of the mirror shield ser ryam redwyne prince aemon the dragonknight the twins ser erryk and ser arryk who had died on one anothers swords hundreds of years ago when brother fought sister in the war the singers called the dance of the dragons the white bull gerold hightower ser arthur dayne the sword of the morning barristan the bold two of the kingsguard had come north with king robert bran had watched them with fascination never quite daring to speak to them ser boros was a bald man with a jowly face and ser meryn had droopy eyes and a beard the color of rust ser jaime lannister looked more like the knights in the stories and he was of the kingsguard too but robb said he had killed the old mad king and shouldnt count anymore the greatest living knight was ser barristan selmy barristan the bold the lord commander of the kingsguard father had promised that they would meet ser barristan when they reached kings landing and bran had been marking the days on his wall eager to depart to see a world he had only dreamed of and begin a life he could scarcely imagine yet now that the last day was at hand suddenly bran felt lost winterfell had been the only home he had ever known his father had told him that he ought to say his farewells today and he had tried after the hunt had ridden out he wandered through the castle with his wolf at his side intending to visit the ones who would be left behind old nan and gage the cook mikken in his smithy hodor the stableboy who smiled so much and took care of his pony and never said anything but hodor the man in the glass gardens who gave him a blackberry when he came to visit but it was no good he had gone to the stable first and seen his pony there in its stall except it wasnt his pony anymore he was getting a real horse and leaving the pony behind and all of a sudden bran just wanted to sit down and cry he turned and ran off before hodor and the other stableboys could see the tears in his eyes that was the end of his farewells instead bran spent the morning alone in the godswood trying to teach his wolf to fetch a stick and failing the wolfling was smarter than any of the hounds in his fathers kennel and bran would have sworn he understood every word that was said to him but he showed very little interest in chasing sticks he was still trying to decide on a name robb was calling his grey wind because he ran so fast sansa had named hers lady and arya named hers after some old witch queen in the songs and little rickon called his shaggydog which bran thought was a pretty stupid name for a direwolf jons wolf the white one was ghost bran wished he had thought of that first even though his wolf wasnt white he had tried a hundred names in the last fortnight but none of them sounded right finally he got tired of the stick game and decided to go climbing he hadnt been up to the broken tower for weeks with everything that had happened and this might be his last chance he raced across the godswood taking the long way around to avoid the pool where the heart tree grew the heart tree had always frightened him trees ought not have eyes bran thought or leaves that looked like hands his wolf came sprinting at his heels you stay here he told him at the base of the sentinel tree near the armory wall lie down thats right now stay the wolf did as he was told bran scratched him behind the ears then turned away jumped grabbed a low branch and pulled himself up he was halfway up the tree moving easily from limb to limb when the wolf got to his feet and began to howl page bran looked back down his wolf fell silent staring up at him through slitted yellow eyes a strange chill went through him he began to climb again once more the wolf howled quiet he yelled sit down stay youre worse than mother the howling chased him all the way up the tree until finally he jumped off onto the armory roof and out of sight the rooftops of winterfell were brans second home his mother often said that bran could climb before he could walk bran could not remember when he first learned to walk but he could not remember when he started to climb either so he supposed it must be true to a boy winterfell was a grey stone labyrinth of walls and towers and courtyards and tunnels spreading out in all directions in the older parts of the castle the halls slanted up and down so that you couldnt even be sure what floor you were on the place had grown over the centuries like some monstrous stone tree maester luwin told him once and its branches were gnarled and thick and twisted its roots sunk deep into the earth when he got out from under it and scrambled up near the sky bran could see all of winterfell in a glance he liked the way it looked spread out beneath him only birds wheeling over his head while all the life of the castle went on below bran could perch for hours among the shapeless rainworn gargoyles that brooded over the first keep watching it all the men drilling with wood and steel in the yard the cooks tending their vegetables in the glass garden restless dogs running back and forth in the kennels the silence of the godswood the girls gossiping beside the washing well it made him feel like he was lord of the castle in a way even robb would never know it taught him winterfells secrets too the builders had not even leveled the earth there were hills and valleys behind the walls of winterfell there was a covered bridge that went from the fourth floor of the bell tower across to the second floor of the rookery bran knew about that and he knew you could get inside the inner wall by the south gate climb three floors and run all the way around winterfell through a narrow tunnel in the stone and then come out on ground level at the north gate with a hundred feet of wall looming over you even maester luwin didnt know that bran was convinced his mother was terrified that one day bran would slip off a wall and kill himself he told her that he wouldnt but she never believed him once she made him promise that he would stay on the ground he had managed to keep that promise for almost a fortnight miserable every day until one night he had gone out the window of his bedroom when his brothers were fast asleep he confessed his crime the next day in a fit of guilt lord eddard ordered him to the godswood to cleanse himself guards were posted to see that bran remained there alone all night to reflect on his disobedience the next morning bran was nowhere to be seen they finally found him fast asleep in the upper branches of the tallest sentinel in the grove as angry as he was his father could not help but laugh youre not my son he told bran when they fetched him down youre a squirrel so be it if you must climb then climb but try not to let your mother see you bran did his best although he did not think he ever really footed her since his father would not forbid it she turned to others old nan told him a story about a bad little boy who climbed too high and was struck down by lightning and how afterward the crows came to peck out his eyes bran was not impressed there were crows nests atop the broken tower where no one ever went but him and page sometimes he filled his pockets with corn before he climbed up there and the crows ate it right out of his hand none of them had ever shown the slightest bit of interest in pecking out his eyes later maester luwin built a little pottery boy and dressed him in brans clothes and flung him off the wall into the yard below to demonstrate what would happen to bran if he fell that had been fun but afterward bran just looked at the maester and said im not made of clay and anyhow i never fall then for a while the guards would chase him whenever they saw him on the roofs and try to haul him down that was the best time of all it was like playing a game with his brothers except that bran always won none of the guards could climb half so well as bran not even jory most of the time they never saw him anyway people never looked up that was another thing he liked about climbing it was almost like being invisible he liked how it felt too pulling himself up a wall stone by stone fingers and toes digging hard into the small crevices between he always took off his boots and went barefoot when he climbed it made him feel as if he had four hands instead of two he liked the deep sweet ache it left in the muscles afterward he liked the way the air tasted way up high sweet and cold as a winter peach he liked the birds the crows in the broken tower the tiny little sparrows that nested in cracks between the stones the ancient owl that slept in the dusty loft above the old armory bran knew them all most of all he liked going places that no one else could go and seeing the grey sprawl of winterfell in a way that no one else ever saw it it made the whole castle brans secret place his favorite haunt was the broken tower once it had been a watchtower the tallest in winterfell a long time ago a hundred years before even his father had been born a lightning strike had set it afire the top third of the structure had collapsed inward and the tower had never been rebuilt sometimes his father sent ratters into the base of the tower to clean out the nests they always found among the jumble of fallen stones and charred and rotten beams but no one ever got up to the jagged top of the structure now except for bran and the crows he knew two ways to get there you could climb straight up the side of the tower itself but the stones were loose the mortar that held them together long gone to ash and bran never liked to put his full weight on them the best way was to start from the godswood shinny up the tall sentinel and cross over the armory and the guards hall leaping roof to roof barefoot so the guards wouldnt hear you overhead that brought you up to the blind side of the first keep the oldest part of the castle a squat round fortress that was taller than it looked only rats and spiders lived there now but the old stones still made for good climbing you could go straight up to where the gargoyles leaned out blindly over empty space and swing from gargoyle to gargoyle hand over hand around to the north side from there if you really stretched you could reach out and pull yourself over to the broken tower where it leaned close the last part was the scramble up the blackened stones to the eyrie no more than ten feet and then the crows would come round to see if youd brought any corn bran was moving from gargoyle to gargoyle with the ease of long practice when he heard the voices he was so startled he almost lost his grip the first keep had been empty all his life i do not like it a woman was saying there was a row of windows beneath him and the voice was page drifting out of the last window on this side you should be the hand gods forbid a mans voice replied lazily its not an honor id want theres far too much work involved bran hung listening suddenly afraid to go on they might glimpse his feet if he tried to swing by dont you see the danger this puts us in the woman said robert loves the man like a brother robert can barely stomach his brothers not that i blame him stannis would be enough to give anyone indigestion dont play the fool stannis and renly are one thing and eddard stark is quite another robert will listen to stark damn them both i should have insisted that he name you but i was certain stark would refuse him we ought to count ourselves fortunate the man said the king might as easily have named one of his brothers or even littlefinger gods help us give me honorable enemies rather than ambitious ones and ill sleep more easily by night they were talking about father bran realized he wanted to hear more a few more feet but they would see him if he swung out in front of the window we will have to watch him carefully the woman said i would sooner watch you the man said he sounded bored come back here lord eddard has never taken any interest in anything that happened south of the neck the woman said never i tell you he means to move against us why else would he leave the seat of his power a hundred reasons duty honor he yearns to write his name large across the book of history to get away from his wife or both perhaps he just wants to be warm for once in his life his wife is lady arryns sister its a wonder lysa was not here to greet us with her accusations bran looked down there was a narrow ledge beneath the window only a few inches wide he tried to lower himself toward it too far he would never reach you fret too much lysa arryn is a frightened cow that frightened cow shared jon arryns bed if she knew anything she would have gone to robert before she fled kings landing when he had already agreed to foster that weakling son of hers at casterly rock i think not she knew the boys life would be hostage to her silence she may grow bolder now that hes safe atop the eyrie mothers the man made the word sound like a curse i think birthing does something to your minds you are all mad he laughed it was a bitter sound let lady arryn grow as bold as she likes whatever she knows whatever she thinks she knows she has no proof he paused a moment or page does she do you think the king will require proof the woman said i tell you he loves me not and whose fault is that sweet sister bran studied the ledge he could drop down it was too narrow to land on but if he could catch hold as he fell past pull himself up except that might make a noise draw them to the window he was not sure what he was hearing but he knew it was not meant for his ears you are as blind as robert the woman was saying if you mean i see the same thing yes the man said i see a man who would sooner die than betray his king he betrayed one already or have you forgotten the woman said oh i dont deny hes loyal to robert thats obvious what happens when robert dies and joff takes the throne and the sooner that comes to pass the safer well all be my husband grows more restless every day having stark beside him will only make him worse hes still in love with the sister the insipid little dead sixteenyearold how long till he decides to put me aside for some new lyanna bran was suddenly very frightened he wanted nothing so much as to go back the way he had come to find his brothers only what would he tell them he had to get closer bran realized he had to see who was talking the man sighed you should think less about the future and more about the pleasures at hand stop that the woman said bran heard the sudden slap of flesh on flesh then the mans laughter bran pulled himself up climbed over the gargoyle crawled out onto the roof this was the easy way he moved across the roof to the next gargoyle right above the window of the room where they were talking all this talk is getting very tiresome sister the man said come here and be quiet bran sat astride the gargoyle tightened his legs around it and swung himself around upside down he hung by his legs and slowly stretched his head down toward the window the world looked strange upside down a courtyard swam dizzily below him its stones still wet with melted snow bran looked in the window inside the room a man and a woman were wrestling they were both naked bran could not tell who they were the mans back was to him and his body screened the woman from view as he pushed her up against a wall there were soft wet sounds bran realized they were kissing he watched wideeyed and frightened his breath tight in his throat the man had a hand down between her legs and he must have been hurting her there because the woman started to moan low in her throat stop it she said stop it stop it oh please but her voice was low and weak and she did not push him away her hands buried themselves in his hair his tangled golden hair and pulled his face down to her breast bran saw her face her eyes were closed and her mouth was open moaning her golden hair swung page from side to side as her head moved back and forth but still he recognized the queen he must have made a noise suddenly her eyes opened and she was staring right at him she screamed everything happened at once then the woman pushed the man away wildly shouting and pointing bran tried to pull himself up bending double as he reached for the gargoyle he as in too much of a hurry his hand scraped uselessly across smooth stone and in his panic his legs slipped and suddenly he was failing there was an instant of vertigo a sickening lurch as the window flashed past he shot out a hand grabbed for the ledge lost it caught it again with his other hand he swung against the building hard the impact took the breath out of him bran dangled onehanded panting faces appeared in the window above him the queen and now bran recognized the man beside her they looked as much alike as reflections in a mirror he saw us the woman said shrilly so he did the man said brans fingers started to slip he grabbed the ledge with his other hand fingernails dug into unyielding stone the man reached down take my hand he said before you fall bran seized his arm and held on tight with all his strength the man yanked him up to the ledge what are you doing the woman demanded the man ignored her he was very strong he stood bran up on the sill how old are you boy seven bran said shaking with relief his fingers had dug deep gouges in the mans forearm he let go sheepishly the man looked over at the woman the things i do for love he said with loathing he gave bran a shove screaming bran went backward out the window into empty air there was nothing to grab on to the courtyard rushed up to meet him somewhere off in the distance a wolf was howling crows circled the broken tower waiting for corn page tyrion somewhere in the great stone maze of winterfell a wolf howled the sound hung over the castle like a flag of mourning tyrion lannister looked up from his books and shivered though the library was snug and warm something about the howling of a wolf took a man right out of his here and now and left him in a dark forest of the mind running naked before the pack when the direwolf howled again tyrion shut the heavy leatherbound cover on the book he was reading a hundredyearold discourse on the changing of the seasons by a longdead maester he covered a yawn with the back of his hand his reading lamp was flickering its oil all but gone as dawn light leaked through the high windows he had been at it all night but that was nothing new tyrion lannister was not much a one for sleeping his legs were stiff and sore as he eased down off the bench he massaged some life back into them and limped heavily to the table where the septon was snoring softly his head pillowed on an open book in front of him tyrion glanced at the title a life of the grand maester aethelmure no wonder chayle he said softly the young man jerked up blinking confused the crystal of his order swinging wildly on its silver chain im off to break my fast see that you return the books to the shelves be gentle with the valyrian scrolls the parchment is very dry ayrmidons engines of war is quite rare and yours is the only complete copy ive ever seen chayle gaped at him still halfasleep patiently tyrion repeated his instructions then clapped the septon on the shoulder and left him to his tasks outside tyrion swallowed a lungful of the cold morning air and began his laborious descent of the steep stone steps that corkscrewed around the exterior of the library tower it was slow going the steps were cut high and narrow while his legs were short and twisted the rising sun had not yet cleared the walls of winterfell but the men were already hard at it in the yard below sandor cleganes rasping voice drifted up to him the boy is a long time dying i wish he would be quicker about it tyrion glanced down and saw the hound standing with young joffrey as squires swarmed around them at least he dies quietly the prince replied its the wolf that makes the noise i could scarce sleep last night clegane cast a long shadow across the hardpacked earth as his squire lowered the black helm over his head i could silence the creature if it please you he said through his open visor his boy placed a longsword in his hand he tested the weight of it slicing at the cold morning air behind him the yard rang to the clangor of steel on steel the notion seemed to delight the prince send a dog to kill a dog he exclaimed winterfell is so infested with wolves the starks would never miss one tyrion hopped off the last step onto the yard i beg to differ nephew he said the starks can count past six unlike some princes i might name joffrey had the grace at least to blush page a voice from nowhere sandor said he peered through his helm looking this way and that spirits of the air the prince laughed as he always laughed when his bodyguard did this mummers farce tyrion was used to it down here the tall man peered down at the ground and pretended to notice him the little lord tyrion he said my pardons i did not see you standing there i am in no mood for your insolence today tyrion turned to his nephew joffrey it is past time you called on lord eddard and his lady to offer them your comfort joffrey looked as petulant as only a boy prince can look what good will my comfort do them none tyrion said yet it is expected of you your absence has been noted the stark boy is nothing to me joffrey said i cannot abide the wailing of women tyrion lannister reached up and slapped his nephew hard across the face the boys cheek began to redden one word tyrion said and i will hit you again im going to tell mother joffrey exclaimed tyrion hit him again now both cheeks flamed you tell your mother tyrion told him but first you get yourself to lord and lady stark and you fall to your knees in front of them and you tell them how very sorry you are and that you are at their service if there is the slightest thing you can do for them or theirs in this desperate hour and that all your prayers go with them do you understand do you the boy looked as though he was going to cry instead he managed a weak nod then he turned and fled headlong from the yard holding his cheek tyrion watched him run a shadow fell across his face he turned to find clegane looming overhead like a cliff his sootdark armor seemed to blot out the sun he had lowered the visor on his helm it was fashioned in the likeness of a snarling black hound fearsome to behold but tyrion had always thought it a great improvement over cleganes hideously burned face the prince will remember that little lord the hound warned him the helm turned his laugh into a hollow rumble i pray he does tyrion lannister replied if he forgets be a good dog and remind him he glanced around the courtyard do you know where i might find my brother breaking fast with the queen ah tyrion said he gave sandor clegane a perfunctory nod and walked away as briskly as his stunted legs would carry him whistling he pitied the first knight to try the hound today the man did have a temper page a cold cheerless meal had been laid out in the morning room of the guest house jaime sat at table with cersei and the children talking in low hushed voices is robert still abed tyrion asked as he seated himself uninvited at the table his sister peered at him with the same expression of faint distaste she had worn since the day he was born the king has not slept at all she told him he is with lord eddard he has taken their sorrow deeply to heart he has a large heart our robert jaime said with a lazy smile there was very little that jaime took seriously tyrion knew that about his brother and forgave it during all the terrible long years of his childhood only jaime had ever shown him the smallest measure of affection or respect and for that tyrion was willing to forgive him most anything a servant approached bread tyrion told him and two of those little fish and a mug of that good dark beer to wash them down oh and some bacon burn it until it turns black the man bowed and moved off tyrion turned back to his siblings twins male and female they looked very much the part this morning both had chosen a deep green that matched their eyes their blond curls were all a fashionable tumble and gold ornaments shone at wrists and fingers and throats tyrion wondered what it would be like to have a twin and decided that he would rather not know bad enough to face himself in a looking glass every day another him was a thought too dreadful to contemplate prince tommen spoke up do you have news of bran uncle i stopped by the sickroom last night tyrion announced there was no change the maester thought that a hopeful sign i dont want brandon to die tommen said timorously he was a sweet boy not like his brother but then jaime and tyrion were somewhat less than peas in a pod themselves lord eddard had a brother named brandon as well jaime mused one of the hostages murdered by targaryen it seems to be an unlucky name oh not so unlucky as all that surely tyrion said the servant brought his plate he ripped off a chunk of black bread cersei was studying him warily what do you mean tyrion gave her a crooked smile why only that tommen may get his wish the maester thinks the boy may yet live he took a sip of beer myrcella gave a happy gasp and tommen smiled nervously but it was not the children tyrion was watching the glance that passed between jaime and cersei lasted no more than a second but he did not miss it then his sister dropped her gaze to the table that is no mercy these northern gods are cruel to let the child linger in such pain page what were the maesters words jaime asked the bacon crunched when he bit into it tyrion chewed thoughtfully for a moment and said he thinks that if the boy were going to die he would have done so already it has been four days with no change will bran get better uncle little myrcella asked she had all of her mothers beauty and none of her nature his back is broken little one tyrion told her the fall shattered his legs as well they keep him alive with honey and water or he would starve to death perhaps if he wakes he will be able to eat real food but he will never walk again if he wakes cersei repeated is that likely the gods alone know tyrion told her the maester only hopes he chewed some more bread i would swear that wolf of his is keeping the boy alive the creature is outside his window day and night howling every time they chase it away it returns the maester said they closed the window once to shut out the noise and bran seemed to weaken when they opened it again his heart beat stronger the queen shuddered there is something unnatural about those animals she said they are dangerous i will not have any of them coming south with us jaime said youll have a hard time stopping them sister they follow those girls everywhere tyrion started on his fish are you leaving soon then not near soon enough cersei said then she frowned are we leaving she echoed what about you gods dont tell me you are staying here tyrion shrugged benjen stark is returning to the nights watch with his brothers bastard i have a mind to go with them and see this wall we have all heard so much of jaime smiled i hope youre not thinking of taking the black on us sweet brother tyrion laughed what me celibate the whores would go begging from dorne to casterly rock no i just want to stand on top of the wall and piss off the edge of the world cersei stood abruptly the children dont need to hear this filth tommen myrcella come she strode briskly from the morning room her train and her pups trailing behind her jaime lannister regarded his brother thoughtfully with those cool green eyes stark will never consent to leave winterfell with his son lingering in the shadow of death he will if robert commands it tyrion said and robert will command it there is nothing lord eddard can do for the boy in any case he could end his torment jaime said i would if it were my son it would be a mercy i advise against putting that suggestion to lord eddard sweet brother tyrion said he would not take it kindly page even if the boy does live he will be a cripple worse than a cripple a grotesque give me a good clean death tyrion replied with a shrug that accentuated the twist of his shoulders speaking for the grotesques he said i beg to differ death is so terribly final while life is full of possibilities jaime smiled you are a perverse little imp arent you oh yes tyrion admitted i hope the boy does wake i would be most interested to hear what he might have to say his brothers smile curdled like sour milk tyrion my sweet brother he said darkly there are times when you give me cause to wonder whose side you are on tyrions mouth was full of bread and fish he took a swallow of strong black beer to wash it all down and grinned up wolfishly at jaime why jaime my sweet brother he said you wound me you know how much i love my family jon on climbed the steps slowly trying not to think that this might be the last time ever ghost padded silently beside him outside snow swirled through the castle gates and the yard was all noise and chaos but inside the thick stone walls it was still warm and quiet too quiet for jons liking he reached the landing and stood for a long moment afraid ghost nuzzled at his hand he took courage from that he straightened and entered the room lady stark was there beside his bed she had been there day and night for close on a fortnight not for a moment had she left brans side she had her meals brought to her there and chamber pots as well and a small hard bed to sleep on though it was said she had scarcely slept at all she fed him herself the honey and water and herb mixture that sustained life not once did she leave the room so jon had stayed away but now there was no more time he stood in the door for a moment afraid to speak afraid to come closer the window was open below a wolf howled ghost heard and lifted his head lady stark looked over for a moment she did not seem to recognize him finally she blinked what areyou doing here she asked in a voice strangely flat and emotionless i came to see bran jon said to say goodbye her face did not change her long auburn hair was dull and tangled she looked as though she had aged twenty years youve said it now go away part of him wanted only to flee but he knew that if he did he might never see bran again he took a nervous step into the room please he said page something cold moved in her eyes i told you to leave she said we dont want you here once that would have sent him running once that might even have made him cry now it only made him angry he would be a sworn brother of the nights watch soon and face worse dangers than catelyn tully stark hes my brother he said shall i call the guards call them jon said defiant you cant stop me from seeing him he crossed the room keeping the bed between them and looked down on bran where he lay she was holding one of his hands it looked like a claw this was not the bran he remembered the flesh had all gone from him his skin stretched tight over bones like sticks under the blanket his legs bent in ways that made jon sick his eyes were sunken deep into black pits open but they saw nothing the fall had shrunken him somehow he looked half a leaf as if the first strong wind would carry him off to his grave yet under the frail cage of those shattered ribs his chest rose and fell with each shallow breath bran he said im sorry i didnt come before i was afraid he could feel the tears rolling down his cheeks jon no longer cared dont die bran please were all waiting for you to wake up me and robb and the girls everyone lady stark was watching she had not raised a cry jon took that for acceptance outside the window the direwolf howled again the wolf that bran had not had time to name i have to go now jon said uncle benjen is waiting im to go north to the wall we have to leave today before the snows come he remembered how excited bran had been at the prospect of the journey it was more than he could bear the thought of leaving him behind like this jon brushed away his tears leaned over and kissed his brother lightly on the lips i wanted him to stay here with me lady stark said softly jon watched her wary she was not even looking at him she was george rr martm talking to him but for a part of her it was as though he were not even in the room i prayed for it she said dully he was my special boy i went to the sept and prayed seven times to the seven faces of god that ned would change his mind and leave him here with me sometimes prayers are answered jon did not know what to say it wasnt your fault he managed after an awkward silence her eyes found him they were full of poison i need none of your absolution bastard jon lowered his eyes she was cradling one of brans hands he took the other squeezed it fingers like the bones of birds goodbye he said he was at the door when she called out to him jon she said he should have kept going but she had page never called him by his name before he turned to find her looking at his face as if she were seeing it for the first time yes he said it should have been you she told him then she turned back to bran and began to weep her whole body shaking with the sobs jon had never seen her cry before it was a long walk down to the yard outside everything was noise and confusion wagons were being loaded men were shouting horses were being harnessed and saddled and led from the stables a light snow had begun to fall and everyone was in an uproar to be off robb was in the middle of it shouting commands with the best of them he seemed to have grown of late as if brans fall and his mothers collapse had somehow made him stronger grey wind was at his side uncle benjen is looking for you he told jon he wanted to be gone an hour ago i know jon said soon he looked around at all the noise and confusion leaving is harder than i thought for me too robb said he had snow in his hair melting from the heat of his body did you see him jon nodded not trusting himself to speak hes not going to die robb said i know it you starks are hard to kill jon agreed his voice was flat and tired the visit had taken all the strength from him robb knew something was wrong my mother she was very kind jon told him robb looked relieved good he smiled the next time i see you youll be all in black jon forced himself to smile back it was always my color how long do you think it will be soon enough robb promised he pulled jon to him and embraced him fiercely farewell snow jon hugged him back and you stark take care of bran i will they broke apart and looked at each other awkwardly uncle benjen said to send you to the stables if i saw you robb finally said i have one more farewell to make jon told him then i havent seen you robb replied jon left him standing there in the snow surrounded by wagons and wolves and horses it was a short walk to the armory he picked up his package and took the page covered bridge across to the keep arya was in her room packing a polished ironwood chest that was bigger than she was nymeria was helping arya would only have to point and the wolf would bound across the room snatch up some wisp of silk in her jaws and fetch it back but when she smelled ghost she sat down on her haunches and yelped at them arya glanced behind her saw jon and jumped to her feet she threw her skinny arms tight around his neck i was afraid you were gone she said her breath catching in her throat they wouldnt let me out to say goodbye what did you do now jon was amused arya disentangled herself from him and made a face nothing i was all packed and everything she gestured at the huge chest no more than a third full and at the clothes that were scattered all over the room septa mordane says i have to do it all over my things werent properly folded she says a proper southron lady doesnt just throw her clothes inside her chest like old rags she says is that what you did little sister well theyre going to get all messed up anyway she said who cares how theyre folded septa mordane jon told her i dont think shed like nymeria helping either the shewolf regarded him silently with her dark golden eyes its just as well i have something for you to take with you and it has to be packed very carefully her face lit up a present you could call it that close the door wary but excited arya checked the hall nymeria here guard she left the wolf out there to warn of intruders and closed the door by then jon had pulled off the rags hed wrapped it in he held it out to her aryas eyes went wide dark eyes like his a sword she said in a small hushed breath the scabbard was soft grey leather supple as sin jon drew out the blade slowly so she could see the deep blue sheen of the steel this is no toy he told her be careful you dont cut yourself the edges are sharp enough to shave with girls dont shave arya said maybe they should have you ever seen the septas legs she giggled at him its so skinny so are you jon told her i had mikken make this special the bravos use swords like this in pentos and myr and the other free cities it wont hack a mans head off but it can poke him full of holes if youre fast enough page i can be fast arya said youll have to work at it every day he put the sword in her hands showed her how to hold it and stepped back how does it feel do you like the balance i think so arya said first lesson jon said stick them with the pointy end arya gave him a whap on the arm with the flat of her blade the blow stung but jon found himself grinning like an idiot i know which end to use arya said a doubtful look crossed her face septa mordane will take it away from me not if she doesnt know you have it jon said who will i practice with youll find someone jon promised her kings landing is a true city a thousand times the size of winterfell until you find a partner watch how they fight in the yard run and ride make yourself strong and whatever you do arya knew what was coming next they said it together dont tell sansa jon messed up her hair i will miss you little sister suddenly she looked like she was going to cry i wish you were coming with us different roads sometimes lead to the same castle who knows he was feeling better now he was not going to let himself be sad i better go ill spend my first year on the wall emptying chamber pots if i keep uncle ben waiting any longer arya ran to him for a last hug put down the sword first jon warned her laughing she set it aside almost shyly and showered him with kisses when he turned back at the door she was holding it again trying it for balance i almost forgot he told her all the best swords have names like ice she said she looked at the blade in her hand does this have a name oh tell me cant you guess jon teased your very favorite thing arya seemed puzzled at first then it came to her she was that quick they said it together needle the memory of her laughter warmed him on the long ride north page daenerys daenerys targaryen wed khal drogo with fear and barbaric splendor in a field beyond the walls of pentos for the dothraki believed that all things of importance in a mans life must be done beneath the open sky drogo had called his khalasar to attend him and they had come forty thousand dothraki warriors and uncounted numbers of women children and slaves outside the city walls they camped with their vast herds raising palaces of woven grass eating everything in sight and making the good folk of pentos more anxious with every passing day my fellow magisters have doubled the size of the city guard illyrio told them over platters of honey duck and orange snap peppers one night at the manse that had been drogos the khal had joined his khalasar his estate given over to daenerys and her brother until the wedding best we get princess daenerys wedded quickly before they hand half the wealth of pentos away to sellswords and bravos ser jorah mormont jested the exile had offered her brother his sword the night dany had been sold to kbal drogo viserys had accepted eagerly mormont had been their constant companion ever since magister illyrio laughed lightly through his forked beard but viserys did not so much as smile he can have her tomorrow if he likes her brother said he glanced over at dany and she lowered her eyes so long as he pays the price illyrio waved a languid hand in the air rings glittering on his fat fingers i have told you all is settled trust me the khal has promised you a crown and you shall have it yes but when when the khal chooses illyrio said he will have the girl first and after they are wed he must make his procession across the plains and present her to the dosh khaleen at vaes dolthrak after that perhaps if the omens favor war viserys seethed with impatience i piss on dothraki omens the usurper sits on my fathers throne how long must i wait illyrio gave a massive shrug you have waited most of your life great king what is another few months another few years ser jorah who had traveled as far east as vaes dothrak nodded in agreement i counsel you to be patient your grace the dothraki are true to their word but they do things in their own time a lesser man may beg a favor from the khal but must never presume to berate him viserys bristled guard your tongue mormont or ill have it out i am no lesser man i am the rightful lord of the seven kingdoms the dragon does not beg ser jorah lowered his eyes respectfully illyrio smiled enigmatically and tore a wing from the duck honey and grease ran over his fingers and dripped down into his beard as he nibbled at the tender meat page there are no more dragons dany thought staring at her brother though she did not dare say it aloud yet that night she dreamt of one viserys was hitting her hurting her she was naked clumsy with fear she ran from him but her body seemed thick and ungainly he struck her again she stumbled and fell you woke the dragon he screamed as he kicked her you woke the dragon you woke the dragon her thighs were slick with blood she closed her eyes and whimpered as if in answer there was a hideous ripping sound and the crackling of some great fire when she looked again viserys was gone great columns of flame rose all around and in the midst of them was the dragon it turned its great head slowly when its molten eyes found hers she woke shaking and covered with a fine sheen of sweat she had never been so afraid until the day of her wedding came at last the ceremony began at dawn and continued until dusk an endless day of drinking and feasting and fighting a mighty earthen ramp had been raised amid the grass palaces and there dany was seated beside khal drogo above the seething sea of dothraki she had never seen so many people in one place nor people so strange and frightening the horselords might put on rich fabrics and sweet perfumes when they visited the free cities but out under the open sky they kept the old ways men and women alike wore painted leather vests over bare chests and horsehair leggings cinched by bronze medallion belts and the warriors greased their long braids with fat from the rendering pits they gorged themselves on horseflesh roasted with honey and peppers drank themselves blind on fermented mares milk and illyrios fine wines and spat jests at each other across the fires their voices harsh and alien in danys ears viserys was seated just below her splendid in a new black wool tunic with a scarlet dragon on the chest illyrio and ser jorah sat beside him theirs was a place of high honor just below the khals own bloodriders but dany could see the anger in her brothers lilac eyes he did not like sitting beneath her and he fumed when the slaves offered each dish first to the khal and his bride and served him from the portions they refused he could do nothing but nurse his resentment so nurse it he did his mood growing blacker by the hour at each insult to his person dany had never felt so alone as she did seated in the midst of that vast horde her brother had told her to smile and so she smiled until her face ached and the tears came unbidden to her eyes she did her best to hide them knowing how angry viserys would be if he saw her crying terrified of how khal drogo might react food was brought to her steaming joints of meat and thick black sausages and dothraki blood pies and later fruits and sweetgrass stews and delicate pastries from the kitchens of pentos but she waved it all away her stomach was a roil and she knew she could keep none of it down there was no one to talk to khal drogo shouted commands and jests down to his bloodriders and laughed at their replies but he scarcely glanced at dany beside him they had no common language dothraki was incomprehensible to her and the khal knew only a few words of the bastard valyrian of the free cities and none at all of the common tongue of the seven kingdoms she would even have welcomed the conversation of illyrio and her brother but they were too far below to hear her so she sat in her wedding silks nursing a cup of honeyed wine afraid to eat talking silently to herself i am blood of the dragon she told herself i am daenerys stormborn princess of dragonstone of the blood and seed of aegon the conqueror the sun was only a quarter of the way up the sky when she saw her page first man die drums were beating as some of the women danced for the khal drogo watched without expression but his eyes followed their movements and from time to time he would toss down a bronze medallion for the women to fight over the warriors were watching too one of them finally stepped into the circle grabbed a dancer by the arm pushed her down to the ground and mounted her right there as a stallion mounts a mare illyrio had told her that might happen the dothraki mate like the animals in their herds there is no privacy in a khalasar and they do not understand sin or shame as we do dany looked away from the coupling frightened when she realized what was happening but a second warrior stepped forward and a third and soon there was no way to avert her eyes then two men seized the same woman she heard a shout saw a shove and in the blink of an eye the arakhs were out long razorsharp blades half sword and half scythe a dance of death began as the warriors circled and slashed leaping toward each other whirling the blades around their heads shrieking insults at each clash no one made a move to interfere it ended as quickly as it began the arakhs shivered together faster than dany could follow one man missed a step the other swung his blade in a flat arc steel bit into flesh just above the dothrakis waist and opened him from backbone to belly button spilling his entrails into the dust as the loser died the winner took hold of the nearest womannot even the one they had been quarreling overand had her there and then slaves carried off the body and the dancing resumed magister illyrio had warned dany about this too a dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is deemed a dull affair he had said her wedding must have been especially blessed before the day was over a dozen men had died as the hours passed the terror grew in dany until it was all she could do not to scream she was afraid of the dothraki whose ways seemed alien and monstrous as if they were beasts in human skins and not true men at all she was afraid of her brother of what he might do if she failed him most of all she was afraid of what would happen tonight under the stars when her brother gave her up to the hulking giant who sat drinking beside her with a face as still and cruel as a bronze mask i am the blood of the dragon she told herself again when at last the sun was low in the sky khal drogo clapped his hands together and the drums and the shouting and feasting came to a sudden halt drogo stood and pulled dany to her feet beside him it was time for her bride gifts and after the gifts she knew after the sun had gone down it would be time for the first ride and the consummation of her marriage dany tried to put the thought aside but it would not leave her she hugged herself to try to keep from shaking her brother viserys gifted her with three handmaids dany knew they had cost him nothing illyrio no doubt had provided the girls irri and jhiqui were copperskinned dothraki with black hair and almondshaped eyes doreah a fairhaired blueeyed lysene girl these are no common servants sweet sister her brother told her as they were brought forward one by one illyrio and i selected them personally for you irri will teach you riding jhiqui the dothraki tongue and doreah will instruct you in the womanly arts of love he smiled thinly shes very good illyrio and i can both swear to that page ser jorah mormont apologized for his gift it is a small thing my princess but all a poor exile could afford he said as he laid a small stack of old books before her they were histories and songs of the seven kingdoms she saw written in the common tongue she thanked him with all her heart magister illyrio murmured a command and four burly slaves hurried forward bearing between them a great cedar chest bound in bronze when she opened it she found piles of the finest velvets and damasks the free cities could produce and resting on top nestled in the soft cloth three huge eggs dany gasped they were the most beautiful things she had ever seen each different than the others patterned in such rich colors that at first she thought they were crusted with jewels and so large it took both of her hands to hold one she lifted it delicately expecting that it would be made of some fine porcelain or delicate enamel or even blown glass but it was much heavier than that as if it were all of solid stone the surface of the shell was covered with tiny scales and as she turned the egg between her fingers they shimmered like polished metal in the light of the setting sun one egg was a deep green with burnished bronze flecks that came and went depending on how dany turned it another was pale cream streaked with gold the last was black as black as a midnight sea yet alive with scarlet ripples and swirls what are they she asked her voice hushed and full of wonder dragons eggs from the shadow lands beyond asshai said magister illyrio the eons have turned them to stone yet still they burn bright with beauty i shall treasure them always dany had heard tales of such eggs but she had never seen one nor thought to see one it was a truly magnificent gift though she knew that illyrio could afford to be lavish he had collected a fortune in horses and slaves for his part in selling her to khal drogo the khals bloodriders offered her the traditional three weapons and splendid weapons they were haggo gave her a great leather whip with a silver handle cohollo a magnificent arakh chased in gold and qotho a doublecurved dragonbone bow taller than she was magister illyrio and ser jorah had taught her the traditional refusals for these offerings this is a gift worthy of a great warrior blood of my blood and i am but a woman let my lord husband bear these in my stead and so khal drogo too received his bride gifts other gifts she was given in plenty by other dothraki slippers and jewels and silver rings for her hair medallion belts and painted vests and soft furs sandsilks and jars of scent needles and feathers and tiny bottles of purple glass and a gown made from the skin of a thousand mice a handsome gift khaleesi magister illyrio said of the last after he had told her what it was most lucky the gifts mounted up around her in great piles more gifts than she could possibly imagine more gifts than she could want or use and last of all khal drogo brought forth his own bride gift to her an expectant hush rippled out from the center of the camp as he left her side growing until it had swallowed the whole khalasar when he returned the dense press of dothraki giftgivers parted before him and he led the horse to her she was a young filly spirited and splendid dany knew just enough about horses to know that this was no ordinary animal there was something about her that took the breath away she was grey as the winter sea with a mane like silver smoke hesitantly she reached out and stroked the horses neck ran her fingers through the silver of her mane khal drogo said something in dothraki and magister illyrio translated silver for the silver of your hair the khal says page shes beautiful dany murmured she is the pride of the khalasar illyrio said custom decrees that the khaleesi must ride a mount worthy of her place by the side of the khal drogo stepped forward and put his hands on her waist he lifted her up as easily as if she were a child and set her on the thin dothraki saddle so much smaller than the ones she was used to dany sat there uncertain for a moment no one had told her about this part what should i do she asked illyrio it was ser jorah mormont who answered take the reins and ride you need not go far nervously dany gathered the reinsin her hands and slid her feet into the short stirrups she was only a fair rider she had spent far more time traveling by ship and wagon and palanquin than by horseback praying that she would not fall off and disgrace herself she gave the filly the lightest and most timid touch with her knees and for the first time in hours she forgot to be afraid or perhaps it was for the first time ever the silvergrey filly moved with a smooth and silken gait and the crowd parted for her every eye upon them dany found herself moving faster than she had intended yet somehow it was exciting rather than terrifying the horse broke into a trot and she smiled dothraki scrambled to clear a path the slightest pressure with her legs the lightest touch on the reins and the filly responded she sent it into a gallop and now the dothraki were hooting and laughing and shouting at her as they jumped out of her way as she turned to ride back a firepit loomed ahead directly in her path they were hemmed in on either side with no room to stop a daring she had never known filled daenerys then and she gave the filly her head the silver horse leapt the flames as if she had wings when she pulled up before magister illyrio she said tell khal drogo that he has given me the wind the fat pentoshi stroked his yellow beard as he repeated her words in dothraki and dany saw her new husband smile for the first time the last sliver of sun vanished behind the high walls of pentos to the west just then dany had lost all track of time khal drogo commanded his bloodriders to bring forth his own horse a lean red stallion as the khal was saddling the horse viserys slid close to dany on her silver dug his fingers into her leg and said please him sweet sister or i swear you will see the dragon wake as it has never woken before the fear came back to her then with her brothers words she felt like a child once more only thirteen and all alone not ready for what was about to happen to her they rode out together as the stars came out leaving the khalasar and the grass palaces behind khal drogo spoke no word to her but drove his stallion at a hard trot through the gathering dusk the tiny silver bells in his long braid rang softly as he rode i am the blood of the dragon she whispered aloud as she followed trying to keep her courage up i am the blood of the dragon i am the blood of the dragon the dragon was never afraid afterward she could not say how far or how long they had ridden but it was full dark when they stopped at a grassy place beside a small stream drogo swung off his horse and lifted her down from page hers she felt as fragile as glass in his hands her limbs as weak as water she stood there helpless and trembling in her wedding silks while he secured the horses and when he turned to look at her she began to cry khal drogo stared at her tears his face strangely empty of expression no he said he lifted his hand and rubbed away the tears roughly with a callused thumb you speak the common tongue dany said in wonder no he said again perhaps he had only that word she thought but it was one word more than she had known he had and somehow it made her feel a little better drogo touched her hair lightly sliding the silverblond strands between his fingers and murmuring softly in dothraki dany did not understand the words yet there was warmth in the tone a tenderness she had never expected from this man he put his finger under her chin and lifted her head so she was looking up into his eyes drogo towered over her as he towered over everyone taking her lightly under the arms he lifted her and seated her on a rounded rock beside the stream then he sat on the ground facing her legs crossed beneath him their faces finally at a height no he said is that the only word you know she asked him drogo did not reply his long heavy braid was coiled in the dirt beside him he pulled it over his right shoulder and began to remove the bells from his hair one by one after a moment dany leaned forward to help when they were done drogo gestured she understood slowly carefully she began to undo his braid it took a long time all the while he sat there silently watching her when she was done he shook his head and his hair spread out behind him like a river of darkness oiled and gleaming she had never seen hair so long so black so thick then it was his turn he began to undress her his fingers were deft and strangely tender he removed her silks one by one carefully while dany sat unmoving silent looking at his eyes when he bared her small breasts she could not help herself she averted her eyes and covered herself with her hands no drogo said he pulled her hands away from her breasts gently but firmly then lifted her face again to make her look at him no he repeated no she echoed back at him he stood her up then and pulled her close to remove the last of her silks the night air was chilly on her bare skin she shivered and gooseflesh covered her arms and legs she was afraid of what would come next but for a while nothing happened khal drogo sat with his legs crossed looking at her drinking in her body with his eyes after a while he began to touch her lightly at first then harder she could sense the fierce strength in his hands but he never hurt her he held her hand in his own and brushed her fingers one by one he ran a hand gently down her leg he stroked her face tracing the curve of her ears running a finger gently around her mouth he put both hands in her hair and combed it with his fingers he turned her around page massaged her shoulders slid a knuckle down the path of her spine it seemed as if hours passed before his hands finally went to her breasts he stroked the soft skin underneath until it tingled he circled her nipples with his thumbs pinched them between thumb and forefinger then began to pull at her very lightly at first then more insistently until her nipples stiffened and began to ache he stopped then and drew her down onto his lap dany was flushed and breathless her heart fluttering in her chest he cupped her face in his huge hands and looked into his eyes no he said and she knew it was a question she took his hand and moved it down to the wetness between her thighs yes she whispered as she put his finger inside her eddard the summons came in the hour before the dawn when the world was still and grey alyn shook him roughly from his dreams and ned stumbled into the predawn chill groggy from sleep to find his horse saddled and the king already mounted robert wore thick brown gloves and a heavy fur cloak with a hood that covered his ears and looked for all the world like a bear sitting a horse up stark he roared up up we have matters of state to discuss by all means ned said come inside your grace alyn lifted the flap of the tent no no no robert said his breath steamed with every word the camp is full of ears besides i want to ride out and taste this country of yours ser boros and ser meryn waited behind him with a dozen guardsmen ned saw there was nothing to do but rub the sleep from his eyes dress and mount up robert set the pace driving his huge black destrier hard as ned galloped along beside him trying to keep up he called out a question as they rode but the wind blew his words away and the king did not hear him after that ned rode in silence they soon left the kingsroad and took off across rolling plains dark with mist by then the guard had fallen back a small distance safely out of earshot but still robert would not slow dawn broke as they crested a low ridge and finally the king pulled up by then they were miles south of the main party robert was flushed and exhilarated as ned reined up beside him gods he swore laughing it feels good to get out and tide the way a man was meant to ride i swear ned this creeping along is enough to drive a man mad he had never been a patient man robert baratheon that damnable wheelhouse the way it creaks and groans climbing every bump in the road as if it were a mountain i promise you if that wretched thing breaks another axle im going to burn it and cersei can walk ned laughed i will gladly light the torch for you good man the king clapped him on the shoulder ive half a mind to leave them all behind and just keep going page a smile touched neds lips i do believe you mean it i do i do the king said what do you say ned just you and me two vagabond knights on the kingsroad our swords at our sides and the gods know what in front of us and maybe a farmers daughter or a tavern wench to warm our beds tonight would that we could ned said but we have duties now my liege to the realm to our children i to my lady wife and you to your queen we are not the boys we were you were never the boy you were robert grumbled mores the pity and yet there was that one time what was her name that common girl of yours becca no she was one of mine gods love her black hair and these sweet big eyes you could drown in them yours was aleena no you told me once was it merryl you know the one i mean your bastards mother her name was wylla ned replied with cool courtesy and i would sooner not speak of her wylla yes the king grinned she must have been a rare wench if she could make lord eddard stark forget his honor even for an hour you never told me what she looked like neds mouth tightened in anger nor will leave it be robert for the love you say you bear me i dishonored myself and i dishonored catelyn in the sight of gods and men gods have mercy you scarcely knew catelyn i had taken her to wife she was carrying my child you are too hard on yourself ned you always were damn it no woman wants baelor the blessed in her bed he slapped a hand on his knee well ill not press you if you feel so strong about it though i swear at times youre so prickly you ought to take the hedgehog as your sigil the rising sun sent fingers of light through the pale white mists of dawn a wide plain spread out beneath them bare and brown its flatness here and there relieved by long low hummocks ned pointed them out to his king the barrows of the first men robert frowned have we ridden onto a graveyard there are barrows everywhere in the north your grace ned told him this land is old and cold robert grumbled pulling his cloak more tightly around himself the guard had reined up well behind them at the bottom of the ridge well i did not bring you out here to talk of graves or bicker about your bastard there was a rider in the night from lord varys in kings landing here the king pulled a paper from his belt and handed it to ned varys the eunuch was the kings master of whisperers he served robert now as he had once served aerys targaryen ned unrolled the paper with trepidation thinking of lysa and her terrible accusation but the message did not concern lady arryn what is the source for this information do you remember ser jorah mormont would that i might forget him ned said bluntly the mormonts of bear island were an old house proud and honorable but their lands were cold and distant and poor ser jorah had tried to swell the page family coffers by selling some poachers to a tyroshi slaver as the mormonts were bannermen to the starks his crime had dishonored the north ned had made the long journey west to bear island only to find when he arrived that jorah had taken ship beyond the reach of ice and the kings justice five years had passed since then ser jorah is now in pentos anxious to earn a royal pardon that would allow him to return from exile robert explained lord varys makes good use of him so the slaver has become a spy ned said with distaste he handed the letter back i would rather he become a corpse varys tells me that spies are more useful than corpses robert said jorah aside what do you make of his report daenerys targaryen has wed some dothraki horselord what of it shall we send her a wedding gift the king frowned a knife perhaps a good sharp one and a bold man to wield it ned did not feign surprise roberts hatred of the targaryens was a madness in him he remembered the angry words they had exchanged when tywin lannister had presented robert with the corpses of rhaegars wife and children as a token of fealty ned had named that glorge rr martin murder robert called it war when he had protested that the young prince and princess were no more than babes his newmade king had replied i see no babes only dragonspawn not even jon arryn had been able to calm that storm eddard stark had ridden out that very day in a cold rage to fight the last battles of the war alone in the south it had taken another death to reconcile them lyannas death and the grief they had shared over her passing this time ned resolved to keep his temper your grace the girl is scarcely more than a child you are no tywin lannister to slaughter innocents it was said that rhaegars little girl had cried as they dragged her from beneath her bed to face the swords the boy had been no more than a babe in arms yet lord tywins soldiers had torn him from his mothers breast and dashed his head against a wall and how long will this one remain an innocent roberts mouth grew hard this child will soon enough spread her legs and start breeding more dragonspawn to plague me nonetheless ned said the murder of children it would be vile unspeakable unspeakable the king roared what aerys did to your brother brandon was unspeakable the way your lord father died that was unspeakable and rhaegar how many times do you think he raped your sister how many hundreds of times his voice had grown so loud that his horse whinnied nervously beneath him the king jerked the reins hard quieting the animal and pointed an angry finger at ned i will kill every targaryen i can get my hands on until they are as dead as their dragons and then i will piss on their graves ned knew better than to defy him when the wrath was on him if the years had not quenched roberts thirst for revenge no words of his would help you cant get your hands on this one can you he said quietly page the kings mouth twisted in a bitter grimace no gods be cursed some poxridden pentoshi cheesemonger had her brother and her walled up on his estate with pointyhatted eunuchs all around them and now hes handed them over to the dothraki i should have had them both killed years ago when it was easy to get at them but jon was as bad as you more fool listened to him jon arryn was a wise man and a good hand robert snorted the anger was leaving him as suddenly as it had come this khal drogo is said to have a hundred thousand men in his horde what would jon say to that he would say that even a million dothraki are no threat to the realm so long as they remain on the other side of the narrow sea ned replied calmly the barbarians have no ships they hate and fear the open sea the king shifted uncomfortably in his saddle perhaps there are ships to be had in the free cities though i tell you ned i do not like this marriage there are still those in the seven kingdoms who call me usurper do you forget how many houses fought for targaryen in the war they bide their time for now but give them half a chance they will murder me in my bed and my sons with me if the beggar king crosses with a dothraki horde at his back the traitors will join him he will not cross ned promised and if by some mischance he does we will throw him back into the sea once you choose a new warden of the east the king groaned for the last time i will not name the arryn boy warden i know the boy is your nephew but with targaryens climbing in bed with dothraki i would be mad to rest one quarter of the realm on the shoulders of a sickly child ned was ready for that yet we still must have a warden of the east if robert arryn will not do name one of your brothers stannis proved himself at the siege of storms end surely he let the name hang there for a moment the king frowned and said nothing he looked uncomfortable that is ned finished quietly watching unless you have already promised the honor to another for a moment robert had the grace to look startled just as quickly the look became annoyance what if i have its jaime lannister is it not robert kicked his horse back into motion and started down the ridge toward the barrows ned kept pace with him the king rode on eyes straight ahead yes he said at last a single hard word to end the matter kingslayer ned said the rumors were true then he rode on dangerous ground now he knew an able and courageous man no doubt he said carefully but his father is warden of the west robert in time ser jaime will succeed to that honor no one man should hold both east and west he left unsaid his real concern that the appointment would put half the armies of the realm into the hands of lannisters page i will fight that battle when the enemy appears on the field the king said stubbornly at the moment lord tywin looms eternal as casterly rock so i doubt that jaime will be succeeding anytime soon dont vex me about this ned the stone has been set your grace may i speak frankly i seem unable to stop you robert grumbled they rode through tall brown grasses can you trust jaime lannister he is my wifes twin a sworn brother of the kingsguard his life and fortune and honor all bound to mine as they were bound to aerys targaryens ned pointed out why should i mistrust him he has done everything i have ever asked of him his sword helped win the throne i sit on his sword helped taint the throne you sit on ned thought but he did not permit the words to pass his lips he swore a vow to protect his kings life with his own then he opened that kings throat with a sword seven hells someone had to kill aerys robert said reining his mount to a sudden halt beside an ancient barrow if jaime hadnt done it it would have been left for you or me we were not sworn brothers of the kingsguard ned said the time had come for robert to hear the whole truth he decided then and there do you remember the trident your grace i won my crown there how should i forget it you took a wound from rhaegar ned reminded him so when the targaryen host broke and ran you gave the pursuit into my hands the remnants of rhaegars army fled back to kings landing we followed aerys was in the red keep with several thousand loyalists i expected to find the gates closed to us robert gave an impatient shake of his head instead you found that our men had already taken the city what of it not our men ned said patiently lannister men the lion of lannister flew over the ramparts not the crowned stag and they had taken the city by treachery the war had raged for close to a year lords great and small had flocked to roberts banners others had remained loyal to targaryen the mighty lannisters of casterly rock the wardens of the west had remained aloof from the struggle ignoring calls to arms from both rebels and royalists aerys targaryen must have thought that his gods had answered his prayers when lord tywin lannister appeared before the gates of kings landing with an army twelve thousand strong professing loyalty so the mad king had ordered his last mad act he had opened his city to the lions at the gate treachery was a coin the targaryens knew well robert said the anger was building in him again page lannister paid them back in kind it was no less than they deserved i shall not trouble my sleep over it you were not there ned said bitterness in his voice troubled sleep was no stranger to him he had lived his lies for fourteen years yet they still haunted him at night there was no honor in that conquest the others take your honor robert swore what did any targaryen ever know of honor go down into your crypt and ask lyanna about the dragons honor you avenged lyanna at the trident ned said halting beside the king promise me ned she had whispered that did not bring her back robert looked away off into the grey distance the gods be damned it was a hollow victory they gave me a crown it was the girl i prayed them for your sister safe and mine again as she was meant to be i ask you ned what good is it to wear a crown the gods mock the prayers of kings and cowherds alike i cannot answer for the gods your grace only for what i found when i rode into the throne room that day ned said aerys was dead on the floor drowned in his own blood his dragon skulls stared down from the walls lannisters men were everywhere jaime wore the white cloak of the kingsguard over his golden armor i can see him still even his sword was gilded he was seated on the iron throne high above his knights wearing a helm fashioned in the shape of a lions head how he glittered this is well known the king complained i was still mounted i rode the length of the hall in silence between the long rows of dragon skulls it felt as though they were watching me somehow i stopped in front of the throne looking up at him his golden sword was across his legs its edge red with a kings blood my men were filling the room behind me lannisters men drew back i never said a word i looked at him seated there on the throne and i waited at last jaime laughed and got up he took off his helm and he said to me have no fear stark i was only keeping it warm for our friend robert its not a very comfortable seat im afraid the king threw back his head and roared his laughter startled a flight of crows from the tall brown grass they took to the air in a wild beating of wings you think i should mistrust lannister because he sat on my throne for a few moments he shook with laughter again jaime was all of seventeen ned scarce more than a boy boy or man he had no right to that throne perhaps he was tired robert suggested killing kings is weary work gods know theres no place else to rest your ass in that damnable room and he spoke truly it is a monstrous uncomfortable chair in more ways than one the king shook his head well now i know jaimes dark sin and the matter can be forgotten i am heartily sick of secrets and squabbles and matters of state ned its all as tedious as counting coppers come lets ride you used to know how i want to feel the wind in my hair again he kicked his horse back into motion and galloped up over the barrow page raining earth down behind him for a moment ned did not follow he had run out of words and he was filled with a vast sense of helplessness not for the first time he wondered what he was doing here and why he had come he was no jon arryn to curb the wildness of his king and teach him wisdom robert would do what he pleased as he always had and nothing ned could say or do would change that he belonged in winterfell he belonged with catelyn in her grief and with bran a man could not always be where he belonged though resigned eddard stark put his boots into his horse and set off after the king tyrion the north went on forever tyrion lannister knew the maps as well as anyone but a fortnight on the wild track that passed for the kingsroad up here had brought home the lesson that the map was one thing and the land quite another they had left winterfell on the same day as the king amidst all the commotion of the royal departure riding out to the sound of men shouting and horses snorting to the rattle of wagons and the groaning of the queens huge wheelhouse as a light snow flurried about them the kingsroad was just beyond the sprawl of castle and town there the banners and the wagons and the columns of knights and freeriders turned south taking the tumult with them while tyrion turned north with benjen stark and his nephew it had grown colder after that and far more quiet west of the road were flint hills grey and rugged with tall watchtowers on their stony summits to the east the land was lower the ground flattening to a rolling plain that stretched away as far as the eye could see stone bridges spanned swift narrow rivers while small farms spread in rings around holdfasts walled in wood and stone the road was well trafficked and at night for their comfort there were rude inns to be found three days ride from winterfell however the farmland gave way to dense wood and the kingsroad grew lonely the flint hills rose higher and wilder with each passing mile until by the fifth day they had turned into mountains cold bluegrey giants with jagged promontories and snow on their shoulders when the wind blew from the north long plumes of ice crystals flew from the high peaks like banners with the mountains a wall to the west the road veered north by northeast through the wood a forest of oak and evergreen and black brier that seemed older and darker than any tyrion had ever seen the wolfswood benjen stark called it and indeed their nights came alive with the howls of distant packs and some not so distant jon snows albino direwolf pricked up his ears at the nightly howling but never raised his own voice in reply there was something very unsettling about that animal tyrion thought page there were eight in the party by then not counting the wolf tyrion traveled with two of his own men as befit a lannister benjen stark had only his bastard nephew and some fresh mounts for the nights watch but at the edge of the wolfswood they stayed a night behind the wooden walls of a forest holdfast and there joined up with another of the black brothers one yoren yoren was stooped and sinister his features hidden behind a beard as black as his clothing but he seemed as tough as an old root and as hard as stone with him were a pair of ragged peasant boys from the fingers rapers yoren said with a cold look at his charges tyrion understood life on the wall was said to be hard but no doubt it was preferable to castration five men three boys a direwolf twenty horses and a cage of ravens given over to benjen stark by maester luwin no doubt they made a curious fellowship for the kingsroad or any road tyrion noticed jon snow watching yoren and his sullen companions with an odd cast to his face that looked uncomfortably like dismay yoren had a twisted shoulder and a sour smell his hair and beard were matted and greasy and full of lice his clothing old patched and seldom washed his two young recruits smelled even worse and seemed as stupid as they were cruel no doubt the boy had made the mistake of thinking that the nights watch was made up of men like his uncle if so yoren and his companions were a rude awakening tyrion felt sorry for the boy he had chosen a hard life or perhaps he should say that a hard life had been chosen for him he had rather less sympathy for the uncle benjen stark seemed to share his brothers distaste for lannisters and he had not been pleased when tyrion had told him of his intentions i warn you lannister youll find no inns at the wall he had said looking down on him no doubt youll find some place to put me tyrion had replied as you might have noticed im small one did not say no to the queens brother of course so that had settled the matter but stark had not been happy you will not like the ride i promise you that hed said curtly and since the moment they set out he had done all he could to live up to that promise by the end of the first week tyrions thighs were raw from hard riding his legs were cramping badly and he was chilled to the bone he did not complain he was damned if he would give benjen stark that satisfaction he took a small revenge in the matter of his riding fur a tattered bearskin old and mustysmelling stark had offered it to him in an excess of nights watch gallantry no doubt expecting him to graciously decline tyrion had accepted with a smile he had brought his warmest clothing with him when they rode out of winterfell and soon discovered that it was nowhere near warm enough it was cold up here and growing colder the nights were well below freezing now and when the wind blew it was like a knife cutting right through his warmest woolens by now stark was no doubt regretting his chivalrous impulse perhaps he had learned a lesson the lannisters never declined graciously or otherwise the lannisters took what was offered farms and holdfasts grew scarcer and smaller as they pressed northward ever deeper into the darkness of the wolfswood until finally there were no more roofs to shelter under and they were thrown back on their own resources page tyrion was never much use in making a camp or breaking one too small too hobbled too intheway so while stark and yoren and the other men erected rude shelters tended the horses and built a fire it became his custom to take his fur and a wineskin and go off by himself to read on the eighteenth night of their journey the wine was a rare sweet amber from the summer isles that he had brought all the way north from casterly rock and the book a rumination on the history and properties of dragons with lord eddard starks permission tyrion had borrowed a few rare volumes from the winterfell library and packed them for the ride north he found a comfortable spot just beyond the noise of the camp beside a swiftrunning stream with waters clear and cold as ice a grotesquely ancient oak provided shelter from the biting wind tyrion curled up in his fur with his back against the trunk took a sip of the wine and began to read about the properties of dragonbone dragonbone is black because of its high iron content the book told him it is strong as steel yet lighter and far more flexible and of course utterly impervious to fire dragonbone bows are greatly prized by the dothraki and small wonder an archer so armed can outrange any wooden bow tyrion had a morbid fascination with dragons when he had first come to kings landing for his sisters wedding to robert baratheon he had made it a point to seek out the dragon skulls that had hung on the walls of targaryens throne room king robert had replaced them with banners and tapestries but tyrion had persisted until he found the skulls in the dank cellar where they had been stored he had expected to find them impressive perhaps even frightening he had not thought to find them beautiful yet they were as black as onyx polished smooth so the bone seemed to shimmer in the light of his torch they liked the fire he sensed hed thrust the torch into the mouth of one of the larger skulls and made the shadows leap and dance on the wall behind him the teeth were long curving knives of black diamond the flame of the torch was nothing to them they had bathed in the heat of far greater fires when he had moved away tyrion could have sworn that the beasts empty eye sockets had watched him go there were nineteen skulls the oldest was more than three thousand years old the youngest a mere century and a half the most recent were also the smallest a matched pair no bigger than mastiffs skulls and oddly misshapen all that remained of the last two hatchlings born on dragonstone they were the last of the targaryen dragons perhaps the last dragons anywhere and they had not lived very long from there the skulls ranged upward in size to the three great monsters of song and story the dragons that aegon targaryen and his sisters had unleashed on the seven kingdoms of old the singers had given them the names of gods balerion meraxes vhaghar tyrion had stood between their gaping jaws wordless and awed you could have ridden a horse down vhaghars gullet although you would not have ridden it out again meraxes was even bigger and the greatest of them balerion the black dread could have swallowed an aurochs whole or even one of the hairy mammoths said to roam the cold wastes beyond the port of ibben tyrion stood in that dank cellar for a long time staring at balerions huge emptyeyed skull until his torch burned low trying to grasp the size of the living animal to imagine how it must have looked when it spread its great black wings and swept across the skies breathing fire a gaml of thrones page his own remote ancestor king loren of the rock had tried to stand against the fire when he joined with king mern of the reach to oppose the targaryen conquest that was close on three hundred years ago when the seven kingdoms were kingdoms and not mere provinces of a greater realm between them the two kings had six hundred banners flying five thousand mounted knights and ten times as many freeriders and menatarms aegon dragonlord had perhaps a fifth that number the chroniclers said and most of those were conscripts from the ranks of the last king he had slain their loyalties uncertain the hosts met on the broad plains of the reach amidst golden fields of wheat ripe for harvest when the two kings charged the targaryen army shivered and shattered and began to run for a few moments the chroniclers wrote the conquest was at an end but only for those few moments before aegon targaryen and his sisters joined the battle it was the only time that vhaghar meraxes and balerion were all unleashed at once the singers called it the field of fire near four thousand men had burned that day among them king mern of the reach king loren had escaped and lived long enough to surrender pledge his fealty to the targaryens and beget a son for which tyrion was duly grateful why do you read so much tyrion looked up at the sound of the voice jon snow was standing a few feet away regarding him curiously he closed the book on a finger and said look at me and tell me what you see the boy looked at him suspiciously is this some kind of trick i see you tyrion lannister tyrion sighed you are remarkably polite for a bastard snow what you see is a dwarf you are what twelve fourteen the boy said fourteen and youre taller than i will ever be my legs are short and twisted and i walk with difficulty i require a special saddle to keep from falling off my horse a saddle of my own design you may be interested to know it was either that or ride a pony my arms are strong enough but again too short i will never make a swordsman had i been born a peasant they might have left me out to die or sold me to some slavers grotesquerie alas i was born a lannister of casterly rock and the grotesqueries are all the poorer things are expected of me my father was the hand of the king for twenty years my brother later killed that very same king as it turns out but life is full of these little ironies my sister married the new king and my repulsive nephew will be king after him i must do my part for the honor of my house wouldnt you agree yet how well my legs may be too small for my body but my head is too large although i prefer to think it is just large enough for my mind i have a realistic grasp of my own strengths and weaknesses my mind is my weapon my brother has his sword king robert has his warhammer and i have my mind and a mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone if it is to keep its edge tyrion tapped the leather cover of the book thats why i read so much jon snow page the boy absorbed that all in silence he had the stark face if not the name long solemn guarded a face that gave nothing away whoever his mother had been she had left little of herself in her son what are you reading about he asked dragons tyrion told him what good is that there are no more dragons the boy said with the easy certainty of youth so they say tyrion replied sad isnt it when i was your age used to dream of having a dragon of my own you did the boy said suspiciously perhaps he thought tyrion was making fun of him oh yes even a stunted twisted ugly little boy can look down over the world when hes seated on a dragons back tyrion pushed the bearskin aside and climbed to his feet i used to start fires in the bowels of casterly rock and stare at the flames for hours pretending they were dragonfire sometimes id imagine my father burning at other times my sister jon snow was staring at him a look equal parts horror and fascination tyrion guffawed dont look at me that way bastard i know your secret youve dreamt the same kind of dreams no jon snow said horrified i wouldnt no never tyrion raised an eyebrow well no doubt the starks have been terribly good to you im certain lady stark treats you as if you were one of her own and your brother robb hes always been kind and why not he gets winterfell and you get the wall and your father he must have good reasons for packing you off to the nights watch stop it jon snow said his face dark with anger the nights watch is a noble calling tyrion laughed youre too smart to believe that the nights watch is a midden heap for all the misfits of the realm ive seen you looking at yoren and his boys those are your new brothers jon snow how do you like them sullen peasants debtors poachers rapers thieves and bastards like you all wind up on the wall watching for grumkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about the good part is there are no grumkins or snarks so its scarcely dangerous work the bad part is you freeze your balls off but since youre not allowed to breed anyway i dont suppose that matters stop it the boy screamed he took a step forward his hands coiling into fists close to tears suddenly absurdly tyrion felt guilty he took a step forward intending to give the boy a reassuring pat on the shoulder or mutter some word of apology he never saw the wolf where it was or how it came at him one moment he was walking toward snow and the next he was flat on his back on the hard rocky ground the book spinning away from him as he fell the breath going out of him at the sudden impact his mouth full of dirt and blood and rotting leaves as he tried to get up his back spasmed painfully he must have wrenched it in the fall he ground his teeth in frustration grabbed a root and pulled himself back to a sitting position help me he said to the boy reaching up a hand page and suddenly the wolf was between them he did not growl the damned thing never made a sound he only looked at him with those bright red eyes and showed him his teeth and that was more than enough tyrion sagged back to the ground with a grunt dont help me then ill sit right here until you leave jon snow stroked ghosts thick white fur smiling now ask me nicely tyrion lannister felt the anger coiling inside him and crushed it out with a will it was not the first time in his life he had been humiliated and it would not be the last perhaps he even deserved this i should be very grateful for your kind assistance jon he said mildly down ghost the boy said the direwolf sat on his haunches those red eyes never left tyrion jon came around behind him slid his hands under his arms and lifted him easily to his feet then he picked up the book and handed it back why did he attack me tyrion asked with a sidelong glance at the direwolf he wiped blood and dirt from his mouth with the back of his hand maybe he thought you were a grumkin tyrion glanced at him sharply then he laughed a raw snort of amusement that came bursting out through his nose entirely without his permission oh gods he said choking on his laughter and shaking his head i suppose i do rather look like a grumkin what does he do to snarks you dont want to know jon picked up the wineskin and handed it to tyrion tyrion pulled out the stopper tilted his head and squeezed a long stream into his mouth the wine was cool fire as it trickled down his throat and warmed his belly he held out the skin to jon snow want some the boy took the skin and tried a cautious swallow its true isnt it he said when he was done what you said about the nights watch tyrion nodded jon snow set his mouth in a grim line if thats what it is thats what it is tyrion grinned at him thats good bastard most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it most men the boy said but not you no tyrion admitted not me i seldom even dream of dragons anymore there are no dragons he scooped up the fallen bearskin come we had better return to camp before your uncle calls the banners the walk was short but the ground was rough underfoot and his legs were cramping badly by the time they got back jon snow offered a hand to help him over a thick tangle of roots but tyrion shook him off he would make his own way as he had all his life still the camp was a welcome sight the shelters had been thrown up against the tumbledown wall of a longabandoned holdfast a shield against the wind page the horses had been fed and a fire had been laid yoren sat on a stone skinning a squirrel the savory smell of stew filled tyrions nostrils he dragged himself over to where his man morrec was tending the stewpot wordlessly morrec handed him the ladle tyrion tasted and handed it back more pepper he said benjen stark emerged from the shelter he shared with his nephew there you are jon damn it dont go off like that by yourself i thought the others had gotten you it was the grumkins tyrion told him laughing jon snow smiled stark shot a baffled look at yoren the old man grunted shrugged and went back to his bloody work the squirrel gave some body to the stew and they ate it with black bread and hard cheese that night around their fire tyrion shared around his skin of wine until even yoren grew mellow one by one the company drifted off to their shelters and to sleep all but jon snow who had drawn the nights first watch tyrion was the last to retire as always as he stepped into the shelter his men had built for him he paused and looked back at jon snow the boy stood near the fire his face still and hard looking deep into the flames tyrion lannister smiled sadly and went to bed catelyn ned and the girls were eight days gone when maester luwin came to her one night in brans sickroom carrying a reading lamp and the books of account it is past time that we reviewed the figures my lady he said youll want to know how much this royal visit cost us catelyn looked at bran in his sickbed and brushed his hair back off his forehead it had grown very long she realized she would have to cut it soon i have no need to look at figures maester luwin she told him never taking her eyes from bran i know what the visit cost us take the books away my lady the kings party had healthy appetites we must replenish our stores before she cut him off i said take the books away the steward will attend to our needs we have no steward maester luwin reminded her like a little grey rat she thought he would not let go poole went south to establish lord eddards household at kings landing catelyn nodded absently oh yes i remember bran looked so pale she wondered whether they might move his bed under the window so he could get the morning sun maester luwin set the lamp in a niche by the door and fiddled with its wick there are several appointments that require your immediate page attention my lady besides the steward we need a captain of the guards to fill jorys place a new master of horse her eyes snapped around and found him a master of horse her voice was a whip the maester was shaken yes my lady hullen rode south with lord eddard so my son lies here broken and dying luwin and you wish to discuss a new master of horse do you think i care what happens in the stables do you think it matters to me one whit i would gladly butcher every horse in winterfell with my own hands if it would open brans eyes do you understand that do you he bowed his head yes my lady but the appointments ill make the appointments robb said catelyn had not heard him enter but there he stood in the doorway looking at her she had been shouting she realized with a sudden flush of shame what was happening to her she was so tired and her head hurt all the time maester luwin looked from catelyn to her son i have prepared a list of those we might wish to consider for the vacant offices he said offering robb a paper plucked from his sleeve her son glanced at the names he had come from outside catelyn saw his cheeks were red from the cold his hair shaggy and windblown good men he said well talk about them tomorrow he handed back the list of names very good my lord the paper vanished into his sleeve leave us now robb said maester luwin bowed and departed robb closed the door behind him and turned to her he was wearing a sword she saw mother what are you doing catelyn had always thought robb looked like her like bran and rickon and sansa he had the tully coloring the auburn hair the blue eyes yet now for the first time she saw something of eddard stark in his face something as stern and hard as the north what am i doing she echoed puzzled how can you ask that what do you imagine im doing i am taking care of your brother i am taking care of bran is that what you call it you havent left this room since bran was hurt you didnt even come to the gate when father and the girls went south i said my farewells to them here and watched them ride out from that window she had begged ned not to go not now not after what had happened everything had changed now couldnt he see that it was no use he had no choice he had told her and then he left choosing i cant leave him even for a moment not when any moment could be his last i have to be with him if if she took her sons limp hand sliding his fingers through her own he was so frail and thin with no strength left in his hand but she could still feel the warmth of life through his skin page robbs voice softened hes not going to die mother maester luwin says the time of greatest danger has passed and what if maester luwin is wrong what if bran needs me and im not here rickon needs you robb said sharply hes only three he doesnt understand whats happening he thinks everyone has deserted him so he follows me around all day clutching my leg and crying i dont know what to do with him he paused a moment chewing on his lower lip the way hed done when he was little mother i need you too im trying but i cant i cant do it all by myself his voice broke with sudden emotion and catelyn remembered that he was only fourteen she wanted to get up and go to him but bran was still holding her hand and she could not move outside the tower a wolf began to howl catelyn trembled just for a second brans robb opened the window and let the night air into the stuffy tower room the howling grew louder it was a cold and lonely sound full of melancholy and despair dont she told him bran needs to stay warm he needs to hear them sing robb said somewhere out in winterfell a second wolf began to howl in chorus with the first then a third closer shaggydog and grey wind robb said as their voices rose and fell together you can tell them apart if you listen close catelyn was shaking it was the grief the cold the howling of the direwolves night after night the howling and the cold wind and the grey empty castle on and on they went never changing and her boy lying there broken the sweetest of her children the gentlest bran who loved to laugh and climb and dreamt of knighthood all gone now she would never hear him laugh again sobbing she pulled her hand free of his and covered her ears against those terrible howls make them stop she cried i cant stand it make them stop make them stop kill them all if you must just make them stop she didnt remember falling to the floor but there she was and robb was lifting her holding her in strong arms dont be afraid mother they would never hurt him he helped her to her narrow bed in the corner of the sickroom close your eyes he said gently rest maester luwin tells me youve hardly slept since brans fall i cant she wept gods forgive me robb i cant what if he dies while im asleep what if he dies what if he dies the wolves were still howling she screamed and held her ears again oh gods close the window if you swear to me youll sleep robb went to the window but as he reached for the shutters another sound was added to the mournful howling of the direwolves dogs he said listening all the dogs are barking theyve never done that before catelyn heard his breath catch in his throat when she looked up his face was pale in the lamplight fire he whispered fire she thought and then bran help me she said urgently sitting up help me with bran robb did not seem to hear her the library towers on fire he said page catelyn could see the flickering reddish light through the open window now she sagged with relief bran was safe the library was across the bailey there was no way the fire would reach them here thank the gods she whispered robb looked at her as if shed gone mad mother stay here ill come back as soon as the fires out he ran then she heard him shout to the guards outside the room heard them descending together in a wild rush taking the stairs two and three at a time outside there were shouts of fire in the yard screams running footsteps the whinny of frightened horses and the frantic barking of the castle dogs the howling was gone she realized as she listened to the cacophony the direwolves had fallen silent catelyn said a silent prayer of thanks to the seven faces of god as she went to the window across the bailey long tongues of flame shot from the windows of the library she watched the smoke rise into the sky and thought sadly of all the books the starks had gathered over the centuries then she closed the shutters when she turned away from the window the man was in the room with her you werent sposed to be here he muttered sourly no one was sposed to be here he was a small dirty man in filthy brown clothing and he stank of horses catelyn knew all the men who worked in their stables and he was none of them he was gaunt with limp blond hair and pale eyes deepsunk in a bony face and there was a dagger in his hand catelyn looked at the knife then at bran no she said the word stuck in her throat the merest whisper he must have heard her its a mercy he said hes dead already no catelyn said louder now as she found her voice again no you cant she spun back toward the window to scream for help but the man moved faster than she would have believed one hand clamped down over her mouth and yanked back her head the other brought the dagger up to her windpipe the stench of him was overwhelming she reached up with both hands and grabbed the blade with all her strength pulling it away from her throat she heard him cursing into her ear her fingers were slippery with blood but she would not let go of the dagger the hand over her mouth clenched more tightly shutting off her air catelyn twisted her head to the side and managed to get a piece of his flesh between her teeth she bit down hard into his palm the man grunted in pain she ground her teeth together and tore at him and all of a sudden he let go the taste of his blood filled her mouth she sucked in air and screamed and he grabbed her hair and pulled her away from him and she stumbled and went down and then he was standing over her breathing hard shaking the dagger was still clutched tightly in his right hand slick with blood you werent sposed to be here he repeated stupidly catelyn saw the shadow slip through the open door behind him there was a low rumble less than a snarl the merest whisper of a threat but he must have heard something because he started to turn just as the wolf made its leap they went down together half sprawled over catelyn where shed fallen the page wolf had him under the jaw the mans shriek lasted less than a second before the beast wrenched back its head taking out half his throat his blood felt like warm rain as it sprayed across her face the wolf was looking at her its jaws were red and wet and its eyes glowed golden in the dark room it was brans wolf she realized of course it was thank you catelyn whispered her voice faint and tiny she lifted her hand trembling the wolf padded closer sniffed at her fingers then licked at the blood with a wet rough tongue when it had cleaned all the blood off her hand it turned away silently and jumped up on brans bed and lay down beside him catelyn began to laugh hysterically that was the way they found them when robb and maester luwin and ser rodrik burst in with half the guards in winterfell when the laughter finally died in her throat they wrapped her in warm blankets and led her back to the great keep to her own chambers old nan undressed her and helped her into a scalding hot bath and washed the blood off her with a soft cloth afterward maester luwin arrived to dress her wounds the cuts in a came of thrones her fingers went deep almost to the bone and her scalp was raw and bleeding where hed pulled out a handful of hair the maester told her the pain was just starting now and gave her milk of the poppy to help her sleep finally she closed her eyes when she opened them again they told her that she had slept four days catelyn nodded and sat up in bed it all seemed like a nightmare to her now everything since brans fall a terrible dream of blood and grief but she had the pain in her hands to remind her that it was real she felt weak and lightheaded yet strangely resolute as if a great weight had lifted from her bring me some bread and honey she told her servants and take word to maester luwin that my bandages want changing they looked at her in surprise and ran to do her bidding catelyn remembered the way she had been before and she was ashamed she had let them all down her children her husband her house it would not happen again she would show these northerners how strong a tully of riverrun could be robb arrived before her food rodrik cassel came with him and her husbands ward theon greyjoy and lastly hallis mollen a muscular guardsman with a square brown beard he was the new captain of the guard robb said her son was dressed in boiled leather and ringmail she saw and a sword hung at his waist who was he catelyn asked them no one knows his name hallis mollen told her he was no man of winterfell mlady but some says they seen him here and about the castle these past few weeks one of the kings men then she said or one of the lannisters he could have waited behind when the others left page maybe hal said with all these strangers filling up winterfell of late theres no way of saying who he belonged to hed been biding in your stables greyjoy said you could smell it on him and how could he go unnoticed she said sharply hallis mollen looked abashed between the horses lord eddard took south and them we sent north to the nights watch the stalls were halfempty it were no great trick to hide from the stableboys could be hodor saw him the talk is that boys been acting queer but simple as he is hal shook his head we found where hed been sleeping robb put in he had ninety silver stags in a leather bag buried beneath the straw its good to know my sons life was not sold cheaply catelyn said bitterly hallis mollen looked at her confused begging your grace mlady you saying he was out to kill your boy greyjoy was doubtful thats madness he came for bran catelyn said he kept muttering how i wasnt supposed to be there he set the library fire thinking i would rush to put it out taking any guards with me if i hadnt been halfmad with grief it would have worked why would anyone want to kill bran robb said gods hes only a little boy helpless sleeping catelyn gave her firstborn a challenging look if you are to rule in the north you must think these things through robb answer your own question why would anyone want to kill a sleeping child before he could answer the servants returned with a plate of food fresh from the kitchen there was much more than shed asked for hot bread butter and honey and blackberry preserves a rasher of bacon and a softboiled egg a wedge of cheese a pot of mint tea and with it came maester luwin how is my son maester catelyn looked at all the food and found she had no appetite maester luwin lowered his eyes unchanged my lady it was the reply she had expected no more and no less her hands throbbed with pain as if the blade were still in her cutting deep she sent the servants away and looked back to robb do you have the answer yet someone is afraid bran might wake up robb said afraid of what he might say or do afraid of something he knows catelyn was proud of him very good she turned to the new captain of the guard we must keep bran safe if there was one killer there could be others how many guards do you want rnlady hal asked page so long as lord eddard is away my son is the master of winterfell she told him robb stood a little taller put one man in the sickroom night and day one outside the door two at the bottom of the stairs no one sees bran without my warrant or my mothers as you say mlord do it now catelyn suggested and let his wolf stay in the room with him robb added yes catelyn said and then again yes hallis mollen bowed and left the room lady stark ser rodrik said when the guardsman had gone did you chance to notice the dagger the killer used the circumstances did not allow me to examine it closely but i can vouch for its edge catelyn replied with a dry smile why do you ask we found the knife still in the villains grasp it seemed to me that it was altogether too fine a weapon for such a man so i looked at it long and hard the blade is valyrian steel the hilt dragonbone a weapon like that has no business being in the hands of such as him someone gave it to him catelyn nodded thoughtful robb close the door he looked at her strangely but did as she told him what i am about to tell you must not leave this room she told them i want your oaths on that if even part of what i suspect is true ned and my girls have ridden into deadly danger and a word in the wrong ears could mean their lives lord eddard is a second father to me said theon greyjoy i do so swear you have my oath maester luwin said and mine my lady echoed ser rodrik she looked at her son and you robb he nodded his consent my sister lysa believes the lannisters murdered her husband lord arryn the hand of the king catelyn told them it comes to me that jaime lannister did not join the hunt the day bran fell he remained here in the castle the room was deathly quiet i do not think bran fell from that tower she said into the stillness i think he was thrown page the shock was plain on their faces my lady that is a monstrous suggestion said rodrik cassel even the kingslayer would flinch at the murder of an innocent child oh would he theon greyjoy asked i wonder there is no limit to lannister pride or lannister ambition catelyn said the boy had always been surehanded in the past maester luwin said thoughtfully he knew every stone in winterfell gods robb swore his young face dark with anger if this is true he will pay for it he drew his sword and waved it in the air ill kill him myself ser rodrik bristled at him put that away the lannisters are a hundred leagues away never draw your sword unless you mean to use it how many times must i tell you foolish boy glorgl rr martin abashed robb sheathed his sword suddenly a child again catelyn said to ser rodrik i see my son is wearing steel now the old masteratarms said i thought it was time robb was looking at her anxiously past time she said winterfell may have need of all its swords soon and they had best not be made of wood theon greyjoy put a hand on the hilt of his blade and said my lady if it comes to that my house owes yours a great debt maester luwin pulled at his chain collar where it chafed against his neck all we have is conjecture this is the queens beloved brother we mean to accuse she will not take it kindly we must have proof or forever keep silent your proof is in the dagger ser rodrik said a fine blade like that will not have gone unnoticed there was only one place to find the truth of it catelyn realized someone must go to kings landing ill go robb said no she told him your place is here there must always be a stark in winterfell she looked at ser rodrik with his great white whiskers at maester luwin in his grey robes at young greyjoy lean and dark and impetuous who to send who would be believed then she knew catelyn struggled to push back the blankets her bandaged fingers as stiff and unyielding as stone she climbed out of bed i must go myself my lady said maester luwin is that wise surely the lannisters would greet your arrival with suspicion what about bran robb asked the poor boy looked utterly confused now you cant mean to leave him page i have done everything i can for bran she said laying a wounded hand on his arm his life is in the hands of the gods and maester luwin as you reminded me yourself robb i have other children to think of now you will need a strong escort my lady theon said ill send hal with a squad of guardsmen robb said no catelyn said a large party attracts unwelcome attention i would not have the lannisters know i am coming ser rodrik protested my lady let me accompany you at least the kingsroad can be perilous for a woman alone i will not be taking the kingsroad catelyn replied she thought for a moment then nodded her consent two riders can move as fast as one and a good deal faster than a long column burdened by wagons and wheelhouses i will welcome your company ser rodrik we will follow the white knife down to the sea and hire a ship at white harbor strong horses and brisk winds should bring us to kings landing well ahead of ned and the lannisters and then she thought we shall see what we shall see sansa eddard stark had left before dawn septa mordane informed sansa as they broke their fast the king sent for him another hunt i do believe there are still wild aurochs in these lands i am told ive never seen an aurochs sansa said feeding a piece of bacon to lady under the table the direwolf took it from her hand as delicate as a queen septa mordane sniffed in disapproval a noble lady does not feed dogs at her table she said breaking off another piece of comb and letting the honey drip down onto her bread shes not a dog shes a direwolf sansa pointed out as lady licked her fingers with a rough tongue anyway father said we could keep them with us if we want the septa was not appeased youre a good girl sansa but i do vow when it comes to that creature youre as willful as your sister arya she scowled and where is arya this morning she wasnt hungry sansa said knowing full well that her sister had probably stolen down to the kitchen hours ago and wheedled a breakfast out of some cooks boy do remind her to dress nicely today the grey velvet perhaps we are all invited to ride with the queen and princess myrcella in the royal wheelhouse and we must look our best page sansa already looked her best she had brushed out her long auburn hair until it shone and picked her nicest blue silks she had been looking forward to today for more than a week it was a great honor to ride with the queen and besides prince joffrey might be there her betrothed just thinking it made her feel a strange fluttering inside even though they were not to marry for years and years sansa did not really know joffrey yet but she was already in love with him he was all she ever dreamt her prince should be tall and handsome and strong with hair like gold she treasured every chance to spend time with him few as they were the only thing that scared her about today was arya arya had a way of ruining everything you never knew what she would do ill tell her sansa said uncertainly but shell dress the way she always does she hoped it wouldnt be too embarrassing may i be excused you may septa mordane helped herself to more bread and honey and sansa slid from the bench lady followed at her heels as she ran from the inns common room outside she stood for a moment amidst the shouts and curses and the creak of wooden wheels as the men broke down the tents and pavilions and loaded the wagons for another days march the inn was a sprawling threestory structure of pale stone the biggest that sansa had ever seen but even so it had accommodations for less than a third of the kings party which had swollen to more than four hundred with the addition of her fathers household and the freeriders who had joined them on the road she found arya on the banks of the trident trying to hold nymeria still while she brushed dried mud from her fur the direwolf was not enjoying the process arya was wearing the same riding leathers she had worn yesterday and the day before you better put on something pretty sansa told her septa mordane said so were traveling in the queens wheelhouse with princess myrcella today im not arya said trying to brush a tangle out of nymerias matted grey fur mycah and i are going to ride upstream and look for rubies at the ford rubies sansa said lost what rubies arya gave her a look like she was so stupid rhaegars rubies this is where king robert killed him and won the crown sansa regarded her scrawny little sister in disbelief you cant look for rubies the princess is expecting us the queen invited us both i dont care arya said the wheelhouse doesnt even have windows you cant see a thing what could you want to see sansa said annoyed she had been thrilled by the invitation and her stupid sister was going to ruin everything just as shed feared its all just fields and farms and holdfasts it is not arya said stubbornly if you came with us sometimes youd see i hate riding sansa said fervently all it does is get you soiled and dusty and sore arya shrugged hold still she snapped at nymeria im not hurting you then to sansa she said when we were crossing the neck i counted thirtysix flowers i never saw before and mycah showed me a lizardlion page sansa shuddered they had been twelve days crossing the neck rumbling down a crooked causeway through an endless black bog and she had hated every moment of it the air had been damp and clammy the causeway so narrow they could not even make proper camp at night they had to stop right on the kingsroad dense thickets of halfdrowned trees pressed close around them branches dripping with curtains of pale fungus huge flowers bloomed in the mud and floated on pools of stagnant water but if you were stupid enough to leave the causeway to pluck them there were quicksands waiting to suck you down and snakes watching from the trees and lizardlions floating halfsubmerged in the water like black logs with eyes and teeth none of which stopped arya of course one day she came back grinning her horsey grin her hair all tangled and her clothes covered in mud clutching a raggedy bunch of purple and green flowers for father sansa kept hoping he would tell arya to behave herself and act like the highborn lady she was supposed to be but he never did he only hugged her and thanked her for the flowers that just made her worse then it turned out the purple flowers were called poison kisses and arya got a rash on her arms sansa would have thought that might have taught her a lesson but arya laughed about it and the next day she rubbed mud all over her arms like some ignorant bog woman just because her friend mycah told her it would stop the itching she had bruises on her arms and shoulders too dark purple welts and faded greenandyellow splotches sansa had seen them when her sister undressed for sleep how she had gotten those only the seven gods knew arya was still going on brushing out nymerias tangles and chattering about things shed seen on the trek south last week we found this haunted watchtower and the day before we chased a herd of wild horses you should have seen them run when they caught a scent of nymeria the wolf wriggled in her grasp and arya scolded her stop that i have to do the other side youre all muddy youre not supposed to leave the column sansa reminded her father said so arya shrugged i didnt go far anyway nymeria was with me the whole time i dont always go off either sometimes its fun just to ride along with the wagons and talk to people sansa knew all about the sorts of people arya liked to talk to squires and grooms and serving girls old men and naked children roughspoken freeriders of uncertain birth arya would make friends with anybody this mycah was the worst a butchers boy thirteen and wild he slept in the meat wagon and smelled of the slaughtering block just the sight of him was enough to make sansa feel sick but arya seemed to prefer his company to hers sansa was running out of patience now you have to come with me she told her sister firmly you cant refuse the queen septa mordane will expect you arya ignored her she gave a hard yank with the brush nymeria growled and spun away affronted come back here theres going to be lemon cakes and tea sansa went on all adult and reasonable lady brushed against her leg sansa scratched her ears the way she liked and lady sat beside her on her haunches page watching arya chase nymeria why would you want to ride a smelly old horse and get all sore and sweaty when you could recline on feather pillows and eat cakes with the queen i dont like the queen arya said casually sansa sucked in her breath shocked that even arya would say such a thing but her sister prattled on heedless she wont even let me bring nymeria she thrust the brush under her belt and stalked her wolf nymeria watched her approach warily a royal wheelhouse is no place for a wolf sansa said and princess myrcella is afraid of them you know that myrcella is a little baby arya grabbed nymeria around her neck but the moment she pulled out the brush again the direwolf wriggled free and bounded off frustrated arya threw down the brush bad wolf she shouted sansa couldnt help but smile a little the kennelmaster once told her that an animal takes after its master she gave lady a quick little hug lady licked her cheek sansa giggled arya heard and whirled around glaring i dont care what you say im going out riding her long horsey face got the stubborn look that meant she was going to do something willful gods be true arya sometimes you act like such a child sansa said ill go by myself then it will be ever so much nicer that way lady and i will eat all the lemon cakes and just have the best time without you she turned to walk off but arya shouted after her they wont let you bring lady either she was gone before sansa could think of a reply chasing nymeria along the river alone and humiliated sansa took the long way back to the inn where she knew septa mordane would be waiting lady padded quietly by her side she was almost in tears all she wanted was for things to be nice and pretty the way they were in the songs why couldnt arya be sweet and delicate and kind like princess myrcella she would have liked a sister like that sansa could never understand how two sisters born only two years apart could be so different it would have been easier if arya had been a bastard like their half brother jon she even looked like jon with the long face and brown hair of the starks and nothing of their lady mother in her face or her coloring and jons mother had been common or so people whispered once when she was littler sansa had even asked mother if perhaps there hadnt been some mistake perhaps the grumkins had stolen her real sister but mother had only laughed and said no arya was her daughter and sansas trueborn sister blood of their blood sansa could not think why mother would want to lie about it so she supposed it had to be true as she neared the center of camp her distress was quickly forgotten a crowd had gathered around the queens wheelhouse sansa heard excited voices buzzing like a hive of bees the doors had been thrown open she saw and the queen stood at the top of the wooden steps smiling down at someone she heard her saying the council does us great honor my good lords whats happening she asked a squire she knew the council sent riders from kings landing to escort us the rest of the way he told her an honor guard for the king page anxious to see sansa let lady clear a path through the crowd people moved aside hastily for the direwolf when she got closer she saw two knights kneeling before the queen in armor so fine and gorgeous that it made her blink one knight wore an intricate suit of white enameled scales brilliant as a field of newfallen snow with silver chasings and clasps that glittered in the sun when he removed his helm sansa saw that he was an old man with hair as pale as his armor yet he seemed strong and graceful for all that from his shoulders hung the pure white cloak of the kingsguard his companion was a man near twenty whose armor was steel plate of a deep forestgreen he was the handsomest man sansa had ever set eyes upon tall and powerfully made with jetblack hair that fell to his shoulders and framed a cleanshaven face and laughing green eyes to match his armor cradled under one arm was an antlered helm its magnificent rack shimmering in gold at first sansa did not notice the third stranger he did not kneel with the others he stood to one side beside their horses a gaunt grim man who watched the proceedings in silence his face was pockmarked and beardless with deepset eyes and hollow cheeks though he was not an old man only a few wisps of hair remained to him sprouting above his ears but those he had grown long as a womans his armor was irongrey chainmail over layers of boiled leather plain and unadorned and it spoke of age and hard use above his right shoulder the stained leather hilt of the blade strapped to his back was visible a twohanded greatsword too long to be worn at his side the king is gone hunting but i know he will be pleased to see you when he returns the queen was saying to the two knights who knelt before her but sansa could not take her eyes off the third man he seemed to feel the weight of her gaze slowly he turned his head lady growled a terror as overwhelming as anything sansa stark had ever felt filled her suddenly she stepped backward and bumped into someone strong hands grasped her by the shoulders and for a moment sansa thought it was her father but when she turned it was the burned face of sandor clegane looking down at her his mouth twisted in a terrible mockery of a smile you are shaking girl he said his voice rasping do i frighten you so much he did and had since she had first laid eyes on the ruin that fire had made of his face though it seemed to her now that he was not half so terrifying as the other still sansa wrenched away from him and the hound laughed and lady moved between them rumbling a warning sansa dropped to her knees to wrap her arms around the wolf they were all gathered around gaping she could feel their eyes on her and here and there she heard muttered comments and titters of laughter a wolf a man said and someone else said seven hells thats a direwolf and the first man said whats it doing in camp and the hounds rasping voice replied the starks use them for wet nurses and sansa realized that the two stranger knights were looking down on her and lady swords in their hands and then she was frightened again and ashamed tears filled her eyes page she heard the queen say joffrey go to her and her prince was there leave her alone joffrey said he stood over her beautiful in blue wool and black leather his golden curls shining in the sun like a crown he gave her his hand drew her to her feet what is it sweet lady why are you afraid no one will hurt you put away your swords all of you the wolf is her little pet thats all he looked at sandor clegane and you dog away with you youre scaring my betrothed the hound ever faithful bowed and slid away quietly through the press sansa struggled to steady herself she felt like such a fool she was a stark of winterfell a noble lady and someday she would be a queen it was not him my sweet prince she tried to explain it was the other one the two stranger knights exchanged a look payne chuckled the young man in the green armor the older man in white spoke to sansa gently ofttimes ser ilyn frightens me as well sweet lady he has a fearsome aspect as well he should the queen had descended from the wheelhouse the spectators parted to make way for her if the wicked do not fear the mngs justice you have put the wrong man in the office sansa finally found her words then surely you have chosen the right one your grace she said and a gale of laughter erupted all around her well spoken child said the old man in white as befits the daughter of eddard stark i am honored to know you however irregular the manner of our meeting i am ser barristan selmy of the kingsguard he bowed sansa knew the name and now the courtesies that septa mordane had taught her over the years came back to her the lord commander of the kingsguard she said and councillor to robert our king and to aerys targaryen before him the honor is mine good knight even in the far north the singers praise the deeds of barristan the bold the green knight laughed again barristan the old you mean dont flatter him too sweetly child he thinks overmuch of himself already he smiled at her now wolf girl if you can put a name to me as well then i must concede that you are truly our hands daughter joffrey stiffened beside her have a care how you address my betrothed can answer sansa said quickly to quell her princes anger she smiled at the green knight your helmet bears golden antlers my lord the stag is the sigil of the royal house king robert has two brothers by your extreme youth you can only be renly baratheon lord of storms end and councillor to the king and so i name you ser barristan chuckled by his extreme youth he can only be a prancing jackanapes and so i name him there was general laughter led by lord renly himself the tension of a few moments ago was gone and sansa was beginning to feel comfortable until ser ilyn payne shouldered two men aside and page stood before her unsmiling he did not say a word lady bared her teeth and began to growl a low rumble full of menace but this time sansa silenced the wolf with a gentle hand to the head i am sorry if i offended you ser ilyn she said she waited for an answer but none came as the headsman looked at her his pale colorless eyes seemed to strip the clothes away from her and then the skin leaving her soul naked before him still silent he turned and walked away sansa did not understand she looked at her prince did i say something wrong your grace why will he not speak to me ser ilyn has not been feeling talkative these past fourteen years lord renly commented with a sly smile joffrey gave his uncle a look of pure loathing then took sansas hands in his own aerys targaryen had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers he speaks most eloquently with his sword however the queen said and his devotion to our realm is unquestioned then she smiled graciously and said sansa the good councillors and i must speak together until the king returns with your father i fear we shall have to postpone your day with myrcella please give your sweet sister my apologies joffrey perhaps you would be so kind as to entertain our guest today it would be my pleasure mother joffrey said very formally he took her by the arm and led her away from the wheelhouse and sansas spirits took flight a whole day with her prince she gazed at joffrey worshipfully he was so gallant she thought the way he had rescued her from ser ilyn and the hound why it was almost like the songs like the time serwyn of the mirror shield saved the princess daeryssa from the giants or prince aemon the dragonknight championing queen naeryss honor against evil ser morgils slanders the touch of joffreys hand on her sleeve made her heart beat faster what would you like to do be with you sansa thought but she said whatever youd like to do my prince jofftey reflected a moment we could go riding oh i love riding sansa said joffrey glanced back at lady who was following at their heels your wolf is liable to frighten the horses and my dog seems to frighten you let us leave them both behind and set off on our own what do you say sansa hesitated if you like she said uncertainly i suppose i could tie lady up she did not quite understand though i didnt know you had a dog joffrey laughed hes my mothers dog in truth she has set him to guard me and so he does you mean the hound she said she wanted to hit herself for being so slow her prince would never love her if she seemed stupid is it safe to leave him behind page prince joffrey looked annoyed that she would even ask have no fear lady i am almost a man grown and i dont fight with wood like your brothers all i need is this he drew his sword and showed it to her a longsword adroitly shrunken to suit a boy of twelve gleaming blue steel castleforged and doubleedged with a leather grip and a lionshead pommel in gold sansa exclaimed over it admiringly and joffrey looked pleased i call it lions tooth he said and so they left her direwolf and his bodyguard behind them while they ranged east along the north bank of the trident with no company save lions tooth it was a glorious day a magical day the air was warm and heavy with the scent of flowers and the woods here had a gentle beauty that sansa had never seen in the north prince joffreys mount was a blood bay courser swift as the wind and he rode it with reckless abandon so fast that sansa was hardpressed to keep up on her mare it was a day for adventures they explored the caves by the riverbank and tracked a shadowcat to its lair and when they grew hungry joffrey found a holdfast by its smoke and told them to fetch food and wine for their prince and his lady they dined on trout fresh from the river and sansa drank more wine than she had ever drunk before my father only lets us have one cup and only at feasts she confessed to her prince my betrothed can drink as much as she wants joffrey said refilling her cup they went more slowly after they had eaten joffrey sang for her as they rode his voice high and sweet and pure sansa was a little dizzy from the wine shouldnt we be starting back she asked soon joffrey said the battleground is right up ahead where the river bends that was where my father killed rhaegar targaryen you know he smashed in his chest crunch right through the armor joffrey swung an imaginary warhammer to show her how it was done then my uncle jaime killed old aerys and my father was king whats that sound sansa heard it too floating through the woods a kind of wooden clattering snack snack snack i dont know she said it made her nervous though joffrey lets go back i want to see what it is joffrey turned his horse in the direction of the sounds and sansa had no choice but to follow the noises grew louder and more distinct the clack of wood on wood and as they grew closer they heard heavy breathing as well and now and then a grunt someones there sansa said anxiously she found herself thinking of lady wishing the direwolf was with her youre safe with me joffrey drew his lions tooth from its sheath the sound of steel on leather made her tremble this way he said riding through a stand of trees beyond in a clearing overlooking the river they came upon a boy and a girl playing at knights their swords were wooden sticks broom handles from the look of them and they were rushing across the grass swinging at each other lustily the boy was years older a head taller and much stronger and he was pressing the attack the girl a scrawny thing in soiled leathers was dodging and managing to get her stick in the way of most of the boys blows but not all when she tried to lunge at him he caught her page stick with his own swept it aside and slid his wood down hard on her fingers she cried out and lost her weapon prince joffrey laughed the boy looked around wideeyed and startled and dropped his stick in the grass the girl glared at them sucking on her knuckles to take the sting out and sansa was horrified arya she called out incredulously go away arya shouted back at them angry tears in her eyes what are you doing here leave us alone joffrey glanced from arya to sansa and back again your sister she nodded blushing joffrey examined the boy an ungainly lad with a coarse freckled face and thick red hair and who are you boy he asked in a commanding tone that took no notice of the fact that the other was a year his senior mycah the boy muttered he recognized the prince and averted his eyes miord hes the butchers boy sansa said hes my friend arya said sharply you leave him alone a butchers boy who wants to be a knight is it joffrey swung down from his mount sword in hand pick up your sword butchers boy he said his eyes bright with amusement let us see how good you are mycah stood there frozen with fear joffrey walked toward him go on pick it up or do you only fight little girls she ast me to mlord mycah said she ast me to sansa had only to glance at arya and see the flush on her sisters face to know the boy was telling the truth but joffrey was in no mood to listen the wine had made him wild are you going to pick up your sword mycah shook his head its only a stick mlord its not no sword its only a stick and youre only a butchers boy and no knight joffrey lifted lions tooth and laid its point on mycahs cheek below the eye as the butchers boy stood trembling that was my ladys sister you were hitting do you know that a bright bud of blood blossomed where his sword pressed into mycahs flesh and a slow red line trickled down the boys cheek stop it arya screamed she grabbed up her fallen stick sansa was afraid arya you stay out of this i wont hurt him much prince joffrey told arya never taking his eyes off the butchers boy arya went for him page sansa slid off her mare but she was too slow arya swung with both hands there was a loud crack as the wood split against the back of the princes head and then everything happened at once before sansas horrified eyes joffrey staggered and whirled around roaring curses mycah ran for the trees as fast as his legs would take him arya swung at the prince again but this time joffrey caught the blow on lions tooth and sent her broken stick flying from her hands the back of his head was all bloody and his eyes were on fire sansa was shrieking no no stop it stop it both of you youre spoiling it but no one was listening arya scooped up a rock and hurled it at joffreys head she hit his horse instead and the blood bay reared and went galloping off after mycah stop it dont stop it sansa screamed joffrey slashed at arya with his sword screaming obscenities terrible words filthy words arya darted back frightened now but joffrey followed hounding her toward the woods backing her up against a tree sansa didnt know what to do she watched helplessly almost blind from her tears then a grey blur flashed past her and suddenly nymeria was there leaping jaws closing around joffteys sword arm the steel fell from his fingers as the wolf knocked him off his feet and they rolled in the grass the wolf snarling and ripping at him the prince shrieking in pain get it off he screamed get it off aryas voice cracked like a whip nymefia the direwolf let go of joffrey and moved to aryas side the prince lay in the grass whimpering cradling his mangled arm his shirt was soaked in blood arya said she didnt hurt you much she picked up lions tooth where it had fallen and stood over him holding the sword with both hands jofftey made a scared whimpery sound as he looked up at her no he said dont hurt me ill tell my mother you leave him alone sansa screamed at her sister arya whirled and heaved the sword into the air putting her whole body into the throw the blue steel flashed in the sun as the sword spun out over the river it hit the water and vanished with a splash joffrey moaned arya ran off to her horse nymeria loping at her heels after they had gone sansa went to prince joffrey his eyes were closed in pain his breath ragged sansa knelt beside him joffrey she sobbed oh look what they did look what they did my poor prince dont be afraid ill ride to the holdfast and bring help for you tenderly she reached out and brushed back his soft blond hair his eyes snapped open and looked at her and there was nothing but loathing there nothing but the vilest contempt then go he spit at her and dont touch me eddard theyve found her my lord ned rose quickly our men or lannisters page tit was jory his steward vayon poole replied shes not been harmed thank the gods ned said his men had been searching for arya for four days now but the queens men had been out hunting as well where is she tell jory to bring her here at once i am sorry my lord poole told him the guards on the gate were lannister men and they informed the queen when jory brought her in shes being taken directly before the king damn that woman ned said striding to the door find sansa and bring her to the audience chamber her voice may be needed he descended the tower steps in a red rage he had led searches himself for the first three days and had scarcely slept an hour since arya had disappeared this morning he had been so heartsick and weary he could scarcely stand but now his fury was on him filling him with strength men called out to him as he crossed the castle yard but ned ignored them in his haste he would have run but he was still the kings hand and a hand must keep his dignity he was aware of the eyes that followed him of the muttered voices wondering what he would do the castle was a modest holding a half days ride south of the trident the royal party had made themselves the uninvited guests of its lord ser raymun darry while the hunt for arya and the butchers boy was conducted on both sides of the river they were not welcome visitors ser raymun lived under the kings peace but his family had fought beneath rhaegars dragon banners at the trident and his three older brothers had died there a truth neither robert nor ser raymun had forgotten with kings men darry men lannister men and stark men all crammed into a castle far too small for them tensions burned hot and heavy the king had appropriated ser raymuns audience chamber and that was where ned found them the room was crowded when he burst in too crowded he thought left alone he and robert might have been able to settle the matter amicably robert was slumped in darrys high seat at the far end of the room his face closed and sullen cersei lannister and her son stood beside him the queen had her hand on joffreys shoulder thick silken bandages still covered the boys arm arya stood in the center of the room alone but for jory cassel every eye upon her arya ned called loudly he went to her his boots ringing on the stone floor when she saw him she cried out and began to sob ned went to one knee and took her in his arms she was shaking im sorry she sobbed im sorry im sorry i know he said she felt so tiny in his arms nothing but a scrawny little girl it was hard to see how she had caused so much trouble are you hurt no her face was dirty and her tears left pink tracks down her cheeks hungry some i ate some berries but there was nothing else well feed you soon enough ned promised he rose to face the king what is the meaning of this page his eyes swept the room searching for friendly faces but for his own men they were few enough ser raymun darry guarded his look well lord renly wore a half smile that might mean anything and old ser barristan was grave the rest were lannister men and hostile their only good fortune was that both jaime lannister and sandor clegane were missing leading searches north of the trident why was i not told that my daughter had been found ned demanded his voice ringing why was she not brought to me at once he spoke to robert but it was cersei lannister who answered how dare you speak to your king in that manner at that the king stirred quiet woman he snapped he straightened in his seat i am sorry ned i never meant to frighten the girl it seemed best to bring her here and get the business done with quickly and what business is that ned put ice in his voice the queen stepped forward you know full well stark this girl of yours attacked my son her and her butchers boy that animal of hers tried to tear his arm off thats not true arya said loudly she just bit him a little he was hurting mycah joff told us what happened the queen said you and the butcher boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him thats not how it was arya said close to tears again ned put a hand on her shoulder yes it is prince joffrey insisted they all attacked me and she threw lions tooth in the river ned noticed that he did not so much as glance at arya as he spoke liar arya yelled shut up the prince yelled back enough the king roared rising from his seat his voice thick with irritation silence fell he glowered at arya through his thick beard now child you will tell me what happened tell it all and tell it true it is a great crime to lie to a king then he looked over at his son when she is done you will have your turn until then hold your tongue as arya began her story ned heard the door open behind him he glanced back and saw vayon poole enter with sansa they stood quietly at the back of the hall as arya spoke when she got to the part where she threw joffreys sword into the middle of the trident renly baratheon began to laugh the king bristled ser barristan escort my brother from the hall before he chokes lord renly stifled his laughter my brother is too kind i can find the door myself he bowed to joffrey perchance later youll tell me how a nineyearold girl the size of a wet rat managed to disarm you with a broom handle and throw your sword in the river as the door swung shut behind him ned heard him say lions tooth and guffaw once more page prince joffrey was pale as he began his very different version of events when his son was done talking the king rose heavily from his seat looking like a man who wanted to be anywhere but here what in all the seven hells am i supposed to make of this he says one thing she says another they were not the only ones present ned said sansa come here ned had heard her version of the story the night arya had vanished he knew the truth tell us what happened his eldest daughter stepped forward hesitantly she was dressed in blue velvets trimmed with white a silver chain around her neck her thick auburn hair had been brushed until it shone she blinked at her sister then at the young prince i dont know she said tearfully looking as though she wanted to bolt i dont remember everything happened so fast i didnt see you rotten arya shrieked she flew at her sister like an arrow knocking sansa down to the ground pummeling her liar liar liar liar arya stop it ned shouted jory pulled her off her sister kicking sansa was pale and shaking as ned lifted her back to her feet are you hurt he asked but she was staring at arya and she did not seem to hear the girl is as wild as that filthy animal of hers cersei lannister said robert i want her punished seven hells robert swore cersei look at her shes a child what would you have me do whip her through the streets damn it children fight its over no lasting harm was done the queen was furious joff will carry those scars for the rest of his life robert baratheon looked at his eldest son so he will perhaps they will teach him a lesson ned see that your daughter is disciplined i will do the same with my son gladly your grace ned said with vast relief robert started to walk away but the queen was not done and what of the direwolf she called after him what of the beast that savaged your son the king stopped turned back frowned id forgotten about the damned wolf ned could see arya tense in jorys arms jory spoke up quickly we found no trace of the direwolf your grace robert did not look unhappy no so be it the queen raised her voice a hundred golden dragons to the man who brings me its skin a costly pelt robert grumbled i want no part of this woman you can damn well buy your furs with lannister gold the queen regarded him coolly i had not thought you so niggardly the king id thought to wed would page have laid a wolfskin across my bed before the sun went down roberts face darkened with anger that would be a fine trick without a wolf we have a wolf cersei lannister said her voice was very quiet but her green eyes shone with triumph it took them all a moment to comprehend her words but when they did the king shrugged irritably as you will have ser ilyn see to it robert you cannot mean this ned protested the king was in no mood for more argument enough ned i will hear no more a direwolf is a savage beast sooner or later it would have turned on your girl the same way the other did on my son get her a dog shell be happier for it that was when sansa finally seemed to comprehend her eyes were frightened as they went to her father he doesnt mean lady does he she saw the truth on his face no she said no not lady lady didnt bite anybody shes good lady wasnt there arya shouted angrily you leave her alone stop them sansa pleaded dont let them do it please please it wasnt lady it was nymeria arya did it you cant it wasnt lady dont let them hurt lady ill make her be good i promise i promise she started to cry all ned could do was take her in his arms and hold her while she wept he looked across the room at robert his old friend closer than any brother please robert for the love you bear me for the love you bore my sister please the king looked at them for a long moment then turned his eyes on his wife damn you cersei he said with loathing ned stood gently disengaging himself from sansas grasp all the weariness of the past four days had returned to him do it yourself then robert he said in a voice cold and sharp as steel at least have the courage to do it yourself robert looked at ned with flat dead eyes and left without a word his footsteps heavy as lead silence filled the hall where is the direwolf cersei lannister asked when her husband was gone beside her prince joffrey was smiling the beast is chained up outside the gatehouse your grace ser barristan selmy answered reluctantly send for ilyn payne no ned said jory take the girls back to their rooms and bring me ice the words tasted of bile in his throat but he forced them out if it must be done i will do it page cersei lannister regarded him suspiciously you stark is this some trick why would you do such a thing they were all staring at him but it was sansas look that cut she is of the north she deserves better than a butcher he left the room with his eyes burning and his daughters wails echoing in his ears and found the direwolf pup where they chained her ned sat beside her for a while lady he said tasting the name he had never paid much attention to the names the children had picked but looking at her now he knew that sansa had chosen well she was the smallest of the litter the prettiest the most gentle and trusting she looked at him with bright golden eyes and he ruffled her thick grey fur shortly jory brought him ice when it was over he said choose four men and have them take the body north bury her at winterfell all that way jory said astonished all that way ned affirmed the lannister woman shall never have this skin he was walking back to the tower to give himself up to sleep at last when sandor clegane and his riders came pounding through the castle gate back from their hunt there was something slung over the back of his destrier a heavy shape wrapped in a bloody cloak no sign of your daughter hand the hound rasped down but the day was not wholly wasted we got her little pet he reached back and shoved the burden off and it fell with a thump in front of ned bending ned pulled back the cloak dreading the words he would have to find for arya but it was not nymeria after all it was the butchers boy mycah his body covered in dried blood he had been cut almost in half from shoulder to waist by some terrible blow struck from above you rode him down ned said the hounds eyes seemed to glitter through the steel of that hideous dogshead helm he ran he looked at neds face and laughed but not very fast bran it seemed as though he had been falling for years fly a voice whispered in the darkness but bran did not know thow to fly so all he could do was fall maester luwin made a little boy of clay baked him till he was hard and brittle dressed him in brans clothes and flung him off a roof bran remembered the way he shattered but i never fall he said falling page the ground was so far below him he could barely make it out through the grey mists that whirled around him but he could feel how fast he was falling and he knew what was waiting for him down there even in dreams you could not fall forever he would wake up in the instant before he hit the ground he knew you always woke up in the instant before you hit the ground and if you dont the voice asked the ground was closer now still far far away a thousand miles away but closer than it had been it was cold here in the darkness there was no sun no stars only the ground below coming up to smash him and the grey mists and the whispering voice he wanted to cry not cry fly i cant fly bran said i cant i cant how do you know have you ever tried the voice was high and thin bran looked around to see where it was coming from a crow was spiraling down with him just out of reach following him as he fell help me he said im trying the crow replied say got any corn bran reached into his pocket as the darkness spun dizzily around him when he pulled his hand out golden kernels slid from between his fingers into the air they fell with him the crow landed on his hand and began to eat are you really a crow bran asked are you really falling the crow asked back its just a dream bran said is it asked the crow ill wake up when i hit the ground bran told the bird youll die when you hit the ground the crow said it went back to eating corn bran looked down he could see mountains now their peaks white with snow and the silver thread of rivers in dark woods he closed his eyes and began to cry that wont do any good the crow said i told you the answer is flying not crying how hard can it be im doing it the crow took to the air and flapped around brans hand you have wings bran pointed out page maybe you do too bran felt along his shoulders groping for feathers there are different kinds of wings the crow said bran was staring at his arms his legs he was so skinny just skin stretched taut over bones had he always been so thin he tried to remember a face swam up at him out of the grey mist shining with light golden the things i do for love it said bran screamed the crow took to the air cawing not that it shrieked at him forget that you do not need it now put it aside put it away it landed on brans shoulder and pecked at him and the shining golden face was gone bran was falling faster than ever the grey mists howled around him as he plunged toward the earth below what are you doing to me he asked the crow tearful teaching you how to fly i cant fly youre flying tight now fm falling every flight begins with a fall the crow said look down im afraid lookdown bran looked down and felt his insides turn to water the ground was rushing up at him now the whole world was spread out below him a tapestry of white and brown and green he could see everything so clearly that for a moment he forgot to be afraid he could see the whole realm and everyone in it he saw winterfell as the eagles see it the tall towers looking squat and stubby from above the castle walls just lines in the dirt he saw maester luwin on his balcony studying the sky through a polished bronze tube and frowning as he made notes in a book he saw his brother robb taller and stronger than he remembered him practicing swordplay in the yard with real steel in his hand he saw hodor the simple giant from the stables carrying an anvil to mikkens forge hefting it onto his shoulder as easily as another man might heft a bale of hay at the heart of the godswood the great white weirwood brooded over its reflection in the black pool its leaves rustling in a chill wind when it felt bran watching it lifted its eyes from the still waters and stared back at him knowingly he looked east and saw a galley racing across the waters of the bite he saw his mother sitting alone in a cabin looking at a bloodstained knife on a table in front of her as the rowers pulled at their oars and page ser rodrik leaned across a rail shaking and heaving a storm was gathering ahead of them a vast dark roaring lashed by lightning but somehow they could not see it he looked south and saw the great bluegreen rush of the trident he saw his father pleading with the king his face etched with grief he saw sansa crying herself to sleep at night and he saw arya watching in silence and holding her secrets hard in her heart there were shadows all around them one shadow was dark as ash with the terrible face of a hound another was armored like the sun golden and beautiful over them both loomed a giant in armor made of stone but when he opened his visor there was nothing inside but darkness and thick black blood he lifted his eyes and saw clear across the narrow sea to the free cities and the green dothraki sea and beyond to vaes dothrak under its mountain to the fabled lands of the jade sea to asshai by the shadow where dragons stirred beneath the sunrise finally he looked north he saw the wall shining like blue crystal and his bastard brother jon sleeping alone in a cold bed his skin growing pale and hard as the memory of all warmth fled from him and he looked past the wall past endless forests cloaked in snow past the frozen shore and the great bluewhite rivers of ice and the dead plains where nothing grew or lived north and north and north he looked to the curtain of light at the end of the world and then beyond that curtain he looked deep into the heart of winter and then he cried out afraid and the heat of his tears burned on his cheeks now you know the crow whispered as it sat on his shoulder now you know why you must live why bran said not understanding falling falling because winter is coming bran looked at the crow on his shoulder and the crow looked back it had three eyes and the third eye was full of a terrible knowledge bran looked down there was nothing below him now but snow and cold and death a frozen wasteland where jagged bluewhite spires of ice waited to embrace him they flew up at him like spears he saw the bones of a thousand other dreamers impaled upon their points he was desperately afraid can a man still be brave if hes afraid he heard his own voice saying small and far away and his fathers voice replied to him that is the only time a man can be brave now bran the crow urged choose fly or die death reached for him screaming bran spread his arms and flew wings unseen drank the wind and filled and pulled him upward the terrible needles of ice receded below him the sky opened up above bran soared it was better than climbing it was better than anything the world grew small beneath him im flying he cried out in delight page ive noticed said the threeeyed crow it took to the air flapping its wings in his face slowing him blinding him he faltered in the air as its pinions beat against his cheeks its beak stabbed at him fiercely and bran felt a sudden blinding pain in the middle of his forehead between his eyes what are you doing he shrieked the crow opened its beak and cawed at him a shrill scream of fear and the grey mists shuddered and swirled around him and ripped away like a veil and he saw that the crow was really a woman a serving woman with long black hair and he knew her from somewhere from winterfell yes that was it he remembered her now and then he realized that he was in winterfell in a bed high in some chilly tower room and the blackhaired woman dropped a basin of water to shatter on the floor and ran down the steps shouting hes awake hes awake hes awake bran touched his forehead between his eyes the place where the crow had pecked him was still burning but there was nothing there no blood no wound he felt weak and dizzy he tried to get out of bed but nothing happened and then there was movement beside the bed and something landed lightly on his legs he felt nothing a pair of yellow eyes looked into his own shining like the sun the window was open and it was cold in the room but the warmth that came off the wolf enfolded him like a hot bath his pup bran realized or was it he was so big now he reached out to pet him his hand trembling like a leaf when his brother robb burst into the room breathless from his dash up the tower steps the direwolf was licking brans face bran looked up calmly his name is summer he said catelyn we will make kings landing within the hour catelyn turned away from the rail and forced herself to smile your oarmen have done well by us captain each one of them shall have a silver stag as a token of my gratitude captain moreo turnitis favored her with a half bow you are far too generous lady stark the honor of carrying a great lady like yourself is all the reward they need but theyll take the silver anyway moreo smiled as you say he spoke the common tongue fluently with only the slightest hint of a tyroshi accent hed been plying the narrow sea for thirty years hed told her as oarman quartermaster and finally captain of his own trading galleys the stonn dancer was his fourth ship and his fastest a twomasted galley of sixty oars she had certainly been the fastest of the ships available in white harbor when catelyn and ser rodrik page cassel had arrived after their headlong gallop downriver the tyroshi were notorious for their avarice and ser rodrik had argued for hiring a fishing sloop out of the three sisters but catelyn had insisted on the galley it was good that she had the winds had been against them much of the voyage and without the galleys oars theyd still be beating their way past the fingers instead of skimming toward kings landing and journeys end so close she thought beneath the linen bandages her fingers still throbbed where the dagger had bitten the pain was her scourge catelyn felt lest she forget she could not bend the last two fingers on her left hand and the others would never again be dexterous yet that was a small enough price to pay for brans life ser rodrik chose that moment to appear on deck my good friend said moreo through his forked green beard the tyroshi loved bright colors even in their facial hair it is so fine to see you looking better yes ser rodrik agreed i havent wanted to die for almost two days now he bowed to catelyn my lady he was looking better a shade thinner than he had been when they set out from white harbor but almost himself again the strong winds in the bite and the roughness of the narrow sea had not agreed with him and hed almost gone over the side when the storm seized them unexpectedly off dragonstone yet somehow he had clung to a rope until three of moreos men could rescue him and carry him safely below decks the captain was just telling me that our voyage is almost at an end she said ser rodrik managed a wry smile so soon he looked odd without his great white side whiskers smaller somehow less fierce and ten years older yet back on the bite it had seemed prudent to submit to a crewmans razor after his whiskers had become hopelessly befouled for the third time while he leaned over the rail and retched into the swirling winds i will leave you to discuss your business captain moreo said he bowed and took his leave of them the galley skimmed the water like a dragonfly her oars rising and falling in perfect time ser rodrik held the rail and looked out over the passing shore i have not been the most valiant of protectors catelyn touched his arm we are here ser rodrik and safely that is all that truly matters her hand groped beneath her cloak her fingers stiff and fumbling the dagger was still at her side she found she had to touch it now and then to reassure herself now we must reach the kings masteratarms and pray that he can be trusted ser aron santagar is a vain man but an honest one ser rodriks hand went to his face to stroke his whiskers and discovered once again that they were gone he looked nonplussed he may know the blade yes but my lady the moment we go ashore we are at risk and there are those at court who will page know you on sight catelyns mouth grew tight littlefinger she murmured his face swam up before her a boys face though he was a boy no longer his father had died several years before so he was lord baelish now yet still they called him littlefinger her brother edmure had given him that name long ago at riverrun his familys modest holdings were on the smallest of the fingers and petyr had been slight and short for his age ser rodrik cleared his throat lord baelish once ah his thought trailed off uncertainly in search of the polite word catelyn was past delicacy he was my fathers ward we grew up together in riverrun i thought of him as a brother but his feelings for me were more than brotherly when it was announced that i was to wed brandon stark petyr challenged for the right to my hand it was madness brandon was twenty petyr scarcely fifteen i had to beg brandon to spare petyrs life he let him off with a scar afterward my father sent him away i have not seen him since she lifted her face to the spray as if the brisk wind could blow the memories away he wrote to me at riverrun after brandon was killed but i burned the letter unread by then i knew that ned would marry me in his brothers place ser rodriks fingers fumbled once again for nonexistent whiskers littlefinger sits on the small council now i knew he would rise high catelyn said he was always clever even as a boy but it is one thing to be clever and another to be wise i wonder what the years have done to him high overhead the fareyes sang out from the rigging captain moreo came scrambling across the deck giving orders and all around them the stonn dancer burst into frenetic activity as kings landing slid into view atop its three high hills three hundred years ago catelyn knew those heights had been covered with forest and only a handful of fisherfolk had lived on the north shore of the blackwater rush where that deep swift river flowed into the sea then aegon the conqueror had sailed from dragonstone it was here that his army had put ashore and there on the highest hill that he built his first crude redoubt of wood and earth now the city covered the shore as far as catelyn could see manses and arbors and granaries brick storehouses and timbered inns and merchants stalls taverns and graveyards and brothels all piled one on another she could hear the clamor of the fish market even at this distance between the buildings were broad roads lined with trees wandering crookback streets and alleys so narrow that two men could not walk abreast visenyas hill was crowned by the great sept of baelor with its seven crystal towers across the city on the hill of rhaenys stood the blackened walls of the dragonpit its huge dome collapsing into ruin its bronze doors closed now for a century the street of the sisters ran between them straight as an arrow the city walls rose in the distance high and strong a hundred quays lined the waterfront and the harbor was crowded with ships deepwater fishing boats and river runners came and went ferrymen poled back and forth across the blackwater rush trading galleys unloaded goods from braavos and pentos and lys catelyn spied the queens ornate barge tied page up beside a fatbellied whaler from the port of ibben its hull black with tar while upriver a dozen lean golden warships rested in their cribs sails furled and cruel iron rams lapping at the water and above it all frowning down from aegons high hill was the red keep seven huge drumtowers crowned with iron ramparts an immense grim barbican vaulted halls and covered bridges barracks and dungeons and granaries massive curtain walls studded with archers nests all fashioned of pale red stone aegon the conqueror had commanded it built his son maegor the cruel had seen it completed afterward he had taken the heads of every stonemason woodworker and builder who had labored on it only the blood of the dragon would ever know the secrets of the fortress the dragonlords had built he vowed yet now the banners that flew from its battlements were golden not black and where the threeheaded dragon had once breathed fire now pranced the crowned stag of house baratheon a highmasted swan ship from the summer isles was beating out from port its white sails huge with wind the stonn dancer moved past it pulling steadily for shore my lady ser rodrik said i have thought on how best to proceed while i lay abed you must not enter the castle i will go in your stead and bring ser aron to you in some safe place she studied the old knight as the galley drew near to a pier moreo was shouting in the vulgar valyrian of the free cities you would be as much at risk as i would ser rodrik smiled i think not i looked at my reflection in the water earlier and scarcely recognized myself my mother was the last person to see me without whiskers and she is forty years dead i believe i am safe enough my lady moreo bellowed a command as one sixty oars lifted from the river then reversed and backed water the galley slowed another shout the oars slid back inside the hull as they thumped against the dock tyroshi seamen leapt down to tie up moreo came bustling up all smiles kings landing my lady as you did command and never has a ship made a swifter or surer passage will you be needing assistance to carry your things to the castle we shall not be going to the castle perhaps you can suggest an inn someplace clean and comfortable and not too far from the river the tyroshi fingered his forked green beard just so i know of several establishments that might suit your needs yet first if i may be so bold there is the matter of the second half of the payment we agreed upon and of course the extra silver you were so kind as to promise sixty stags i believe it was for the oarmen catelyn reminded him oh of a certainty said moreo though perhaps i should hold it for them until we return to tyrosh for the sake of their wives and children if you give them the silver here my lady they will dice it away or spend it all for a nights pleasure there are worse things to spend money on ser rodrik put in winter is coming page a man must make his own choices catelyn said they earned the silver how they spend it is no concern of mine as you say my lady moreo replied bowing and smiling just to be sure catelyn paid the oarmen herself a stag to each man and a copper to the two men who carried their chests halfway up visenyas hill to the inn that moreo had suggested it was a rambling old place on eel alley the woman who owned it was a sour crone with a wandering eye who looked them over suspiciously and bit the coin that catelyn offered her to make sure it was real her rooms were large and airy though and moreo swore that her fish stew was the most savory in all the seven kingdoms best of all she had no interest in their names i think it best if you stay away from the common room ser rodrik said after they had settled in even in a place like this one never knows who may be watching he wore ringmail dagger and longsword under a dark cloak with a hood he could pull up over his head i will be back before nightfall with ser aron he promised rest now my lady catelyn was tired the voyage had been long and fatiguing and she was no longer as young as she had been her windows opened on the alley and rooftops with a view of the blackwater beyond she watched ser rodrik set off striding briskly through the busy streets until he was lost in the crowds then decided to take his advice the bedding was stuffed with straw instead of feathers but she had no trouble falling asleep she woke to a pounding on her door catelyn sat up sharply outside the window the rooftops of kings landing were red in the light of the setting sun she had slept longer than she intended a fist hammered at her door again and a voice called out open in the name of the king a moment she called out she wrapped herself in her cloak the dagger was on the bedside table she snatched it up before she unlatched the heavy wooden door the men who pushed into the room wore the black ringmail and golden cloaks of the city watch their leader smiled at the dagger in her hand and said no need for that mady were to escort you to the castle by whose authority she said he showed her a ribbon catelyn felt her breath catch in her throat the seal was a mockingbird in grey wax petyr she said so soon something must have happened to ser rodrik she looked at the head guardsman do you know who i am no mlady he said mlord littlefinger said only to bring you to him and see that you were not mistreated catelyn nodded you may wait outside while i dress she bathed her hands in the basin and wrapped them in clean linen her fingers were thick and awkward page as she struggled to lace up her bodice and knot a drab brown cloak about her neck how could littlefinger have known she was here ser rodrik would never have told him old he might be but he was stubborn and loyal to a fault were they too late had the lannisters reached kings landing before her no if that were true ned would be here too and surely he would have come to her how then she thought moreo the tyroshi knew who they were and where they were damn him she hoped hed gotten a good price for the information they had brought a horse for her the lamps were being lit along the streets as they set out and catelyn felt the eyes of the city on her as she rode surrounded by the guard in their golden cloaks when they reached the red keep the portcullis was down and the great gates sealed for the night but the castle windows were alive with flickering lights the guardsmen left their mounts outside the walls and escorted her through a narrow postern door then up endless steps to a tower he was alone in the room seated at a heavy wooden table an oil lamp beside him as he wrote when they ushered her inside he set down his pen and looked at her cat he said quietly why have i been brought here in this fashion he rose and gestured brusquely to the guards leave us the men departed you were not mistreated i trust he said after they had gone i gave firm instructions he noticed her bandages your hands catelyn ignored the implied question i am not accustomed to being summoned like a serving wench she said icily as a boy you still knew the meaning of courtesy ive angered you my lady that was never my intent he looked contrite the look brought back vivid memories for catelyn he had been a sly child but after his mischiefs he always looked contrite it was a gift he had the years had not changed him much petyr had been a small boy and he had grown into a small man an inch or two shorter than catelyn slender and quick with the sharp features she remembered and the same laughing greygreen eyes he had a little pointed chin beard now and threads of silver in his dark hair though he was still shy of thirty they went well with the silver mockingbird that fastened his cloak even as a child he had always loved his silver how did you know i was in the city she asked him lord varys knows all petyr said with a sly smile he will be joining us shortly but i wanted to see you alone first it has been too long cat how many years catelyn ignored his familiarity there were more important questions so it was the kings spider who found me littlefinger winced you dont want to call him that hes very sensitive comes of being an eunuch i imagine nothing happens in this city without varys knowing oftimes he knows about it before it happens he has informants everywhere his little birds he calls them one of his little birds heard about your visit thankfully varys came to me first page why you he shrugged why not me i am master of coin the kings own councillor selmy and lord renly rode north to meet robert and lord stannis is gone to dragonstone leaving only maester pycelle and me i was the obvious choice i was ever a friend to your sister lysa varys knows that does varys know about lord varys knows everything except why you are here he lifted an eyebrow why are you here a wife is allowed to yearn for her husband and if a mother needs her daughters close who can tell her no littlefinger laughed oh very good my lady but please dont expect me to believe that i know you too well what were the tully words again her throat was dry family duty honor she recited stiffly he did know her too well family duty honor he echoed all of which required you to remain in winterfell where our hand left you no my lady something has happened this sudden trip of yours bespeaks a certain urgency i beg of you let me help old sweet friends should never hesitate to rely upon each other there was a soft knock on the door enter littlefinger called out the man who stepped through the door was plump perfumed powdered and as hairless as an egg he wore a vest of woven gold thread over a loose gown of purple silk and on his feet were pointed slippers of soft velvet lady stark he said taking her hand in both of his to see you again after so many years is such a joy his flesh was soft and moist and his breath smelled of lilacs oh your poor hands have you burned yourself sweet lady the fingers are so delicate our good maester pycelle makes a marvelous salve shall i send for a jar catelyn slid her fingers from his grasp i thank you my lord but my own maester luwin has already seen to my hurts varys bobbed his head i was grievous sad to hear about your son and him so young the gods are cruel on that we agree lord varys she said the title was but a courtesy due him as a council member varys was lord of nothing but the spiderweb the master of none but his whisperers the eunuch spread his soft hands on more than that i hope sweet lady i have great esteem for your husband our new hand and i know we do both love king robert yes she was forced to say for a certainty never has a king been so beloved as our robert quipped littlefinger he smiled slyly at least in lord varyss hearing good lady varys said with great solicitude there are men in the free cities with wondrous healing page powers say only the word and i will send for one for your dear bran maester luwin is doing all that can be done for bran she told him she would not speak of bran not here not with these men she trusted littlefinger only a little and varys not at all she would not let them see her grief lord baelish tells me that i have you to thank for bringing me here varys giggled like a little girl oh yes i suppose i am guilty i hope you forgive me kind lady he eased himself down into a seat and put his hands together i wonder if we might trouble you to show us the dagger catelyn stark stared at the eunuch in stunned disbelief he was a spider she thought wildly an enchanter or worse he knew things no one could possibly know unless what have you done to ser rodrik she demanded littlefinger was lost i feel rather like the knight who arrives at the battle without his lance what dagger are we talking about who is ser rodrik ser rodrik cassel is masteratarms at winterfell varys informed him i assure you lady stark nothing at all has been done to the good knight he did call here early this afternoon he visited with ser aron santagar in the armory and they talked of a certain dagger about sunset they left the castle together and walked to that dreadful hovel where you were staying they are still there drinking in the common room waiting for your return ser rodrik was very distressed to find you gone
